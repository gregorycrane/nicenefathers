<head>ANF03. Latin Christianity: Its Founder, Tertullian</head>
<p>Author(s): Tertullian (c. 160-c. 230)</p>
<p>Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Menzies, Allan (1845-1916) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: Originally printed in 1885, the ten-volume set, Ante-Nicene
Fathers, brings together the work of early Christian thinkers.
In particular, it brings together the writings of the early Church
fathers prior to the fourth century Nicene Creed. These
volumes are noteworthy for their inclusion of entire texts, and
not simply fragments or excerpts from these great writings.
The translations are fairly literal, providing both readers and
scholars with a good approximation of the originals. This
particular volume focuses on the work of Tertullian, who is
often called the "father of Latin Christianity." It brings together
three of his most important works. These writings were
heavily influential on the early Church, and for good reason,
as they are inspirational and encouraging. These volumes
also come with many useful notes, providing the reader with
new levels of understanding. Overall, Ante-Nicene Fathers,
or any part of it, is a welcome addition to one's reading list.</p>

<p>The Hatred Felt by the Heathen Against the Christians is Unjust, Because 
Based on Culpable Ignorance.223</p>
<p>The Heathen Perverted Judgment in the Trial of Christians. They Would Be 
More Consistent If They Dispensed with All Form of Trial. Tertullian Urges
This with Much Indignation.225</p>
<p>The Great Offence in the Christians Lies in Their Very Name. The Name 
Vindicated.227</p>
<p>The Truth Hated in the Christians; So in Measure Was It, of Old, in Socrates. 
The Virtues of the Christians.229</p>

<pb n="vii"/>
<p>The Inconsistent Life of Any False Christian No More Condemns True 
Disciples of Christ, Than a Passing Cloud Obscures a Summer Sky.232</p>
<p>The Innocence of the Christians Not Compromised by the Iniquitous Laws 
Which Were Made Against Them.234</p>
<p>The Christians Defamed. A Sarcastic Description of Fame; Its Deception and 
Atrocious Slanders of the Christians Lengthily Described.236</p>
<p>The Calumny Against the Christians Illustrated in the Discovery of 
Psammetichus. Refutation of the Story.241</p>
<p>The Christians are Not the Cause of Public Calamities: There Were Such 
Troubles Before Christianity.243</p>
<p>The Christians are Not the Only Contemners of the Gods. Contempt of Them 
Often Displayed by Heathen Official Persons. Homer Made the Gods
Contemptible.245</p>
<p>The Absurd Cavil of the Ass's Head Disposed of. 252</p>
<p>The Charge of Worshipping a Cross. The Heathens Themselves Made Much 
of Crosses in Sacred Things; Nay, Their Very Idols Were Formed on a Crucial
Frame.253</p>
<p>The Charge of Worshipping the Sun Met by a Retort. 256</p>
<p>The Vile Calumny About Onocoetes Retorted on the Heathen by Tertullian. 257</p>
<p>The Charge of Infanticide Retorted on the Heathen. 258</p>
<p>Other Charges Repelled by the Same Method. The Story of the Noble Roman 
Youth and His Parents.260</p>
<p>The Christian Refusal to Swear by the Genius of Cæsar. Flippancy and 
Irreverence Retorted on the Heathen.263</p>
<p>Christians Charged with an Obstinate Contempt of Death. Instances of the 
Same are Found Amongst the Heathen.265</p>
<p>If Christians and the Heathen Thus Resemble Each Other, There is Great 
Difference in the Grounds and Nature of Their Apparently Similar Conduct.267</p>
<p>Truth and Reality Pertain to Christians Alone. The Heathen Counselled to 
Examine and Embrace It.268</p>
<p>Book II 270</p>
<p>The Heathen Gods from Heathen Authorities. Varro Has Written a Work on 
the Subject. His Threefold Classification. The Changeable Character of that
Which Ought to Be Fixed and Certain.270</p>
<p>Philosophers Had Not Succeeded in Discovering God. The Uncertainty and 
Confusion of Their Speculations.273</p>

<pb n="viii"/>
<p>The Physical Philosophers Maintained the Divinity of the Elements; The 
Absurdity of the Tenet Exposed.275</p>
<p>Wrong Derivation of the Word Qeός. The Name Indicative of the True Deity. 
God Without Shape and Immaterial. Anecdote of Thales.278</p>
<p>The Physical Theory Continued. Further Reasons Advanced Against the 
Divinity of the Elements.280</p>
<p>The Changes of the Heavenly Bodies, Proof that They are Not Divine. 
Transition from the Physical to the Mythic Class of Gods.283</p>
<p>The Gods of the Mythic Class. The Poets a Very Poor Authority in Such 
Matters. Homer and the Mythic Poets. Why Irreligious.284</p>
<p>The Gods of the Different Nations. Varro's Gentile Class. Their Inferiority. 
A Good Deal of This Perverse Theology Taken from Scripture. Serapis a
Perversion of Joseph.287</p>
<p>The Power of Rome. Romanized Aspect of All the Heathen Mythology. Varro's 
Threefold Distribution Criticised. Roman Heroes (Æneas Included,)
Unfavourably Reviewed.289</p>
<p>A Disgraceful Feature of the Roman Mythology. It Honours Such Infamous 
Characters as Larentina.292</p>
<p>The Romans Provided Gods for Birth, Nay, Even Before Birth, to Death. Much 
Indelicacy in This System.294</p>
<p>The Original Deities Were Human--With Some Very Questionable 
Characteristics. Saturn or Time Was Human. Inconsistencies of Opinion
About Him.296</p>
<p>The Gods Human at First. Who Had the Authority to Make Them Divine? 
Jupiter Not Only Human, But Immoral.300</p>
<p>Gods, Those Which Were Confessedly Elevated to the Divine Condition, 
What Pre-Eminent Right Had They to Such Honour? Hercules an Inferior
Character.303</p>
<p>The Constellations and the Genii Very Indifferent Gods. The Roman Monopoly 
of Gods Unsatisfactory. Other Nations Require Deities Quite as Much.306</p>
<p>Inventors of Useful Arts Unworthy of Deification. They Would Be the First 
to Acknowledge a Creator. The Arts Changeable from Time to Time, and
Some Become Obsolete.308</p>
<p>Conclusion, the Romans Owe Not Their Imperial Power to Their Gods. The 
Great God Alone Dispenses Kingdoms, He is the God of the Christians.309</p>

<p>Elucidations. 376</p>
<p>A Treatise on the Soul. 377</p>
<p>It is Not to the Philosophers that We Resort for Information About the Soul 
But to God.377</p>
<p>The Christian Has Sure and Simple Knowledge Concerning the Subject Before 
Us.380</p>
<p>The Soul's Origin Defined Out of the Simple Words of Scripture. 383</p>
<p>In Opposition to Plato, the Soul Was Created and Originated at Birth. 385</p>

<pb n="x"/>
<p>Probable View of the Stoics, that the Soul Has a Corporeal Nature. 386</p>
<p>The Arguments of the Platonists for the Soul's Incorporeality, Opposed, Perhaps 
Frivolously.388</p>
<p>The Soul's Corporeality Demonstrated Out of the Gospels. 391</p>
<p>Other Platonist Arguments Considered. 392</p>
<p>Particulars of the Alleged Communication to a Montanist Sister. 394</p>
<p>The Simple Nature of the Soul is Asserted with Plato. The Identity of Spirit and 
Soul.397</p>
<p>Spirit--A Term Expressive of an Operation of the Soul, Not of Its Nature. To 
Be Carefully Distinguished from the Spirit of God.400</p>
<p>Difference Between the Mind and the Soul, and the Relation Between Them. 402</p>
<p>The Soul's Supremacy. 404</p>
<p>The Soul Variously Divided by the Philosophers; This Division is Not a Material 
Dissection.405</p>
<p>The Soul's Vitality and Intelligence. Its Character and Seat in Man. 407</p>
<p>The Soul's Parts. Elements of the Rational Soul. 409</p>
<p>The Fidelity of the Senses, Impugned by Plato, Vindicated by Christ Himself. 411</p>
<p>Plato Suggested Certain Errors to the Gnostics. Functions of the Soul. 415</p>
<p>The Intellect Coeval with the Soul in the Human Being. An Example from 
Aristotle Converted into Evidence Favourable to These Views.419</p>
<p>The Soul, as to Its Nature Uniform, But Its Faculties Variously Developed. 
Varieties Only Accidental.422</p>
<p>As Free-Will Actuates an Individual So May His Character Change. 424</p>
<p>Recapitulation. Definition of the Soul. 426</p>
<p>The Opinions of Sundry Heretics Which Originate Ultimately with Plato. 427</p>
<p>Plato's Inconsistency. He Supposes the Soul Self-Existent, Yet Capable of 
Forgetting What Passed in a Previous State.428</p>
<p>Tertullian Refutes, Physiologically, the Notion that the Soul is Introduced After 
Birth.431</p>
<p>Scripture Alone Offers Clear Knowledge on the Questions We Have Been 
Controverting.434</p>
<p>Soul and Body Conceived, Formed and Perfected in Element Simultaneously. 436</p>
<p>The Pythagorean Doctrine of Transmigration Sketched and Censured. 438</p>

<pb n="xi"/>
<p>The Pythagorean Doctrine Refuted by Its Own First Principle, that Living Men 
are Formed from the Dead.440</p>
<p>Further Refutation of the Pythagorean Theory. The State of Contemporary 
Civilisation.441</p>
<p>Further Exposure of Transmigration, Its Inextricable Embarrassment. 443</p>
<p>Empedocles Increased the Absurdity of Pythagoras by Developing the 
Posthumous Change of Men into Various Animals.445</p>
<p>The Judicial Retribution of These Migrations Refuted with Raillery. 448</p>
<p>These Vagaries Stimulated Some Profane Corruptions of Christianity. The 
Profanity of Simon Magus Condemned.451</p>
<p>The Opinions of Carpocrates, Another Offset from the Pythagorean Dogmas, 
Stated and Confuted.453</p>
<p>The Main Points of Our Author's Subject. On the Sexes of the Human Race. 456</p>
<p>On the Formation and State of the Embryo. Its Relation with the Subject of This 
Treatise.457</p>
<p>On the Growth of the Soul. Its Maturity Coincident with the Maturity of the 
Flesh in Man.459</p>
<p>The Evil Spirit Has Marred the Purity of the Soul from the Very Birth. 461</p>
<p>The Body of Man Only Ancillary to the Soul in the Commission of Evil. 462</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the Depravity of Man's Soul by Original Sin, There is Yet Left 
a Basis Whereon Divine Grace Can Work for Its Recovery by Spiritual
Regeneration.463</p>
<p>Sleep, the Mirror of Death, as Introductory to the Consideration of Death. 464</p>
<p>Sleep a Natural Function as Shown by Other Considerations, and by the 
Testimony of Scripture.465</p>
<p>The Story of Hermotimus, and the Sleeplessness of the Emperor Nero. No 
Separation of the Soul from the Body Until Death.468</p>
<p>Dreams, an Incidental Effect of the Soul's Activity. Ecstasy. 469</p>
<p>Diversity of Dreams and Visions. Epicurus Thought Lightly of Them, Though 
Generally Most Highly Valued. Instances of Dreams.471</p>
<p>Dreams Variously Classified. Some are God-Sent, as the Dreams of 
Nebuchadnezzar; Others Simply Products of Nature.474</p>
<p>Causes and Circumstances of Dreams. What Best Contributes to Efficient

<p>No Soul Naturally Exempt from Dreams. 477</p>

<pb n="xii"/>
<p>The Absurd Opinion of Epicurus and the Profane Conceits of the Heretic 
Menander on Death, Even Enoch and Elijah Reserved for Death.478</p>
<p>Death Entirely Separates the Soul from the Body. 480</p>
<p>All Kinds of Death a Violence to Nature, Arising from Sin.--Sin an Intrusion 
Upon Nature as God Created It.482</p>
<p>The Entire Soul Being Indivisible Remains to the Last Act of Vitality; Never 
Partially or Fractionally Withdrawn from the Body.483</p>
<p>Whither Does the Soul Retire When It Quits the Body? Opinions of Philosophers 
All More or Less Absurd. The Hades of Plato.485</p>
<p>The Christian Idea of the Position of Hades; The Blessedness of Paradise 
Immediately After Death. The Privilege of the Martyrs.486</p>
<p>Refutation of the Homeric View of the Soul's Detention from Hades Owing to 
the Body's Being Unburied. That Souls Prematurely Separated from the Body
Had to Wait for Admission into Hades Also Refuted.488</p>
<p>Magic and Sorcery Only Apparent in Their Effects. God Alone Can Raise the 
Dead.491</p>
<p>Conclusion. Points Postponed. All Souls are Kept in Hades Until the 
Resurrection, Anticipating Their Ultimate Misery or Bliss.494</p>

<p>Analogy Between Fevers and Heresies. Heresies Not to Be Wondered At: Their 
Strength Derived from Weakness of Men's Faith. They Have Not the Truth.
Simile of Pugilists and Gladiators in Illustration.503</p>
<p>Weak People Fall an Easy Prey to Heresy, Which Derives Strength from the 
General Frailty of Mankind. Eminent Men Have Fallen from Faith; Saul, David,
Solomon. The Constancy of Christ.504</p>
<p>Warnings Against Heresy Given Us in the New Testament. Sundry Passages 
Adduced. These Imply the Possibility of Falling into Heresy.506</p>
<p>Heresy, as Well as Schism and Dissension, Disapproved by St. Paul, Who Speaks 
of the Necessity of Heresies, Not as a Good, But, by the Will of God, Salutary
Trials for Training and Approving the Faith of Christians.507</p>

<pb n="xiii"/>
<p>Heretics are Self-Condemned. Heresy is Self-Will, Whilst Faith is Submission 
of Our Will to the Divine Authority. The Heresy of Apelles.508</p>
<p>Pagan Philosophy the Parent of Heresies. The Connection Between Deflections 
from Christian Faith and the Old Systems of Pagan Philosophy.509</p>
<p>Christ's Word, Seek, and Ye Shall Find, No Warrant for Heretical Deviations 
from the Faith. All Christ's Words to the Jews are for Us, Not Indeed as Specific
Commands, But as Principles to Be Applied.511</p>
<p>The Research After Definite Truth Enjoined on Us. When We Have Discovered 
This, We Should Be Content.513</p>
<p>One Has Succeeded in Finding Definite Truth, When He Believes. Heretical 
Wits are Always Offering Many Things for Vain Discussion, But We are Not
to Be Always Seeking.514</p>
<p>After We Have Believed, Search Should Cease; Otherwise It Must End in a 
Denial of What We Have Believed. No Other Object Proposed for Our Faith.516</p>
<p>A Proper Seeking After Divine Knowledge, Which Will Never Be Out of Place 
or Excessive, is Always Within the Rule of Faith.517</p>
<p>Summary of the Creed, or Rule of Faith. No Questions Ever Raised About It by 
Believers. Heretics Encourage and Perpetuate Thought Independent of Christ's
Teaching.518</p>
<p>Curiosity Ought Not Range Beyond the Rule of Faith. Restless Curiosity, the 
Feature of Heresy.519</p>
<p>Heretics Not to Be Allowed to Argue Out of the Scriptures. The Scriptures, in 
Fact, Do Not Belong to Them.521</p>
<p>Apostolic Sanction to This Exclusion of Heretics from the Use of the Scriptures. 
Heretics, According to the Apostle, are Not to Be Disputed With, But to Be
Admonished.522</p>
<p>Heretics, in Fact, Do Not Use, But Only Abuse, Scripture. No Common Ground 
Between Them and You.523</p>
<p>Great Evil Ensues to the Weak in Faith, from Any Discussion Out of the 
Scriptures. Conviction Never Comes to the Heretic from Such a Process.524</p>
<p>Appeal, in Discussion of Heresy, Lies Not to the Scriptures. The Scriptures 
Belong Only to Those Who Have the Rule of Faith.525</p>
<p>Christ First Delivered the Faith. The Apostles Spread It; They Founded Churches 
as the Depositories Thereof. That Faith, Therefore, is Apostolic, Which
Descended from the Apostles, Through Apostolic Churches.526</p>

<pb n="xiv"/>
<p>All Doctrine True Which Comes Through the Church from the Apostles, Who 
Were Taught by God Through Christ. All Opinion Which Has No Such Divine
Origin and Apostolic Tradition to Show, is Ipso Facto False.528</p>
<p>Attempt to Invalidate This Rule of Faith Rebutted. The Apostles Safe 
Transmitters of the Truth. Sufficiently Taught at First, and Faithful in the
Transmission.529</p>
<p>The Apostles Not Ignorant. The Heretical Pretence of St. Peter's Imperfection 
Because He Was Rebuked by St. Paul. St. Peter Not Rebuked for Error in
Teaching.531</p>
<p>St. Peter's Further Vindication. St. Paul Not Superior to St. Peter in Teaching. 
Nothing Imparted to the Former in the Third Heaven Enabled Him to Add to
the Faith. Heretics Boast as If Favoured with Some of the Secrets Imparted to
Him.533</p>
<p>The Apostles Did Not Keep Back Any of the Deposit of Doctrine Which Christ 
Had Entrusted to Them. St. Paul Openly Committed His Whole Doctrine to
Timothy.534</p>
<p>The Apostles Did in All Cases Teach the Whole Truth to the Whole Church. 
No Reservation, Nor Partial Communication to Favourite Friends.536</p>
<p>Granted that the Apostles Transmitted the Whole Doctrine of Truth, May Not 
the Churches Have Been Unfaithful in Handing It On? Inconceivable that This
Can Have Been the Case.538</p>
<p>The One Tradition of the Faith, Which is Substantially Alike in the Churches 
Everywhere, a Good Proof that the Transmission Has Been True and Honest
in the Main.539</p>
<p>The Truth Not Indebted to the Care of the Heretics; It Had Free Course Before 
They Appeared. Priority of the Church's Doctrine a Mark of Its Truth.540</p>
<p>Comparative Lateness of Heresies. Marcion's Heresy. Some Personal Facts About 
Him. The Heresy of Apelles. Character of This Man; Philumene; Valentinus;
Nigidius, and Hermogenes.541</p>
<p>Truth First, Falsehood Afterwards, as Its Perversion. Christ's Parable Puts the 
Sowing of the Good Seed Before the Useless Tares.544</p>
<p>None of the Heretics Claim Succession from the Apostles. New Churches Still 
Apostolic, Because Their Faith is that Which the Apostles Taught and Handed
Down. The Heretics Challenged to Show Any Apostolic Credentials.545</p>
<p>Present Heresies (Seedlings of the Tares Noted by the Sacred Writers) Already 
Condemned in Scripture. This Descent of Later Heresy from the Earlier Traced
in Several Instances.547</p>

<pb n="xv"/>
<p>No Early Controversy Respecting the Divine Creator; No Second God Introduced 
at First. Heresies Condemned Alike by the Sentence and the Silence of Holy
Scripture.549</p>
<p>Let Heretics Maintain Their Claims by a Definite and Intelligible Evidence. This 
the Only Method of Solving Their Questions. Catholics Appeal Always to
Evidence Traceable to Apostolic Sources.551</p>
<p>The Apostolic Churches the Voice of the Apostles. Let the Heretics Examine 
Their Apostolic Claims, in Each Case, Indisputable. The Church of Rome Doubly
Apostolic; Its Early Eminence and Excellence. Heresy, as Perverting the Truth,
is Connected Therewith.552</p>
<p>Heretics Not Being Christians, But Rather Perverters of Christ's Teaching, May 
Not Claim the Christian Scriptures. These are a Deposit, Committed to and
Carefully Kept by the Church.554</p>
<p>Harmony of the Church and the Scriptures. Heretics Have Tampered with the 
Scriptures, and Mutilated, and Altered Them. Catholics Never Change the
Scriptures, Which Always Testify for Them.555</p>
<p>What St. Paul Calls Spiritual Wickednesses Displayed by Pagan Authors, and 
by Heretics, in No Dissimilar Manner. Holy Scripture Especially Liable to
Heretical Manipulation. Affords Material for Heresies, Just as Virgil Has Been
the Groundwork of Literary Plagiarisms, Different in Purport from the Original.557</p>
<p>No Difference in the Spirit of Idolatry and of Heresy. In the Rites of Idolatry, 
Satan Imitated and Distorted the Divine Institutions of the Older Scriptures.
The Christian Scriptures Corrupted by Him in the Perversions of the Various
Heretics.558</p>
<p>The Conduct of Heretics: Its Frivolity, Worldliness, and Irregularity. The 
Notorious Wantonness of Their Women.560</p>
<p>Heretics Work to Pull Down and to Destroy, Not to Edify and Elevate. Heretics 
Do Not Adhere Even to Their Own Traditions, But Harbour Dissent Even from
Their Own Founders.561</p>
<p>Loose Company Preferred by Heretics. Ungodliness the Effect of Their Teaching 
the Very Opposite of Catholic Truth, Which Promotes the Fear of God, Both
in Religious Ordinances and Practical Life.562</p>
<p>Heresy Lowers Respect for Christ, and Destroys All Fear of His Great Judgment. 
The Tendency of Heretical Teaching on This Solemn Article of the Faith. The
Present Treatise an Introduction to Certain Other Anti-Heretical Works of Our
Author.563</p>
<p>Elucidations. 565</p>

<pb n="xvi"/>
<p>The Five Books Against Marcion. 569</p>
<p>Introductory Notes. 569</p>
<p>Book I. Wherein is described the god of Marcion. He is shown to be utterly 
wanting in all the attributes of the true God.573</p>
<p>Preface. Reason for a New Work. Pontus Lends Its Rough Character to the 
Heretic Marcion, a Native. His Heresy Characterized in a Brief Invective.573</p>
<p>Marcion, Aided by Cerdon, Teaches a Duality of Gods; How He Constructed 
This Heresy of an Evil and a Good God.576</p>
<p>The Unity of God. He is the Supreme Being, and There Cannot Be a Second 
Supreme.578</p>
<p>Defence of the Divine Unity Against Objection. No Analogy Between Human 
Powers and God's Sovereignty. The Objection Otherwise Untenable, for Why
Stop at Two Gods?580</p>
<p>The Dual Principle Falls to the Ground; Plurality of Gods, of Whatever 
Number, More Consistent. Absurdity and Injury to Piety Resulting from
Marcion's Duality.582</p>
<p>Marcion Untrue to His Theory. He Pretends that His Gods are Equal, But He 
Really Makes Them Diverse. Then, Allowing Their Divinity, Denies This
Diversity.584</p>
<p>Other Beings Besides God are in Scripture Called God. This Objection 
Frivolous, for It is Not a Question of Names. The Divine Essence is the Thing
at Issue. Heresy, in Its General Terms, Thus Far Treated.586</p>
<p>Specific Points. The Novelty of Marcion's God Fatal to His Pretensions. God 
is from Everlasting, He Cannot Be in Any Wise New.588</p>
<p>Marcion's Gnostic Pretensions Vain, for the True God is Neither Unknown 
Nor Uncertain. The Creator, Whom He Owns to Be God, Alone Supplies an
Induction, by Which to Judge of the True God.589</p>
<p>The Creator Was Known as the True God from the First by His Creation. 
Acknowledged by the Soul and Conscience of Man Before He Was Revealed
by Moses.592</p>
<p>The Evidence for God External to Him; But the External Creation Which 
Yields This Evidence is Really Not Extraneous, for All Things are God's.
Marcion's God, Having Nothing to Show for Himself, No God at All. Marcion's
Scheme Absurdly Defective, Not Furnishing Evidence for His New God's
Existence, Which Should at Least Be Able to Compete with the Full Evidence
of the Creator.593</p>

<pb n="xvii"/>
<p>Impossibility of Acknowledging God Without This External Evidence Of His 
Existence. Marcion's Rejection of Such Evidence for His God Savours of
Impudence and Malignity.596</p>
<p>The Marcionites Depreciate the Creation, Which, However, is a Worthy 
Witness of God. This Worthiness Illustrated by References to the Heathen
Philosophers, Who Were Apt to Invest the Several Parts of Creation with
Divine Attributes.598</p>
<p>All Portions of Creation Attest the Excellence of the Creator, Whom Marcion 
Vilifies. His Inconsistency Herein Exposed. Marcion's Own God Did Not
Hesitate to Use the Creator's Works in Instituting His Own Religion.600</p>
<p>The Lateness of the Revelation of Marcion's God. The Question of the Place 
Occupied by the Rival Deities. Instead of Two Gods, Marcion Really (Although,
as It Would Seem, Unconsciously) Had Nine Gods in His System.602</p>
<p>Marcion Assumes the Existence of Two Gods from the Antithesis Between 
Things Visible and Things Invisible. This Antithetical Principle in Fact
Characteristic of the Works of the Creator, the One God--Maker of All Things
Visible and Invisible.604</p>
<p>Not Enough, as the Marcionites Pretend, that the Supreme God Should Rescue 
Man; He Must Also Have Created Him. The Existence of God Proved by His
Creation, a Prior Consideration to His Character.606</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Their Conceits, the God of the Marcionites Fails in the 
Vouchers Both of Created Evidence and of Adequate Revelation.608</p>
<p>Jesus Christ, the Revealer of the Creator, Could Not Be the Same as Marcion's 
God, Who Was Only Made Known by the Heretic Some CXV. Years After
Christ, and That, Too, on a Principle Utterly Unsuited to the Teaching of
Jesus Christ, I.e., the Opposition Between the Law and the Gospels.610</p>
<p>Marcion, Justifying His Antithesis Between the Law and the Gospel by the 
Contention of St. Paul with St. Peter, Shown to Have Mistaken St. Paul's
Position and Argument. Marcion's Doctrine Confuted Out of St. Paul's
Teaching, Which Agrees Wholly with the Creator's Decrees.612</p>
<p>St. Paul Preached No New God, When He Announced the Repeal of Some of 
God's Ancient Ordinances. Never Any Hesitation About Belief in the Creator,
as the God Whom Christ Revealed, Until Marcion's Heresy.614</p>
<p>God's Attribute of Goodness Considered as Natural; The God of Marcion 
Found Wanting Herein. It Came Not to Man's Rescue When First Wanted.616</p>
<p>God's Attribute of Goodness Considered as Rational. Marcion's God Defective 
Here Also; His Goodness Irrational and Misapplied.619</p>

<pb n="xviii"/>
<p>The Goodness of Marcion's God Only Imperfectly Manifested; It Saves But 
Few, and the Souls Merely of These. Marcion's Contempt of the Body Absurd.622</p>
<p>God is Not a Being of Simple Goodness; Other Attributes Belong to Him. 
Marcion Shows Inconsistency in the Portraiture of His Simply Good and
Emotionless God.625</p>
<p>In the Attribute of Justice, Marcion's God is Hopelessly Weak and Ungodlike. 
He Dislikes Evil, But Does Not Punish Its Perpetration.627</p>
<p>Dangerous Effects to Religion and Morality of the Doctrine of So Weak a 
God.629</p>
<p>This Perverse Doctrine Deprives Baptism of All Its Grace. If Marcion Be Right, 
the Sacrament Would Confer No Remission of Sins, No Regeneration, No
Gift of the Spirit.631</p>
<p>Marcion Forbids Marriage. Tertullian Eloquently Defends It as Holy, and 
Carefully Discriminates Between Marcion's Doctrine and His Own Montanism.633</p>
<p>Book II. Wherein Tertullian shows that the creator, or demiurge, whom Marcion 
calumniated, is the true and good God.636</p>
<p>The Methods of Marcion's Argument Incorrect and Absurd. The Proper 
Course of the Argument.636</p>
<p>The True Doctrine of God the Creator. The Heretics Pretended to a Knowledge 
of the Divine Being, Opposed to and Subversive of Revelation. God's Nature
and Ways Past Human Discovery. Adam's Heresy.638</p>
<p>God Known by His Works. His Goodness Shown in His Creative Energy; 
But Everlasting in Its Nature; Inherent in God, Previous to All Exhibition of
It. The First Stage of This Goodness Prior to Man.641</p>
<p>The Next Stage Occurs in the Creation of Man by the Eternal Word. Spiritual 
as Well as Physical Gifts to Man. The Blessings of Man's Free-Will.643</p>
<p>Marcion's Cavils Considered. His Objection Refuted, I.e., Man's Fall Showed 
Failure in God. The Perfection of Man's Being Lay in His Liberty, Which God
Purposely Bestowed on Him. The Fall Imputable to Man's Own Choice.646</p>
<p>This Liberty Vindicated in Respect of Its Original Creation; Suitable Also for 
Exhibiting the Goodness and the Purpose of God. Reward and Punishment
Impossible If Man Were Good or Evil Through Necessity and Not Choice.648</p>
<p>If God Had Anyhow Checked Man's Liberty, Marcion Would Have Been 
Ready with Another and Opposite Cavil. Man's Fall Foreseen by God. Provision
Made for It Remedially and Consistently with His Truth and Goodness.651</p>

<pb n="xix"/>
<p>Man, Endued with Liberty, Superior to the Angels, Overcomes Even the Angel 
Which Lured Him to His Fall, When Repentant and Resuming Obedience to
God.653</p>
<p>Another Cavil Answered, I.e., the Fall Imputable to God, Because Man's Soul 
is a Portion of the Spiritual Essence of the Creator. The Divine Afflatus Not
in Fault in the Sin of Man, But the Human Will Which Was Additional to It.654</p>
<p>Another Cavil Met, I.e., the Devil Who Instigated Man to Sin Himself the 
Creature of God. Nay, the Primeval Cherub Only Was God's Work. The
Devilish Nature Superadded by Wilfulness. In Man's Recovery the Devil is
Vanquished in a Conflict on His Own Ground.657</p>
<p>If, After Man's Sin, God Exercised His Attribute of Justice and Judgment, This 
Was Compatible with His Goodness, and Enhances the True Idea of the
Perfection of God's Character.659</p>
<p>The Attributes of Goodness and Justice Should Not Be Separated. They are 
Compatible in the True God. The Function of Justice in the Divine Being
Described.661</p>
<p>Further Description of the Divine Justice; Since the Fall of Man It Has 
Regulated the Divine Goodness. God's Claims on Our Love and Our Fear
Reconciled.662</p>
<p>Evil of Two Kinds, Penal and Criminal. It is Not of the Latter Sort that God 
is the Author, But Only of the Former, Which are Penal, and Included in His
Justice.664</p>
<p>The Severity of God Compatible with Reason and Justice. When Inflicted, 
Not Meant to Be Arbitrary, But Remedial.666</p>
<p>To the Severity of God There Belong Accessory Qualities, Compatible with 
Justice. If Human Passions are Predicated of God, They Must Not Be Measured
on the Scale of Human Imperfection.667</p>
<p>Trace God's Government in History and in His Precepts, and You Will Find 
It Full of His Goodness.670</p>
<p>Some of God's Laws Defended as Good, Which the Marcionites Impeached, 
Such as the Lex Talionis. Useful Purposes in a Social and Moral Point of View
of This, and Sundry Other Enactments.672</p>
<p>The Minute Prescriptions of the Law Meant to Keep the People Dependent 
on God. The Prophets Sent by God in Pursuance of His Goodness. Many
Beautiful Passages from Them Quoted in Illustration of This Attribute.674</p>
<p>The Marcionites Charged God with Having Instigated the Hebrews to Spoil 
the Egyptians. Defence of the Divine Dispensation in that Matter.676</p>

Jericho. The Gathering of Sticks a Violation.678</p>
<p>The Brazen Serpent and the Golden Cherubim Were Not Violations of the 
Second Commandment. Their Meaning.679</p>
<p>God's Purposes in Election and Rejection of the Same Men, Such as King Saul, 
Explained, in Answer to the Marcionite Cavil.681</p>
<p>Instances of God's Repentance, and Notably in the Case of the Ninevites, 
Accounted for and Vindicated.682</p>
<p>God's Dealings with Adam at the Fall, and with Cain After His Crime, 
Admirably Explained and Defended.685</p>
<p>The Oath of God: Its Meaning. Moses, When Deprecating God's Wrath 
Against Israel, a Type of Christ.687</p>
<p>Other Objections Considered. God's Condescension in the Incarnation. 
Nothing Derogatory to the Divine Being in This Economy. The Divine Majesty
Worthily Sustained by the Almighty Father, Never Visible to Man. Perverseness
of the Marcionite Cavils.689</p>
<p>The Tables Turned Upon Marcion, by Contrasts, in Favour of the True God. 692</p>
<p>Marcion's Own Antitheses, If Only the Title and Object of the Work Be 
Excepted, Afford Proofs of the Consistent Attributes of the True God.694</p>
<p>Book III. Wherein Christ is shown to be the Son of God, Who created the world; 
to have been predicted by the prophets; to have taken human flesh like our own,
by a real incarnation.696</p>
<p>Introductory; A Brief Statement of the Preceding Argument in Connection 
with the Subject of This Book.696</p>
<p>Why Christ's Coming Should Be Previously Announced. 698</p>
<p>Miracles Alone, Without Prophecy, an Insufficient Evidence of Christ's 
Mission.700</p>
<p>Marcion's Christ Not the Subject of Prophecy. The Absurd Consequences of 
This Theory of the Heretic.702</p>
<p>Sundry Features of the Prophetic Style: Principles of Its Interpretation. 704</p>
<p>Community in Certain Points of Marcionite and Jewish Error. Prophecies of 
Christ's Rejection Examined.706</p>
<p>Prophecy Sets Forth Two Different Conditions of Christ, One Lowly, the 
Other Majestic. This Fact Points to Two Advents of Christ.709</p>
<p>Absurdity of Marcion's Docetic Opinions; Reality of Christ's Incarnation. 712</p>

<pb n="xxi"/>
<p>Refutation of Marcion's Objections Derived from the Cases of the Angels, 
and the Pre-Incarnate Manifestations of the Son of God.714</p>
<p>The Truly Incarnate State More Worthy of God Than Marcion's Fantastic 
Flesh.716</p>
<p>Christ Was Truly Born; Marcion's Absurd Cavil in Defence of a Putative 
Nativity.717</p>
<p>Isaiah's Prophecy of Emmanuel. Christ Entitled to that Name. 719</p>
<p>Isaiah's Prophecies Considered. The Virginity of Christ's Mother a Sign. Other 
Prophecies Also Signs. Metaphorical Sense of Proper Names in Sundry Passages
of the Prophets.720</p>
<p>Figurative Style of Certain Messianic Prophecies in the Psalms. Military 
Metaphors Applied to Christ.723</p>
<p>The Title Christ Suitable as a Name of the Creator's Son, But Unsuited to 
Marcion's Christ.725</p>
<p>The Sacred Name Jesus Most Suited to the Christ of the Creator. Joshua a 
Type of Him.727</p>
<p>Prophecies in Isaiah and the Psalms Respecting Christ's Humiliation. 729</p>
<p>Types of the Death of Christ. Isaac; Joseph; Jacob Against Simeon and Levi; 
Moses Praying Against Amalek; The Brazen Serpent.731</p>
<p>Prophecies of the Death of Christ. 733</p>
<p>The Subsequent Influence of Christ's Death in the World Predicted. The Sure 
Mercies of David. What These are.735</p>
<p>The Call of the Gentiles Under the Influence of the Gospel Foretold. 738</p>
<p>The Success of the Apostles, and Their Sufferings in the Cause of the Gospel, 
Foretold.740</p>
<p>The Dispersion of the Jews, and Their Desolate Condition for Rejecting Christ, 
Foretold.743</p>
<p>Christ's Millennial and Heavenly Glory in Company with His Saints. 746</p>
<p>Book IV. In Which Tertullian Pursues His Argument. Jesus is the Christ of the 
Creator. He Derives His Proofs from St. Luke's Gospel; That Being the Only
Historical Portion of the New Testament Partially Accepted by Marcion. This
Book May Also Be Regarded as a Commentary on St. Luke. It Gives Remarkable
Proof of Tertullian's Grasp of Scripture, and Proves that “The Old Testament
is Not Contrary to the New.“ It Also Abounds in Striking Expositions of
Scriptural Passages, Embracing Profound Views of Revelation, in Connection
with the Nature of Man.750</p>

<pb n="xxii"/>
<p>Examination of the Antitheses of Marcion, Bringing Them to the Test of 
Marcion's Own Gospel. Certain True Antitheses in the Dispensations of the
Old and the New Testaments. These Variations Quite Compatible with One
and the Same God, Who Ordered Them.750</p>
<p>St. Luke's Gospel, Selected by Marcion as His Authority, and Mutilated by 
Him. The Other Gospels Equally Authoritative. Marcion's Terms of Discussion,
However, Accepted, and Grappled with on the Footing of St. Luke's Gospel
Alone.754</p>
<p>Marcion Insinuated the Untrustworthiness of Certain Apostles Whom St. 
Paul Rebuked. The Rebuke Shows that It Cannot Be Regarded as Derogating
from Their Authority. The Apostolic Gospels Perfectly Authentic.757</p>
<p>Each Side Claims to Possess the True Gospel. Antiquity the Criterion of Truth 
in Such a Matter. Marcion's Pretensions as an Amender of the Gospel.759</p>
<p>By the Rule of Antiquity, the Catholic Gospels are Found to Be True, Including 
the Real St. Luke's. Marcion's Only a Mutilated Edition. The Heretic's Weakness
and Inconsistency in Ignoring the Other Gospels.761</p>
<p>Marcion's Object in Adulterating the Gospel. No Difference Between the 
Christ of the Creator and the Christ of the Gospel. No Rival Christ Admissible.
The Connection of the True Christ with the Dispensation of the Old Testament
Asserted.764</p>
<p>Marcion Rejected the Preceding Portion of St. Luke's Gospel. Therefore This 
Review Opens with an Examination of the Case of the Evil Spirit in the
Synagogue of Capernaum. He Whom the Demon Acknowledged Was the
Creator's Christ.766</p>
<p>Other Proofs from the Same Chapter, that Jesus, Who Preached at Nazareth, 
and Was Acknowledged by Certain Demons as Christ the Son of God, Was
the Creator's Christ. As Occasion Offers, the Docetic Errors of Marcion are
Exposed.771</p>
<p>Out of St. Luke's Fifth Chapter are Found Proofs of Christ's Belonging to the 
Creator, E.g. In the Call of Fishermen to the Apostolic Office, and in the
Cleansing of the Leper. Christ Compared with the Prophet Elisha.774</p>
<p>Further Proofs of the Same Truth in the Same Chapter, from the Healing of 
the Paralytic, and from the Designation Son of Man Which Jesus Gives Himself.
Tertullian Sustains His Argument by Several Quotations from the Prophets.779</p>
<p>The Call of Levi the Publican. Christ in Relation to the Baptist. Christ as the 
Bridegroom. The Parable of the Old Wine and the New. Arguments
Connecting Christ with the Creator.784</p>

<pb n="xxiii"/>
<p>Christ's Authority Over the Sabbath. As Its Lord He Recalled It from Pharisaic 
Neglect to the Original Purpose of Its Institution by the Creator the Case of
the Disciples Who Plucked the Ears of Corn on the Sabbath. The Withered
Hand Healed on the Sabbath.788</p>
<p>Christ's Connection with the Creator Shown. Many Quotations Out of the 
Old Testament Prophetically Bear on Certain Events of the Life of Jesus--Such
as His Ascent to Praying on the Mountain; His Selection of Twelve Apostles;
His Changing Simon's Name to Peter, and Gentiles from Tyre and Sidon
Resorting to Him.793</p>
<p>Christ's Sermon on the Mount. In Manner and Contents It So Resembles the 
Creator's Dispensational Words and Deeds. It Suggests Therefore the
Conclusion that Jesus is the Creator's Christ. The Beatitudes.796</p>
<p>Sermon on the Mount Continued. Its Woes in Strict Agreement with the
Creator's Disposition. Many Quotations Out of the Old Testament in Proof
of This.801</p>
<p>The Precept of Loving One's Enemies. It is as Much Taught in the Creator's 
Scriptures of the Old Testament as in Christ's Sermon. The Lex Talionis of
Moses Admirably Explained in Consistency with the Kindness and Love
Which Jesus Christ Came to Proclaim and Enforce in Behalf of the Creator.
Sundry Precepts of Charity Explained.806</p>
<p>Concerning Loans. Prohibition of Usury and the Usurious Spirit. The Law 
Preparatory to the Gospel in Its Provisions; So in the Present Instance. On
Reprisals. Christ's Teaching Throughout Proves Him to Be Sent by the Creator.812</p>

Baptist, and His Message to Christ; And the Woman Who Was a Sinner.

<p>Additional Note. 935   </p>
<p>Book V. Wherein Tertullian proves, with respect to St. Paul's epistles, what he 
had proved in the preceding book with respect to St. Luke's gospel. Far from
being at variance, they were in perfect unison with the writings of the Old
Testament, and therefore testified that the Creator was the only God, and that
the Lord Jesus was his Christ. As in the preceding books, Tertullian supports
his argument with profound reasoning, and many happy illustrations of Holy
Scripture.936</p>
<p>Introductory. The Apostle Paul Himself Not the Preacher of a New God.
Called by Jesus Christ, Although After the Other Apostles, His Mission Was
from the Creator. States How. The Argument, as in the Case of the Gospel,
Confining Proofs to Such Portions of St. Paul's Writings as Marcion Allowed. 936</p>
<p>On the Epistle to the Galatians. The Abolition of the Ordinances of the Mosaic 
Law No Proof of Another God. The Divine Lawgiver, the Creator Himself,

Things and Base Things.957</p>

<p>Against Hermogenes. 1038</p>
<p>The Opinions of Hermogenes, by the Prescriptive Rule of Antiquity Shown to
Be Heretical. Not Derived from Christianity, But from Heathen Philosophy.
Some of the Tenets Mentioned. 1038</p>
<p>Hermogenes, After a Perverse Induction from Mere Heretical Assumptions, 
Concludes that God Created All Things Out of Pre-Existing Matter.1040</p>
<p>An Argument of Hermogenes. The Answer: While God is a Title Eternally
Applicable to the Divine Being, Lord and Father are Only Relative Appellations,
Not Eternally Applicable. An Inconsistency in the Argument of Hermogenes
Pointed Out.1042</p>
<p>Hermogenes Gives Divine Attributes to Matter, and So Makes Two Gods. 1044</p>
<p>Hermogenes Coquets with His Own Argument, as If Rather Afraid of It. After 
Investing Matter with Divine Qualities, He Tries to Make It Somehow Inferior
to God.1045</p>
<p>The Shifts to Which Hermogenes is Reduced, Who Deifies Matter, and Yet is 
Unwilling to Hold Him Equal with the Divine Creator.1047</p>
<p>Hermogenes Held to His Theory in Order that Its Absurdity May Be Exposed 
on His Own Principles.1048</p>
<p>On His Own Principles, Hermogenes Makes Matter, on the Whole, Superior 
to God.1049</p>
<p>Sundry Inevitable But Intolerable Conclusions from the Principles of 
Hermogenes.1050</p>
<p>To What Straits Hermogenes Absurdly Reduces the Divine Being. He Does 
Nothing Short of Making Him the Author of Evil.1052</p>
<p>Hermogenes Makes Great Efforts to Remove Evil from God to Matter. How He 
Fails to Do This Consistently with His Own Argument.1054</p>
<p>The Mode of Controversy Changed. The Premisses of Hermogenes Accepted, 
in Order to Show into What Confusion They Lead Him.1056</p>
<p>Another Ground of Hermogenes that Matter Has Some Good in It. Its Absurdity. 1058</p>

<p>An Appeal to the History of Creation. True Meaning of the Term Beginning, 
Which the Heretic Curiously Wrests to an Absurd Sense.1067</p>
<p>Meaning of the Phrase--In the Beginning. Tertullian Connects It with the 
Wisdom of God, and Elicits from It the Truth that the Creation Was Not Out
of Pre-Existent Matter.1069</p>
<p>A Retort of Heresy Answered. That Scripture Should in So Many Words Tell 
Us that the World Was Made of Nothing is Superfluous.1071</p>
<p>This Conclusion Confirmed by the Usage of Holy Scripture in Its History of 
the Creation. Hermogenes in Danger of the Woe Pronounced Against Adding
to Scripture.1072</p>

Interpretation Exposed.1074</p>

Respecting Matter, Formerly Laid Down by Hermogenes.1101</p>
<p>Shapeless Matter an Incongruous Origin for God's Beautiful Cosmos. 
Hermogenes Does Not Mend His Argument by Supposing that Only a Portion
of Matter Was Used in the Creation.1102</p>

Speculations Respecting Motion in Matter, and the Material Qualities of Good
and Evil.1103</p>

of Matter.1108</p>
<p>Against the Valentinians. 1110</p>
<p>Introductory. Tertullian Compares the Heresy to the Old Eleusinian Mysteries. 
Both Systems Alike in Preferring Concealment of Error and Sin to Proclamation
of Truth and Virtue.1110</p>
<p>These Heretics Brand the Christians as Simple Persons. The Charge Accepted, 
and Simplicity Eulogized Out of the Scriptures.1112</p>
<p>The Folly of This Heresy. It Dissects and Mutilates the Deity. Contrasted with 
the Simple Wisdom of True Religion. To Expose the Absurdities of the
Valentinian System is to Destroy It.1113</p>

<pb n="xxxiii"/>
<p>The Heresy Traceable to Valentinus, an Able But Restless Man. Many 
Schismatical Leaders of the School Mentioned. Only One of Them Shows Respect
to the Man Whose Name Designates the Entire School.1115</p>
<p>Many Eminent Christian Writers Have Carefully and Fully Refuted the Heresy. 
These the Author Makes His Own Guides.1117</p>
<p>Although Writing in Latin He Proposes to Retain the Greek Names of the 
Valentinian Emanations of Deity. Not to Discuss the Heresy But Only to Expose
It. This with the Raillery Which Its Absurdity Merits.1118</p>
<p>The First Eight Emanations, or Æons, Called the Ogdoad, are the Fountain of 
All the Others. Their Names and Descent Recorded.1119</p>
<p>The Names and Descent of Other Æons; First Half a Score, Then Two More, 
and Ultimately a Dozen Besides. These Thirty Constitute the Pleroma. But
Why Be So Capricious as to Stop at Thirty?1121</p>
<p>Other Capricious Features in the System. The Æons Unequal in Attributes. The 
Superiority of Nus; The Vagaries of Sophia Restrained by Horos. Grand Titles
Borne by This Last Power.1123</p>
<p>Another Account of the Strange Aberrations of Sophia, and the Restraining 
Services of Horus. Sophia Was Not Herself, After All, Ejected from the Pleroma,
But Only Her Enthymesis.1125</p>

Their Joint Contribution of Parts Set Forth with Humorous Irony.1129</p>

Creation of the Demiurge. The Addition of Fire to the Various Elements and
Bodies of Nature.1143</p>
<p>The Formation of Man by the Demiurge. Human Flesh Not Made of the Ground, 
But of a Nondescript Philosophic Substance.1144</p>
<p>An Extravagant Way of Accounting for the Communication of the Spiritual 
Nature to Man. It Was Furtively Managed by Achamoth, Through the
Unconscious Agency of Her Son.1145</p>
<p>The Three Several Natures--The Material, the Animal, and the Spiritual, and 
Their Several Destinations. The Strange Valentinian Opinion About the
Structure of Soter's Nature.1146</p>
<p>The Christ of the Demiurge, Sent into the World by the Virgin. Not of Her. He 
Found in Her, Not a Mother, But Only a Passage or Channel. Jesus Descended
Upon Christ, at His Baptism, Like a Dove; But, Being Incapable of Suffering,
He Left Christ to Die on the Cross Alone.1147</p>
<p>The Demiurge Cured of His Ignorance by the Saviour's Advent, from Whom 
He Hears of the Great Future in Store for Himself.1148</p>
<p>The Three Natures Again Adverted to. They are All Exemplified Amongst Men. 
For Instance, by Cain, and Abel, and Seth.1149</p>

of Valentinus.1155</p>
<p>Other Varying Opinions Among the Valentinians Respecting the Deity, 
Characteristic Raillery.1156</p>
<p>Yet More Discrepancies. Just Now the Sex of Bythus Was an Object of Dispute; 
Now His Rank Comes in Question. Absurd Substitutes for Bythus Criticised by

<p>Other Turgid and Ridiculous Theories About the Origin of the Æons and

<p>Diversity in the Opinions of Secundus, as Compared with the General Doctrine 
of Valentinus.1160</p>
<p>Their Diversity of Sentiment Affects the Very Central Doctrine of Christianity,
Even the Person and Character of the Lord Jesus. This Diversity Vitiates Every
Gnostic School. 1161</p>
<p>On the Flesh of Christ. 1162</p>
<p>The General Purport of This Work. The Heretics, Marcion, Apelles, and
Valentinus, Wishing to Impugn the Doctrine of the Resurrection, Deprive Christ
of All Capacity for Such a Change by Denying His Flesh. 1162</p>
<p>Marcion, Who Would Blot Out the Record of Christ's Nativity, is Rebuked for 
So Startling a Heresy.1164</p>
<p>Christ's Nativity Both Possible and Becoming. The Heretical Opinion of Christ's
Apparent Flesh Deceptive and Dishonourable to God, Even on Marcion's
Principles. 1166</p>
<p>God's Honour in the Incarnation of His Son Vindicated. Marcion's 
Disparagement of Human Flesh Inconsistent as Well as Impious. Christ Has
Cleansed the Flesh. The Foolishness of God is Most Wise.1169</p>
<p>Christ Truly Lived and Died in Human Flesh. Incidents of His Human Life on 
Earth, and Refutation of Marcion's Docetic Parody of the Same.1171</p>
<p>The Doctrine of Apelles Refuted, that Christ's Body Was of Sidereal Substance, 
Not Born. Nativity and Mortality are Correlative Circumstances, and in Christ's
Case His Death Proves His Birth.1174</p>

<p>Apelles and His Followers, Displeased with Our Earthly Bodies, Attributed to 
Christ a Body of a Purer Sort. How Christ Was Heavenly Even in His Earthly
Flesh.1180</p>
<p>Christ's Flesh Perfectly Natural, Like Our Own. None of the Supernatural 
Features Which the Heretics Ascribed to It Discoverable, on a Careful View.1182</p>
<p>Another Class of Heretics Refuted. They Alleged that Christ's Flesh Was of a 
Finer Texture, Animalis, Composed of Soul.1184</p>
<p>The Opposite Extravagance Exposed. That is Christ with a Soul Composed of 
Flesh--Corporeal, Though Invisible. Christ's Soul, Like Ours, Distinct from
Flesh, Though Clothed in It.1185</p>
<p>The True Functions of the Soul. Christ Assumed It in His Perfect Human Nature, 
Not to Reveal and Explain It, But to Save It. Its Resurrection with the Body
Assured by Christ.1187</p>
<p>Christ's Human Nature. The Flesh and the Soul Both Fully and Unconfusedly 
Contained in It.1189</p>
<p>Christ Took Not on Him an Angelic Nature, But the Human. It Was Men, Not 
Angels, Whom He Came to Save.1191</p>
<p>The Valentinian Figment of Christ's Flesh Being of a Spiritual Nature, Examined 
and Refuted Out of Scripture.1193</p>
<p>Christ's Flesh in Nature, the Same as Ours, Only Sinless. The Difference Between

the Derivation of Their Flesh. An Analogy Also Pleasantly Traced Between Eve
and the Virgin Mary.1197</p>
<p>The Mystery of the Assumption of Our Perfect Human Nature by the Second 
Person of the Blessed Trinity. He is Here Called, as Often Elsewhere, the Spirit.1199</p>
<p>Christ, as to His Divine Nature, as the Word of God, Became Flesh, Not by 
Carnal Conception, Nor by the Will of the Flesh and of Man, But by the Will
of God. Christ's Divine Nature, of Its Own Accord, Descended into the Virgin's
Womb.1201</p>

and Exact Birth of a Human Mother, as Suggested by Certain Passages of
Scripture. 1203</p>

<pb n="xxxvii"/>
<p>The Word of God Did Not Become Flesh Except in the Virgin's Womb and of 
Her Substance. Through His Mother He is Descended from Her Great Ancestor
David. He is Described Both in the Old and in the New Testament as “The Fruit
of David's Loins.”1205</p>
<p>Holy Scripture in the New Testament, Even in Its Very First Verse, Testifies to
Christ's True Flesh. In Virtue of Which He is Incorporated in the Human Stock
of David, and Abraham, and Adam. 1207</p>
<p>Simeon's “Sign that Should Be Contradicted,” Applied to the Heretical 
Gainsaying of the True Birth of Christ. One of the Heretics' Paradoxes Turned
in Support of Catholic Truth.1209</p>
<p>Divine Strictures on Various Heretics Descried in Various Passages of Prophetical 
Scripture. Those Who Assail the True Doctrine of the One Lord Jesus Christ,

Resurrection of the Flesh,” Proving the Reality of the Flesh Which Was Truly
Born, and Died, and Rose Again. 1213</p>
<p>Elucidations. 1214</p>
<p>On the Resurrection of the Flesh. 1215</p>
<p>The Doctrine of the Resurrection of the Body Brought to Light by the Gospel. 
The Faintest Glimpses of Something Like It Occasionally Met with in
Heathenism. Inconsistencies of Pagan Teaching.1215</p>
<p>The Jewish Sadducees a Link Between the Pagan Philosophers and the Heretics 
on This Doctrine. Its Fundamental Importance Asserted. The Soul Fares Better
Than the Body, in Heretical Estimation, as to Its Future State. Its Extinction,
However, Was Held by One Lucan.1217</p>
<p>Some Truths Held Even by the Heathen. They Were, However, More Often
Wrong Both in Religious Opinions and in Moral Practice. The Heathen Not
to Be Followed in Their Ignorance of the Christian Mystery. The Heretics
Perversely Prone to Follow Them. 1220</p>
<p>Heathens and Heretics Alike in Their Vilification of the Flesh and Its Functions,
the Ordinary Cavils Against the Final Restitution of So Weak and Ignoble a
Substance. 1222</p>
<p>Some Considerations in Reply Eulogistic of the Flesh. It Was Created by God. 
The Body of Man Was, in Fact, Previous to His Soul.1224</p>
<p>Not the Lowliness of the Material, But the Dignity and Skill of the Maker, Must
Be Remembered, in Gauging the Excellence of the Flesh. Christ Partook of Our
Flesh.1226</p>

<pb n="xxxviii"/>
<p>The Earthy Material of Which Flesh is Created Wonderfully Improved by God's 
Manipulation. By the Addition of the Soul in Man's Constitution It Became the
Chief Work in the Creation.1228</p>
<p>Christianity, by Its Provision for the Flesh, Has Put on It the Greatest Honour. 
The Privileges of Our Religion in Closest Connection with Our Flesh. Which
Also Bears a Large Share in the Duties and Sacrifices of Religion.1230</p>
<p>God's Love for the Flesh of Man, as Developed in the Grace of Christ Towards 
It. The Flesh the Best Means of Displaying the Bounty and Power of God.1231</p>
<p>Holy Scripture Magnifies the Flesh, as to Its Nature and Its Prospects. 1232</p>
<p>The Power of God Fully Competent to Effect the Resurrection of the Flesh. 1233</p>
<p>Some Analogies in Nature Which Corroborate the Resurrection of the Flesh. 1235</p>
<p>From Our Author's View of a Verse in the Ninety-Second Psalm, the Phoenix 
is Made a Symbol of the Resurrection of Our Bodies.1236</p>
<p>A Sufficient Cause for the Resurrection of the Flesh Occurs in the Future 
Judgment of Man. It Will Take Cognisance of the Works of the Body No Less
Than of the Soul.1237</p>
<p>As the Flesh is a Partaker with the Soul in All Human Conduct, So Will It Be 
in the Recompense of Eternity.1239</p>
<p>The Heretics Called the Flesh “The Vessel of the Soul,” In Order to Destroy the 
Responsibility of the Body. Their Cavil Turns Upon Themselves and Shows the
Flesh to Be a Sharer in Human Actions.1241</p>
<p>The Flesh Will Be Associated with the Soul in Enduring the Penal Sentences of 1
the Final Judgment.1243</p>
<p>Scripture Phrases and Passages Clearly Assert “The Resurrection of the Dead.” 
The Force of This Very Phrase Explained as Indicating the Prominent Place of
the Flesh in the General Resurrection.1245</p>
<p>The Sophistical Sense Put by Heretics on the Phrase “Resurrection of the Dead,” 
As If It Meant the Moral Change of a New Life.1247</p>
<p>Figurative Senses Have Their Foundation in Literal Fact. Besides, the Allegorical 
Style is by No Means the Only One Found in the Prophetic Scriptures, as Alleged
by the Heretics.1248</p>
<p>No Mere Metaphor in the Phrase Resurrection of the Dead. In Proportion to 
the Importance of Eternal Truths, is the Clearness of Their Scriptural
Enunciation.1250</p>
<p>The Scriptures Forbid Our Supposing Either that the Resurrection is Already 
Past, or that It Takes Place Immediately at Death. Our Hopes and Prayers Point
to the Last Great Day as the Period of Its Accomplishment.1251</p>

Resurrection of the Flesh at the Final Judgment.1255</p>

the Bodily Resurrection, the Only Sense Which Secures Their Consistency and
Dignity.1258</p>
<p>Certain Metaphorical Terms Explained of the Resurrection of the Flesh. 1260</p>
<p>Prophetic Things and Actions, as Well as Words, Attest This Great Doctrine. 1262</p>
<p>Ezekiel's Vision of the Dry Bones Quoted. 1263 </p>
<p>This Vision Interpreted by Tertullian of the Resurrection of the Bodies of the 
Dead. A Chronological Error of Our Author, Who Supposes that Ezekiel in His
Ch. XXXI. Prophesied Before the Captivity.1264</p>

<p>Even Unburied Bodies Will Be Raised Again. Whatever Befalls Them God Will 
Restore Them Again. Jonah's Case Quoted in Illustration of God's Power.1268</p>

Explained by Himself, Have a Clear Reference to the Resurrection of the Flesh.1270</p>

Attribute. He is Shown to Be a Personal Being. 1345</p>

Emanations of Valentinus, Separable from the Father. Nor is the Holy Ghost
Separable from Either. Illustrations from Nature.1348</p>

Unconfused Distinction of the Several Persons of the Blessed Trinity.1350</p>
<p>The Very Names of Father and Son Prove the Personal Distinction of the Two. 
They Cannot Possibly Be Identical, Nor is Their Identity Necessary to Preserve
the Divine Monarchy.1352</p>
<p>The Identity of the Father and the Son, as Praxeas Held It, Shown to Be Full of

<p>The Designation of the One God in the Prophetic Scriptures. Intended as a 
Protest Against Heathen Idolatry, It Does Not Preclude the Correlative Idea of
the Son of God. The Son is in the Father.1372</p>
<p>The Son in Union with the Father in the Creation of All Things. This Union of 
the Two in Co-Operation is Not Opposed to the True Unity of God. It is Opposed
Only to Praxeas' Identification Theory.1374</p>
<p>The Scriptures Relied on by Praxeas to Support His Heresy But Few. They are 
Mentioned by Tertullian.1376</p>
<p>In This and the Four Following Chapters It is Shewn, by a Minute Analysis of 
St. John's Gospel, that the Father and Son are Constantly Spoken of as Distinct
Persons.1377</p>

and the Son. Even Praxeas' Classic Text--I and My Father are One--Shown to

in the Person of the Son. The Subterfuges of Praxeas Thus Exposed.1396</p>
<p>Christ Not the Father, as Praxeas Said. The Inconsistency of This Opinion, No 
Less Than Its Absurdity, Exposed. The True Doctrine of Jesus Christ According
to St. Paul, Who Agrees with Other Sacred Writers.1399</p>
<p>It Was Christ that Died. The Father is Incapable of Suffering Either Solely or 
with Another. Blasphemous Conclusions Spring from Praxeas' Premises.1401</p>
<p>How the Son Was Forsaken by the Father Upon the Cross. The True Meaning 
Thereof Fatal to Praxeas. So Too, the Resurrection of Christ, His Ascension,

<p>Argument.--When the Saints Were Apprehended, St. Perpetua Successfully 
Resisted Her Father's Pleading, Was Baptized with the Others, Was Thrust into
a Filthy Dungeon. Anxious About Her Infant, by a Vision Granted to Her, She
Understood that Her Martyrdom Would Take Place Very Shortly.1563</p>
<p>Argument. Perpetua, When Besieged by Her Father, Comforts Him. When Led 
with Others to the Tribunal, She Avows Herself a Christian, and is Condemned
with the Rest to the Wild Beasts. She Prays for Her Brother Dinocrates, Who
Was Dead.1565</p>
<p>Argument. Perpetua is Again Tempted by Her Father. Her Third Vision, Wherein 
She is Led Away to Struggle Against an Egyptian. She Fights, Conquers, and
Receives the Reward.1568</p>
<p>Argument. Saturus, in a Vision, and Perpetua Being Carried by Angels into the 
Great Light, Behold the Martyrs. Being Brought to the Throne of God, are
Received with a Kiss. They Reconcile Optatus the Bishop and Aspasius the
Presbyter.1570</p>
<p>Argument. Secundulus Dies in the Prison. Felicitas is Pregnant, But with Many 
Prayers She Brings Forth in the Eighth Month Without Suffering, the Courage
of Perpetua and of Saturus Unbroken.1572</p>
<p>Argument. From the Prison They are Led Forth with Joy into the Amphitheatre, 
Especially Perpetua and Felicitas. All Refuse to Put on Profane Garments. They
are Scourged, They are Thrown to the Wild Beasts. Saturus Twice is Unhurt.
Perpetua and Felicitas are Thrown Down; They are Called Back to the

<head>Preface.</head>
<p>We present a volume widely differing, in its contents, from those which have gone before;
it contains the works of the great founder of Latin Christianity, the versatile and brilliant
Tertullian. Not all his works, indeed, for they could not be contained in one of our books.
This book, however, considerably overruns the promised number of pages, and gives three
complete parts of Tertullian’s writings, according to the classification of our Editor-in-chief.
The Fourth volume will begin with the fourth class of his works, those which exhibit our
author’s ascetic ideas and the minor morals of the Primitive Christians, that collection being
closed by the four treatises which were written in support of a defined and schismatical
Montanism.</p>
<p>The Editor-in-chief has been in active correspondence with representative men of divers
theological schools, hoping to secure their co-operation in editorial work. As yet, however,
the result has not enabled us to announce more than one additional collaborator: the
rapidity with which the successive volumes must be furnished proving an almost insurmountable
obstacle in the way of securing as co-workers, divines actively engaged in professional
duties and literary tasks. The sympathy and encouragement which have been expressed by
all with whom a correspondence has been opened, have been most cheering. To the Rev.
Dr. Riddle, of Hartford, well known as one of the most learned of the AmericaHærn Revisers
of the New Testament, we are indebted for his consent to edit one of the concluding volumes
of the Series, accompanying it with a Bibliographical Review of the entire Literature of the
Patrologia of the Ante-Nicene period: supplying therein a compendious view of all the
writers upon this period and of the latest critical editions of the Ante-Nicene authors
themselves. The editor-in-chief will continue his annotations and the usual prefaces, in
Professor Riddle’s volume, but will be relieved, in some degree, of the laborious and minute
attention to details which earlier volumes have necessarily exacted.</p>
<p>It is needful to remind the reader that he possesses in this volume what has long been
a desideratum among divines. The crabbed Latin of the great Tertullian has been thought
to defy translation: and the variety and uncertain dates of his works have rendered classification
and arrangement almost an equal difficulty. But here is the work achieved by competent
hands, and now, for the first time, reduced to orderly and methodical plan. We have little
doubt that the student on comparing our edition with that of the Edinburgh Series, will
congratulate himself on the great gain of the arrangement; and we trust the original matter
with which it is illustrated may be found not less acceptable.</p>

<head>Introductory Note.</head>
<p>[a.d. 145–220.] When our Lord repulsed the woman of Canaan (Matt. xv. 22) with apparent
harshness, he applied to her people the epithet dogs, with which the children of Israel
had thought it piety to reproach them. When He accepted her faith and caused it to be recorded
for our learning, He did something more: He reversed the curse of the Canaanite
and showed that the Church was designed “for all people;” Catholic alike for all time and
for all sorts and conditions of men.</p>
<p>Thus the North-African Church was loved before it was born: the Good Shepherd was
gently leading those “that were with young.” Here was the charter of those Christians to be
a Church, who then were Canaanites in the land of their father Ham. It is remarkable indeed
that among these pilgrims and strangers to the West the first elements of Latin Christianity
come into view. Even at the close of the Second Century the Church in Rome is an inconsiderable,
though prominent, member of the great confederation of Christian Churches
which has its chief seats in Alexandria and Antioch, and of which the entire Literature is
Greek. It is an African presbyter who takes from Latin Christendom the reproach of theological
and literary barrenness and begins the great work in which, upon his foundations,
Cyprian and Augustine built up, with incomparable genius, that Carthaginian School of
Christian thought by which Latin Theology was dominated for centuries. It is important to
note (1.) that providentially not one of these illustrious doctors died in Communion with
the Roman See, pure though it was and venerable at that time; and (2.) that to the works of
Augustine the Reformation in Germany and Continental Europe was largely due; while (3.)
the specialties of the Anglican Reformation were, in like proportion, due to the writings of
Tertullian and Cyprian. The hinges of great and controlling destinies for Western Europe
and our own America are to be found in the period we are now approaching.</p>
<p>The merest school-boy knows much of the history of Carthage, and how the North
Africans became Roman citizens. How they became Christians is not so clear. A melancholy
destiny has enveloped Carthage from the outset, and its glory and greatness as a Christian
See were transient indeed. It blazed out all at once in Tertullian, after about a century of
missionary labours had been exerted upon its creation: and having given a Minucius Felix,
an Arnobius and a Lactantius to adorn the earliest period of Western Ecclesiastical learning,
in addition to its nobler luminaries, it rapidly declined. At the beginning of the Third Century,
at a council presided over by Agrippinus, Bishop of Carthage, there were present not less
than seventy bishops of the Province. A period of cruel persecutions followed, and the
African Church received a baptism of blood.</p>
<p>Tertullian was born a heathen, and seems to have been educated at Rome, where he
probably practiced as a jurisconsult. We may, perhaps, adopt most of the ideas of Allix, as

<pb n="6"/>
conjecturally probable, and assign his birth to a.d. 145. He became a Christian about 185,
and a presbyter about 190. The period of his strict orthodoxy very nearly expires with the
century. He lived to an extreme old age, and some suppose even till a.d. 240. More probably
we must adopt the date preferred by recent writers, a.d. 220.</p>
<p>It seems to be the fashion to treat of Tertullian as a Montanist, and only incidentally to
celebrate his services to the Catholic Orthodoxy of Western Christendom. Were I his biographer
I should reverse this course, as a mere act of justice, to say nothing of gratitude to
a man of splendid intellect, to whom the filial spirit of Cyprian accorded the loving tribute
of a disciple, and whose genius stamped itself upon the very words of Latin theology, and
prepared the language for the labours of a Jerome. In creating the Vulgate, and so lifting
the Western Churches into a position of intellectual equality with the East, the latter as well
as St. Augustine himself were debtors to Tertullian in a degree not to be estimated by any
other than the Providential Mind that inspired his brilliant career as a Christian.</p>
<p>In speaking of Tatian I laid the base for what I wished to say of Tertullian. Let God only
be their judge; let us gratefully recognize the debt we owe to them. Let us read them, as we
read the works of King Solomon. We must, indeed, approve of the discipline of the Primitive
Age, which allowed of no compromises. The Church was struggling for existence, and could
not permit any man to become her master. The more brilliant the intellect, the more dangerous
to the poor Church were its perversions of her Testimony. Before the heathen
tribunals, and in the market-places, it would not answer to let Christianity appear doubletongued.
The orthodoxy of the Church, not less than her children, was undergoing an ordeal
of fire. It seems a miracle that her Testimony preserved its unity, and that heresy was branded
as such by the instinct of the Faithful. Poor Tertullian was cut off by his own act. The
weeping Church might bewail him as David mourned for Absalom, but like David, she
could not give the Ark of God into other hands than those of the loyal and the true. I have
set the writings of Tertullian in a natural and logical order1, so as to aid the student, and to
relieve him from the distractions of such an arrangement as one finds in Oehler’s edition.
Valuable as it is, the practical use of it is irritating and confusing. The reader of that edition
may turn to the slightly differing schemes of Neander and Kaye, for a theoretical order of
the works; but here he will find a classification which will aid his inquiries. He will find,
first, those works which connect with the Apologists of the former volumes of this series:
which illustrate the Church’s position toward the outside world, the Jews as well as the
Gentiles. Next come those works which contend with internal differences and heresies. And
then, those which reflect the morals and manners of Christians. These are classed with some
reference to their degrees of freedom from the Montanistic taint, and are followed, last of
<note type="footnote">1 Elucidation I.</note>

<pb n="7"/>
all, by the few tracts which belong to the melancholy period of his lapse, and are directed
against the Church’s orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Let it be borne in mind, that if this sad close of Tertullian’s career cannot be extenuated,
the later history of Latin Christianity forbids us to condemn him, in the tones which proceeded
from the Virgin Church with authority, and which the law of her testimony and the
instinct of self-preservation forced her to utter. Let us reflect that St. Bernard and after him
the Schoolmen, whom we so deservedly honour, separated themselves far more absolutely
than ever Tertullian did from the orthodoxy of Primitive Christendom. The schism which
withdrew the West from Communion with the original seats of Christendom, and from
Nicene Catholicity, was formidable beyond all expression, in comparison with Tertullian’s
entanglements with a delusion which the See of Rome itself had momentarily patronized.
Since the Council of Trent, not a theologian of the Latins has been free from organic heresies,
compared with which the fanaticism of our author was a trifling aberration. Since the late
Council of the Vatican, essential Montanism has become organized in the Latin Churches:
for what are the new revelations and oracles of the pontiff but the deliria of another claimant
to the voice and inspiration of the Paraclete? Poor Tertullian! The sad influences of his decline
and folly have been fatally felt in all the subsequent history of the West, but, surely subscribers
to the Modern Creed of the Vatican have reason to “speak gently of their father’s fall.” To
Döllinger, with the “Old Catholic” remnant only, is left the right to name the Montanists
heretics, or to upbraid Tertullian as a lapser from Catholicity.2</p>
<p>From Dr. Holmes, I append the following Introductory Notice:3</p>
<p>(I.) Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus, as our author is called in the mss. of his
works, is thus noticed by Jerome in his Catalogus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum:4 “Tertullian,
a presbyter, the first Latin writer after Victor and Apollonius, was a native of the province
<note type="footnote">2 The notes of Dr. Holmes were bracketted, and I have been forced to remove this feature, as brackets are
tokens in this edition of the contributions of American editors. The perpetual recurrence of brackets in his
translations has led me to improve the page by parenthetical marks instead, which answer as well and rarely can
be mistaken for the author’s parentheses, while these disfigure the printer’s work much less. I have sometimes
substituted italics for brackets, where an inconsiderable word, like and or for, was bracketted by the translator.
In every case that I have noted, an intelligent reader will readily perceive such instances; but a critic who may
wish to praise, or condemn, should carefully compare the Edinburgh pages with our own. I found them so
painful to the eye and so needlessly annoying to the reader, that I have taken the responsibility of making what
seems to me a very great typographical improvement.</note>

of Africa and city of Carthage, the son of a proconsular centurion: he was a man of a sharp
and vehement temper, flourished under Severus and Antoninus Caracalla, and wrote numerous
works, which (as they are generally known) I think it unnecessary to particularize.
I saw at Concordia, in Italy, an old man named Paulus. He said that when young he had
met at Rome with an aged amanuensis of the blessed Cyprian, who told him that Cyprian
never passed a day without reading some portion of Tertullian’s works, and used frequently
to say, Give me my master, meaning Tertullian. After remaining a presbyter of the church
until he had attained the middle age of life, Tertullian was, by the envy and contumelious
treatment of the Roman clergy, driven to embrace the opinions of Montanus, which he has
mentioned in several of his works under the title of the New Prophecy.…He is reported to
have lived to a very advanced age, and to have composed many other works which are not
extant.” We add Bishop Kaye’s notes on this extract, in an abridged shape: “The correctness
of some parts of this account has been questioned. Doubts have been entertained whether
Tertullian was a presbyter, although these have solely arisen from Roman Catholic objections
to a married priesthood; for it is certain that he was married, there being among his works
two treatises addressed to his wife.…Another question has been raised respecting the place
where Tertullian officiated as a presbyter—whether at Carthage or at Rome. That he at one
time resided at Carthage may be inferred from Jerome’s statement, and is rendered certain
by several passages of his own writings. Allix supposes that the notion of his having been a
presbyter of the Roman Church owed its rise to what Jerome said of the envy and abuse of
the Roman clergy impelling him to espouse the party of Montanus. Optatus,5 and the author
of the work de Hæresibus, which Sirmond edited under the title of Prædestinatus, expressly
call him a Carthaginian presbyter. Semler, however, in a dissertation inserted in his edition
of Tertullian’s works,6 contends that he was a presbyter of the Roman Church. Eusebius7
tells us that he was accurately acquainted with the Roman laws, and on other accounts a
distinguished person at Rome.8 Tertullian displays, moreover, a knowledge of the proceedings
of the Roman Church with respect to Marcion and Valentinus, who were once members of
it, which could scarcely have been obtained by one who had not himself been numbered
amongst its presbyters.9 Semler admits that, after Tertullian seceded from the church, he
left and returned to Carthage. Jerome does not inform us whether Tertullian was born of

<pb n="9"/>
Christian parents, or was converted to Christianity. There are passages in his writings10
which seem to imply that he had been a Gentile; yet he may perhaps mean to describe, not
his own condition, but that of Gentiles in general, before their conversion. Allix and the
majority of commentators understand them literally, as well as some other passages in which
he speaks of his own infirmities and sinfulness. His writings show that he flourished at the
period specified by Jerome—that is, during the reigns of Severus and Antoninus Caracalla,
or between the years a.d. 193 and 216; but they supply no precise information respecting
the date of his birth, or any of the principal occurrences of his life. Allix places his birth
about 145 or 150; his conversion to Christianity about a.d. 185; his marriage about 186; his
admission to the priesthood11 about 192; his adoption of the opinions of Montanus about
199; and his death about a.d. 220. But these dates, it must be understood, rest entirely on
conjecture.”12</p>
<p>(II.) Tertullian’s work against Marcion, as it happens, is, as to its date, the best authenticated—
perhaps the only well authenticated—particular connected with the author’s life.
He himself13 mentions the fifteenth year of the reign of Severus as the time when he was
writing the work: “Ad xv. jam Severi imperatoris.” This agrees with Jerome’s Chronicle,
where occurs this note: “Anno 2223 Severi xvº Tertullianus…celebratur.”14 This year is assigned
to the year of our Lord 207;15 but notwithstanding the certainty of this date, it is far
from clear that it describes more than the time of the publication of the first book. On the
contrary, it is nearly certain that the other books, although connected manifestly enough
in the author’s argument and purpose (compare the initial and the final chapters of the
several books), were yet issued at separate times. Noesselt16 shows that between the Book
i. and Books ii.–iv. Tertullian issued his De Præscript. Hæret., and previous to Book v. he
published his tracts, De Carne Christi and De Resurrectione Carnis. After giving the incontestable
date of the xv. of Severus for the first book, he says it is a mistake to suppose that

<pb n="10"/>
the other books were published with it. He adds: “Although we cannot undertake to determine
whether Tertullian issued his Books ii., iii., iv., against Marcion, together or separately, or
in what year, we yet venture to affirm that Book v. appeared apart from the rest. For the
tract De Resurr. Carnis appears from its second chapter to have been published after the
tract De Carne Christi, in which latter work (chap. vii.) he quotes a passage from the fourth
book against Marcion. But in his Book v. against Marcion (chap. x.), he refers to his work
De Resurr. Carnis; which circumstance makes it evident that Tertullian published his Book
v. at a different time from his Book iv. In his Book i. he announces his intention (chap. i.)
of some time or other completing his tract De Præscript. Hæret., but in his book De Carne
Christi (chap. ii.), he mentions how he had completed it,—a conclusive proof that his Book
i. against Marcion preceded the other books.”</p>
<p>(III.) Respecting Marcion himself, the most formidable heretic who had as yet opposed
revealed truth, enough will turn up in this treatise, with the notes which we have added in
explanation, to satisfy the reader. It will, however, be convenient to give here a few introductory
particulars of him. Tertullian17 mentions Marcion as being, with Valentinus, in
communion with the Church at Rome, “under the episcopate of the blessed Eleutherus.”
He goes on to charge them with “ever-restless curiosity, with which they infected even the
brethren;” and informs us that they were more than once put out of communion—“Marcion,
indeed, with the 200 sesterces which he brought into the church.”18 He goes on to say, that
“being at last condemned to the banishment of a perpetual separation, they sowed abroad
the poisons of their doctrines. Afterwards, when Marcion, having professed penitence,
agreed to the terms offered to him, that he should receive reconciliation on condition that
he brought back to the church the rest also, whom he had trained up for perdition, he was
prevented by death.” He was a native of Sinope in Pontus, of which city, according to an
account preserved by Epiphanius,19 which, however, is somewhat doubtful, his father was
bishop, and of high character both for his orthodoxy and exemplary practice. He came to
Rome soon after the death of Hyginus, probably about a.d. 141 or 142; and soon after his
arrival he adopted the heresy of Cerdon.20</p>
<p>(IV.) It is an interesting question as to what edition of the Holy Scriptures Tertullian
used in his very copious quotations. It may at once be asserted that he did not cite from the
Hebrew, although some writers have claimed for him, among his varied learning, a knowledge
of the sacred language. Bp. Kaye observes, page 61, n. 1, that “he sometimes speaks as if he
was acquainted with Hebrew,” and refers to the Anti-Marcion iv. 39, the Adv. Praxeam v.,

and the Adv. Judæos ix. Be this as it may, it is manifest that Tertullian’s Scripture passages
never resemble the Hebrew, but in nearly every instance the Septuagint, whenever, as is
most frequently the case, that version differs from the original. In the New Testament there
is, as might be expected, a tolerably close conformity to the Greek. There is, however, it
must be allowed, a sufficiently frequent variation from the letter of both the Greek Testaments
to justify Semler’s suspicion that Tertullian always quoted from the old Latin version,21
whatever that might have been, which was current in the African church in the second and
third centuries. The most valuable part of Semler’s Dissertatio de varia et incerta indole
Librorum Q. S. F. Tertulliani is his investigation of this very point. In section iv. he endeavours
to prove this proposition: “Hic scriptor22 non in manibus habuit Græcos libros sacros;” and
he states his conclusion thus: “Certissimum est nec Tertullianum nec Cyprianum nec ullum
scriptorem e Latinis illis ecclesiasticis provocare unquam ad Græcorum librorum auctoritatem
si vel maxime obscura aut contraria lectio occurreret;” and again: “Ex his satis certum
est, Latinos satis diu secutos fuisse auctoritatem suorum librorum adversus Græcos, nec
concessisse nisi serius, cum Augustini et Hieronymi nova auctoritas juvare videretur.” It is
not ignorance of Greek which is imputed to Tertullian, for he is said to have well understood
that language, and even to have composed in it. He probably followed the Latin, as writers
now usually quote the authorized English, as being current and best known among their
readers. Independent feeling, also, would have weight with such a temper as Tertullian’s,
to say nothing of the suspicion which largely prevailed in the African branch of the Latin
church, that the Greek copies of the Scriptures were much corrupted by the heretics, who
were chiefly, if not wholly, Greeks or Greek-speaking persons.</p>
<p>(V.) Whatever perverting effect Tertullian’s secession to the sect of Montanus23 may
have had on his judgment in his latest writings, it did not vitiate the work against Marcion.
With a few trivial exceptions, this treatise may be read by the strictest Catholic without any
feeling of annoyance. His lapse to Montanism is set down conjecturally as having taken

<note type="footnote">23 Vincentius Lirinensis, in his celebrated Commonitorium, expresses the opinion of Catholic churchmen
concerning Tertullian thus: “Tertullian, among the Latins, without controversy, is the chief of all our writers.
For who was more learned than he? Who in divinity or humanity more practised? For, by a certain wonderful
capacity of mind, he attained to and understood all philosophy, all the sects of philosophers, all their founders
and supporters, all their systems, all sorts of histories and studies. And for his wit, was he not so excellent, so
grave, so forcible, that he scarce ever undertook the overthrow of any position, but either by quickness of wit
he undermined, or by weight of reason he crushed it? Further, who is able to express the praises which his style
of speech deserves, which is fraught (I know none like it) with that cogency of reason, that such as it cannot
persuade, it compels to assent; whose so many words almost are so many sentences; whose so many senses, so</note>

place a.d. 199. Jerome, we have seen, attributed the event to his quarrel with the Roman
clergy, but this is at least doubtful; nor must it be forgotten that Tertullian’s mind seems to
have been peculiarly suited by nature24 to adopt the mystical notions and ascetic principles
of Montanus. It is satisfactory to find that, on the whole, “the authority of Tertullian,” as
the learned Dr. Burton says, “upon great points of doctrine is considered to be little, if at
all, affected by his becoming a Montanist.” (Lectures on Eccl. Hist. vol. ii. p. 234.) Besides
the different works which are expressly mentioned in the notes of this volume, recourse has
been had by the translator to Dupin’s Hist. Eccl. Writers (trans.), vol. i. pp. 69–86; Tillemont’s
Mèmoires Hist. Eccl. iii. 85–103; Dr. Smith’s Greek and Roman Biography, articles “Marcion”
and “Tertullian;” Schaff’s article, in Herzog’s Cyclopædia, on “Tertullian;” Munter’s Primordia
Eccl. Africanæ, pp. 118–150; Robertson’s Church Hist. vol. i. pp. 70–77; Dr. P. Schaff’s Hist.
of Christian Church (New York, 1859, pp. 511–519), and Archdeacon Evans’ Biography of
the Early Church, vol. i. (Lives of “Marcion,” pp. 93–122, and “Tertullian,” pp. 325–363).
This last work, though of a popular cast, shows a good deal of research and learning, expressed
in the pleasant style of the once popular author of The Rectory of Vale Head. The
translator has mentioned these works, because they are all quite accessible to the general
reader, and will give him adequate information concerning the subject treated in the present
volume.</p>
<p>To this introduction of Dr. Holmes must be added that of Mr. Thelwall, the translator
of the Third volume in the Edinburgh Series, as follows:</p>
<p>To arrange chronologically the works (especially if numerous) of an author whose own
date is known with tolerable precision, is not always or necessarily easy: witness the controversies
as to the succession of St. Paul’s epistles. To do this in the case of an author whose
own date is itself a matter of controversy may therefore be reasonably expected to be still
less so; and such is the predicament of him who attempts to perform this task for Tertullian.
I propose to give a specimen or two of the difficulties with which the task is beset; and then
to lay before the reader briefly a summary of the results at which eminent scholars, who
<note type="footnote">many victories? This know Marcion and Apelles, Praxeas and Hermogenes, Jews, Gentiles, Gnostics, and divers
others, whose blasphemous opinions he hath overthrown with his many and great volumes, as it had been
thunderbolts. And yet this man after all, this Tertullian, not retaining the Catholic doctrine—that is, the old
faith—hath discredited with his later error his worthy writings,” etc.—Chap. xxiv. (Oxford trans. chap. xviii.)</note>
<note type="footnote">24 Neander’s introduction to his Antignostikus should be read in connection with this topic. He powerfully
delineates the disposition of Tertullian and the character of Montanism, and attributes his secession to that sect
not to outward causes, but to “his internal congeniality of mind.” But, inasmuch as a man’s subjective development
is very much guided by circumstances, it is not necessary, in agreeing with Neander, to disbelieve some
such account as Jerome has given us of Tertullian (Neander’s Antignostikus, etc. Bohn’s trans., vol. ii. pp.
200–207).</note>

<pb n="13"/>
have devoted much time and thought to the subject, have arrived. Such a course, I think,
will at once afford him means of judging of the absolute impossibility of arriving at definite
certainty in the matter; and induce him to excuse me if I prefer furnishing him with materials
from which to deduce his own conclusions, rather than venturing on an ex cathedra
decision on so doubtful a subject.</p>
<p>I. The book, as Dr. Holmes has reminded us,25 of the date of which we seem to have
the surest evidence, is Adv. Marc. i. This book was in course of writing, as its author himself
(c. 15) tells us, “in the fifteenth year of the empire of Severus.” Now this date would be clear
if there were no doubt as to which year of our era corresponds to Tertullian’s fifteenth of
Severus. Pamelius, however, says Dr. Holmes, makes it a.d. 208; Clinton, (whose authority
is more recent and better,) 207.</p>
<p>2. Another book which promises to give some clue to its date is the de Pallio.26 The
writer uses these phrases: “præsentis imperii triplex virtus;” “Deo tot Augustis in unum
favente;” which show that there were at the time three persons unitedly bearing the title
Augusti—not Cæsares only, but the still higher Augusti;—while the remainder of that context,
as well as the opening of c. 1, indicates a time of peace of some considerable duration; a time
of plenty; and a time during and previous to which great changes had taken place in the
general aspect of the Roman Empire, and some particular traitor had been discovered and
frustrated. Such a combination of circumstances might seem to fix the date with some degree
of assurance. But unhappily, as Kaye reminds us,27 commentators cannot agree as to who
the three Augusti are. Some say Severus, Caracalla, and Albinus; some say Severus, Caracalla,
and Geta. Hence we have a difference of some twelve years or thereabouts in the computations.
For Albinus was defeated by Severus in person, and fell by his own hand, in a.d. 197;
and Geta, Severus’ second son, brother of Caracalla, was not associated by his father with
himself and his other son as Augustus until a.d. 208, though he had received the title of
Cæsar ten years before, in the same year in which Caracalla had received that of Augustus.28
For my own part, I may perhaps be allowed to say that I should incline to agree, like Salmasius,
with those who assign the later date. The limits of the present Introduction forbid my
entering at large into my reasons for so doing. I am, however, supported in it by the authority
of Neander.29 In one point, though, I should hesitate to agree with Oehler, who appears to
follow Salmasius and others herein,—namely, in understanding the expression “et cacto et
rubo subdolæ familiaritatis convulso” of Albinus. It seems to me the words might with more

propriety be applied to Plautianus; and that in the word “familiaritatis” we may see (after
Tertullian’s fashion) a play upon the meaning, with a reference not only to the long-standing
but mischievous intimacy which existed between Severus and his countryman (perhaps
fellow-townsman) Plautianus, who for his harshness and cruelty is fitly compared to the
prickly cactus. He alludes likewise to the alliance which this ambitious prætorian præfect
had contrived to contract with the family of the emperor, by the marriage of his daughter
Plautilla to Caracalla,—an event which, as it turned out, led to his own death. Thus in the
“rubo” there may be a reference to the ambitious and conceited “bramble” of Jotham’s parable,
30 and perhaps, too, to the “thistle” of Jehoash’s.31 If this be so, the date would be at
least approximately fixed, as Plautianus did not marry his daughter to Caracalla till a.d. 203,
and was himself put to death in the following year, 204, while Geta, as we have seen, was
made Augustus in 208.</p>
<p>3. The date of the Apology, however, is perhaps at once the most contested, and the most
strikingly illustrative of the difficulties to which allusion has been made. It is not surprising
that its date should have been more disputed than that of other pieces, inasmuch as it is the
best known, and (for some reasons) the most interesting and famous, of all our author’s
productions. In fact, the dates assigned to it by different authorities vary from Mosheim’s
198 to that suggested by the very learned Allix, who assigns it to 217.32</p>
<p>4. Once more. In the tract de Monogamia (c. 3) the author says that since the date of
St. Paul’s first Epistle to the Corinthians “about 160 years had elapsed.” Here, again, did we
only know with certainty the precise date of that epistle, we could ascertain “about” the date
of the tract. But (a) the date of the epistle is itself variously given, Burton giving it as early
as a.d. 52, Michaelis and Mill as late as 57; and (b) Tertullian only says, “Armis circiter clx.
exinde productis;” while the way in which, in the ad Natt., within the short space of three
chapters, he states first33 that 250, and then (in c. 9) that 300, years had not elapsed since
the rise of the Christian name, leads us to think that here again34 he only desires to speak
in round numbers, meaning perhaps more than 150, but less than 170.</p>
<note type="footnote">30 See Judg. ix. 2 sqq.</note>
<note type="footnote">31 See 2 Kings (4 Kings in LXX. and Vulg.) xiv. 9.
32 Here, again, our limits forbid a discussion; but the allusion to the Rhone having “scarcely yet lost the stain
of blood” which we find in the ad. Natt. i. 17, compared with Apol. 35, seems to favour the idea of those who
date the ad. Natt. earlier than the Apology, and consider the latter as a kind of new edition of the former: while
it would fix the date of the ad. Natt. as not certainly earlier than 197, in which year (as we have seen) Albinus
died. The fatal battle took place on the banks of the Rhone.</note>

<p>These specimens must suffice, though it might be easy to add to them. There is, however,
another classification of our author’s writings which has been attempted. Finding the haplessness
of strict chronological accuracy, commentators have seized on the idea that peradventure
there might be found at all events some internal marks by which to determine which
of them were written before, which after, the writer’s secession to Montanism. It may be
confessed that this attempt has been somewhat more successful than the other. Yet even
here there are two formidable obstacles standing in our way. The first and greatest is, that
the natural temper of Tertullian was from the first so akin to the spirit of Montanism, that,
unless there occur distinct allusions to the “New Prophecy,” or expressions specially connected
with Montanistic phraseology, the general tone of any treatise is not a very safe guide.
The second is, that the subject-matter of some of the treatises is not such as to afford much
scope for the introduction of the peculiarities of a sect which professed to differ in discipline
only, not doctrine, from the church at large.</p>
<p>Still the result of this classification seems to show one important feature of agreement
between commentators, however they may differ upon details; and that is, that considerably
the larger part of our author’s rather voluminous productions35 must have been subsequent
to his lamented secession. I think the best way to give the reader means for forming his own
judgment will be, as I have said, to lay before him in parallel columns a tabular view of the
disposition of the books by Dr. Neander and Bishop Kaye. These two modern writers, having
given particular care to the subject, bringing to bear upon it all the advantages derived from
wide reading, eminent abilities, and a diligent study of the works of preceding writers on
the same questions,36 have a special right to be heard upon the matter in hand; and I think,
if I may be allowed to say so, that, for calm judgment, and minute acquaintance with his
author, I shall not be accused of undue partiality if I express my opinion that, as far as my
own observation goes, the palm must be awarded to the Bishop. In this view I am supported
by the fact that the accomplished Professor Ramsay,37 follows Dr. Kaye’s arrangement. I
premise that Dr. Neander adopts a threefold division, into:</p>
<p>1. Writings which were occasioned by the relation of the Christians to the heathen, and
refer to their vindication of Christianity against the heathen; attacks on heathenism; the
sufferings and conduct of Christians under persecution; and the intercourse of Christians
with heathens:</p>
<p>2. Writings which relate to Christian and church life, and to ecclesiastical discipline:</p>
<p>3. The dogmatic and dogmatico-controversial treatises.</p>
<note type="footnote">35 It looks strange to see Tertullian’s works referred to as consisting of “about thirty short treatises” in Murdock’s
note on Moshiem. See the ed. of the Eccl. Hist. by Dr. J. Seaton Reid, p. 65, n. 2, Lond. and Bel. 1852.</note>
<note type="footnote">36 This last qualification is very specially observable in Dr. Kaye.</note>
<note type="footnote">37 In his article on Tertullian in Smith’s Dict. of Biog. and Myth.</note>

<pb n="16"/>
<p>And under each head he subdivides into:</p>
<p>a. Pre-Montanist writings; b. Post-Montanist writings:</p>
<p>thus leaving no room for what Kaye calls “works respecting which nothing certain can
be pronounced.” For the sake of clearness, this order has not been followed in the table. On
the other side, it will be seen that Dr. Kaye, while not assuming to speak with more than a
reasonable probability, is careful so to arrange the treatises under each head as to show the
order, so far as it is discoverable, in which the books under that head were published; i.e.,
if one book is quoted in another book, the book so quoted, if distinctly referred to as already
before the world, is plainly anterior to that in which it is quoted. Thus, then, have:</p>

<note type="footnote">48 Archdeacon Evans, in his Biography of the Early Church (in the Theological Library), suggests that the
success which the Apology met with, or at least the fame it brought its author, may have been the occasion of
Tertullian’s visit to Rome. He rejects entirely the supposition that Tertullian was a presbyter of the Roman
church; nor does he think Eusebius’ words, καὶ τῶν μάλιστα ἐπὶ ῾Ρώμης λαμπρῶν (Eccl. Hist. ii. 2. 47 ad fin.,
48 ad init.), sufficiently plain to be relied on. One thing does seem pretty plain, that the rendering of them which
Rufinus gives, and Valesius follows, “inter nostros” (sc. Latinos) “Scriptores admodum clarus,” cannot be correct.
That we find a famous Roman lawyer Tertullianus, or Tertyllianus, among the writers fragments of whom are
preserved in the Pandects, Neander reminds us; but (as he says) it by no means follows, even if it could be proved
that the date of the said lawyer corresponded with the supposed date of our Tertullian, that they were identical.
Still it is worth bearing in mind, especially as a similarity of language exists, or has been thought to exist, between
the jurist and the Christian author. And the juridical language and tone of our author do seem to point to his
having—though Mr. Evans regards that as doubtful—been a trained lawyer.—Tr.</note>

<p>A comparison of these two lists will show that the difference between the two great authorities
is, as Kaye remarks, “not great; and with respect to some of the tracts on which we
differ, the learned author expresses himself with great diffidence.”49 The main difference,
in fact, is that which affects two tracts upon kindred subjects, the de Spectaculis, and Idololatria,
the de Cultu Feminarum (a subject akin to the other two), and the adv. Judæos. With
reference to all these, except the last, to which I believe the Archdeacon does not once refer,
the Bishop’s opinion appears to have the support of Archdeacon Evans, whose learned and
interesting essay, referred to in the note, appears in a volume published in 1837. Dr. Kaye’s
Lectures, on which his book is founded, were delivered in 1825. Of the date of his first edition
I am not aware. Dr. Neander’s Antignostikus also first appeared in 1825. The preface to his
second edition bears date July 1, 184950. As to the adv. Judæos, I confess I agree with Neander
in thinking that, at all events from the beginning of c. 9, it is spurious. If it be urged that
Jerome expressly quotes it as Tertullian’s, I reply, Jerome so quotes it, I believe, when he is
expounding Daniel. Now all that the adv. Jud. has to say about Daniel ends with the end of
c. 8. It is therefore quite compatible with the fact thus stated to recognize the earlier half of
the book as genuine, and to reject the rest, beginning, as it happens, just after the eighth
chapter, as spurious. Perhaps Dr. Neander’s Jewish birth and training peculiarly fit him to
be heard on this question. Nor do I think Professor Ramsay (in the article above alluded to)
has quite seen the force of Kaye’s own remarks on Neander.51 What he does say is equally
creditable to his candour and his accuracy; namely: “The instances alleged by Dr. Neander,
in proof of this position, are undoubtedly very remarkable; but if the concluding chapters
of the tract are spurious, no ground seems to be left for asserting that the genuine portion
was posterior to the third Book against Marcion,52—and none, consequently, for asserting
that it was written by a Montanist.” With which remark I must draw these observations on
the genuine extant works of Tertullian to a close.</p>

states that there was extant, or had been extant, a book on Fate under the name of Minucius
Felix, written indeed by a perspicuous author, but not in the style of Minucius Felix. This,
Pamelius judged, should perhaps be rather ascribed to Tertullian.</p>
<p>11. A Book on the Trinity. Jerome64 says: “Novatian wrote.…a large volume on the
Trinity, as if making an epitome of a work of Tertullian’s, which most men not knowing regard
it as Cyprian’s.” Novatian’s book stood in Tertullian’s name in the mss. of J. Gangneius,
who was the first to edit it; in a Malmesbury ms. which Sig. Gelenius used; and in others.</p>
<p>12. A Book addressed to a Philosophic Friend on the Straits of Matrimony. Both Kaye
and Oehler65 are in doubt whether Jerome’s words,66 by which some have been led to conclude
that Tertullian wrote some book or books on this and kindred subjects, really imply
as much, or whether they may not refer merely to those tracts and passages in his extant
writings which touch upon such matters. Kaye hesitates to think that the “Book to a Philosophic
Friend” is the same as the de Exhortatione Castitatis, because Jerome says Tertullian
wrote on the subject of celibacy “in his youth;” but as Cave takes what Jerome elsewhere
says of Tertullian’s leaving the Church “about the middle of his age” to mean his spiritual
age, the same sense might attach to his words here too, and thus obviate the Bishop’s difficulty.</p>
<p>There are some other works which have been attributed to Tertullian—on Circumcision;
on Animals Clean and Unclean; on the truth that God is a Judge—which Oehler likewise
rejects, believing that the expressions of Jerome refer only to passages in the Anti-Marcion
and other extant works. To Novatian Jerome does ascribe a distinct work on Circumcision,67
and this may (comp. 11, just above) have given rise to the view that Tertullian had written
one also.</p>
<p>There were, moreover, three treatises at least written by Tertullian in Greek. They are:</p>
<p>1. A Book on Public Shows. See de Cor. c. 6.</p>
<p>2. A Book on Baptism. See de Bapt. c. 15.</p>
<p>3. A Book on the Veiling of Virgins. See de V. V. c. 1.</p>
<p>Oehler adds that J. Pamelius, in his epistle dedicatory to Philip II. of Spain, makes
mention of a Greek copy of Tertullian in the library of that king. This report, however, since
nothing has ever been seen or heard of the said copy from that time, Oehler judges to be
erroneous.68</p>

<pb n="22"/>
<p>It remains briefly to notice the confessedly spurious works which the editions of Tertullian
generally have appended to them. With these Kaye does not deal. The fragment, adv.
omnes Hæreses, Oehler attributes to Victorinus Petavionensis, i.e., Victorinus bishop of
Pettaw, on the Drave, in Austrian Styria. It was once thought he ought to be called Pictaviensis,
i.e. of Poictiers; but John Launoy69 has shown this to be an error. Victorinus is said
by Jerome to have “understood Greek better than Latin; hence his works are excellent for
the sense, but mean as to the style.”70 Cave believes him to have been a Greek by birth.
Cassiodorus71 states him to have been once a professor of rhetoric. Jerome’s statement
agrees with the style of the tract in question; and Jerome distinctly says Victorinus did write
adversus omnes Hæreses. Allix leaves the question of its authorship quite uncertain. If Victorinus
be the author, the book falls clearly within the Ante-Nicene period; for Victorinus
fell a martyr in the Diocletian persecution, probably about a.d. 303.</p>
<p>The next fragment—“Of the Execrable Gods of the Heathens”—is of quite uncertain
authorship. Oehler would attribute it “to some declaimer not quite ignorant of Tertullian’s
writings,” but certainly not to Tertullian himself.</p>
<p>Lastly we come to the metrical fragments. Concerning these, it is perhaps impossible
to assign them to their rightful owners. Oehler has not troubled himself much about them;
but he seems to regard the Jonah as worthy of more regard than the rest, for he seems to
have intended giving more labour to its editing at some future time. Whether he has ever
done so, or given us his German version of Tertullian’s own works, which, “si Deus adjuverit,”
he distinctly promises in his preface, I do not know. Perhaps the best thing to be done
under the circumstances is to give the judgment of the learned Peter Allix. It may be premised
that by the celebrated George Fabricius72—who published his great work, Poetarum Veterum
Ecclesiasticorum Opera Christiana, etc., in 1564—the Five Books in Reply to Marcion, and
the Judgment of the Lord, are ascribed to Tertullian, the Genesis and Sodom to Cyprian.
Pamelius likewise seems to have ascribed the Five Books, the Jonah, and the Sodom73 to
Tertullian; and according to Lardner, Bishop Bull likewise attributed the Five Books to him.74
They have been generally ascribed to the Victorinus above mentioned. Tillemont, among
others, thinks they may well enough be his.75 Rigaltius is content to demonstrate that they

are not Tertullian’s, but leaves the real authorship without attempting to decide it. Of the
others the same eminent critic says, “They seem to have been written at Carthage, at an age
not far removed from Tertullian’s.”76 Allix, after observing that Pamelius is inconsistent
with himself in attributing the Genesis and Sodom at one time to Tertullian, at another to
Cyprian, rejects both views equally, and assigns the Genesis with some confidence to Salvian,
a presbyter of Marseilles, whose “floruit” Cave gives cir. 440, a contemporary of Gennadius,
and a copious author. To this it is, Allix thinks, that Gennadius alludes in his Catalogue of
Illustrious Men, c. 77.</p>
<p>The Judgment of the Lord Allix ascribes to one Verecundus, an African bishop, whose
date he finds it difficult to decide exactly. He refers to two of the name: one Bishop of Tunis,
whom Victor of Tunis in his chronicle mentions as having died in exile at Chalcedon a.d.
552; the other Bishop of Noba, who visited Carthage with many others a.d. 482, at the
summons of King Huneric, to answer there for their faith;—and would ascribe the poem
to the former, thinking that he finds an allusion to it in the article upon that Verecundus in
the de Viris Illustribus of Isidore of Seville. Oehler agrees with him. The Five Books Allix
seems to hint may be attributed to some imitator of the Victorinus of Pettaw named above.
Oehler attributes them rather to one Victorinus, or Victor, of Marseilles, a rhetorician, who
died a.d. 450. He appears in G. Fabricius as Claudius Marius Victorinus, writer of a Commentary
on Genesis, and an epistle ad Salomonem Abbata, both in verse, and of some considerable
length.</p>

<p>Rulers of the Roman Empire, if, seated for the administration of justice on your lofty
tribunal, under the gaze of every eye, and occupying there all but the highest position in the
state, you may not openly inquire into and sift before the world the real truth in regard to
the charges made against the Christians; if in this case alone you are afraid or ashamed to
exercise your authority in making public inquiry with the carefulness which becomes justice;
if, finally, the extreme severities inflicted on our people in recently private judgments, stand
in the way of our being permitted to defend ourselves before you, you cannot surely forbid
the Truth to reach your ears by the secret pathway of a noiseless book.78 She has no appeals
to make to you in regard of her condition, for that does not excite her wonder. She knows
that she is but a sojourner on the earth, and that among strangers she naturally finds foes;
and more than this, that her origin, her dwelling-place, her hope, her recompense, her
honours, are above. One thing, meanwhile, she anxiously desires of earthly rulers—not to
be condemned unknown. What harm can it do to the laws, supreme in their domain, to
give her a hearing? Nay, for that part of it, will not their absolute supremacy be more conspicuous
in their condemning her, even after she has made her plea? But if, unheard, sentence
is pronounced against her, besides the odium of an unjust deed, you will incur the merited
suspicion of doing it with some idea that it is unjust, as not wishing to hear what you may
not be able to hear and condemn. We lay this before you as the first ground on which we
urge that your hatred to the name of Christian is unjust. And the very reason which seems
to excuse this injustice (I mean ignorance) at once aggravates and convicts it. For what is
there more unfair than to hate a thing of which you know nothing, even though it deserve
to be hated? Hatred is only merited when it is known to be merited. But without that

knowledge, whence is its justice to be vindicated? for that is to be proved, not from the mere
fact that an aversion exists, but from acquaintance with the subject. When men, then, give
way to a dislike simply because they are entirely ignorant of the nature of the thing disliked,
why may it not be precisely the very sort of thing they should not dislike? So we maintain
that they are both ignorant while they hate us, and hate us unrighteously while they continue
in ignorance, the one thing being the result of the other either way of it. The proof of their
ignorance, at once condemning and excusing their injustice, is this, that those who once
hated Christianity because they knew nothing about it, no sooner come to know it than they
all lay down at once their enmity. From being its haters they become its disciples. By simply
getting acquainted with it, they begin now to hate what they had formerly been, and to
profess what they had formerly hated; and their numbers are as great as are laid to our
charge. The outcry is that the State is filled with Christians—that they are in the fields, in
the citadels, in the islands: they make lamentation, as for some calamity, that both sexes,
every age and condition, even high rank, are passing over to the profession of the Christian
faith; and yet for all, their minds are not awakened to the thought of some good they have
failed to notice in it. They must not allow any truer suspicions to cross their minds; they
have no desire to make closer trial. Here alone the curiosity of human nature slumbers.
They like to be ignorant, though to others the knowledge has been bliss. Anacharsis reproved
the rude venturing to criticise the cultured; how much more this judging of those who know,
by men who are entirely ignorant, might he have denounced! Because they already dislike,
they want to know no more. Thus they prejudge that of which they are ignorant to be such,
that, if they came to know it, it could no longer be the object of their aversion; since, if inquiry
finds nothing worthy of dislike, it is certainly proper to cease from an unjust dislike, while
if its bad character comes plainly out, instead of the detestation entertained for it being thus
diminished, a stronger reason for perseverance in that detestation is obtained, even under
the authority of justice itself. But, says one, a thing is not good merely because multitudes
go over to it; for how many have the bent of their nature towards whatever is bad! how many
go astray into ways of error! It is undoubted. Yet a thing that is thoroughly evil, not even
those whom it carries away venture to defend as good. Nature throws a veil either of fear
or shame over all evil. For instance, you find that criminals are eager to conceal themselves,
avoid appearing in public, are in trepidation when they are caught, deny their guilt, when
they are accused; even when they are put to the rack, they do not easily or always confess;
when there is no doubt about their condemnation, they grieve for what they have done. In
their self-communings they admit their being impelled by sinful dispositions, but they lay
the blame either on fate or on the stars. They are unwilling to acknowledge that the thing
is theirs, because they own that it is wicked. But what is there like this in the Christian’s
case? The only shame or regret he feels, is at not having been a Christian earlier. If he is
pointed out, he glories in it; if he is accused, he offers no defence; interrogated, he makes

<pb n="26"/>
voluntary confession; condemned he renders thanks. What sort of evil thing is this, which
wants all the ordinary peculiarities of evil—fear, shame, subterfuge, penitence, lamenting?
What! is that a crime in which the criminal rejoices? to be accused of which is his ardent
wish, to be punished for which is his felicity? You cannot call it madness, you who stand
convicted of knowing nothing of the matter.</p>

<p>If, again, it is certain that we are the most wicked of men, why do you treat us so differently
from our fellows, that is, from other criminals, it being only fair that the same crime
should get the same treatment? When the charges made against us are made against others,
they are permitted to make use both of their own lips and of hired pleaders to show their
innocence. They have full opportunity of answer and debate; in fact, it is against the law to
condemn anybody undefended and unheard. Christians alone are forbidden to say anything
in exculpation of themselves, in defence of the truth, to help the judge to a righteous decision;
all that is cared about is having what the public hatred demands—the confession of the
name, not examination of the charge: while in your ordinary judicial investigations, on a
man’s confession of the crime of murder, or sacrilege, or incest, or treason, to take the points
of which we are accused, you are not content to proceed at once to sentence,—you do not
take that step till you thoroughly examine the circumstances of the confession—what is the
real character of the deed, how often, where, in what way, when he has done it, who were
privy to it, and who actually took part with him in it. Nothing like this is done in our case,
though the falsehoods disseminated about us ought to have the same sifting, that it might
be found how many murdered children each of us had tasted; how many incests each of us
had shrouded in darkness; what cooks, what dogs had been witness of our deeds. Oh, how
great the glory of the ruler who should bring to light some Christian who had devoured a
hundred infants! But, instead of that, we find that even inquiry in regard to our case is forbidden.
For the younger Pliny, when he was ruler of a province, having condemned some
Christians to death, and driven some from their stedfastness, being still annoyed by their
great numbers, at last sought the advice of Trajan,79 the reigning emperor, as to what he
was to do with the rest, explaining to his master that, except an obstinate disinclination to
offer sacrifices, he found in the religious services nothing but meetings at early morning for
singing hymns to Christ and80 God, and sealing home their way of life by a united pledge
to be faithful to their religion, forbidding murder, adultery, dishonesty, and other crimes.
Upon this Trajan wrote back that Christians were by no means to be sought after; but if
they were brought before him, they should be punished. O miserable deliverance,—under
the necessities of the case, a self-contradiction! It forbids them to be sought after as innocent,
and it commands them to be punished as guilty. It is at once merciful and cruel; it passes
by, and it punishes. Why dost thou play a game of evasion upon thyself, O Judgment? If
thou condemnest, why dost thou not also inquire. If thou does not inquire, why dost thou
not also absolve? Military stations are distributed through all the provinces for tracking

robbers. Against traitors and public foes every man is a soldier; search is made even for their
confederates and accessories. The Christian alone must not be sought, though he may be
brought and accused before the judge; as if a search had any other end than that in view!
And so you condemn the man for whom nobody wished a search to be made when he is
presented to you, and who even now does not deserve punishment, I suppose, because of
his guilt, but because, though forbidden to be sought, he was found. And then, too, you do
not in that case deal with us in the ordinary way of judicial proceedings against offenders;
for, in the case of others denying, you apply the torture to make them confess—Christians
alone you torture, to make them deny; whereas, if we were guilty of any crime, we should
be sure to deny it, and you with your tortures would force us to confession. Nor indeed
should you hold that our crimes require no such investigation merely on the ground that
you are convinced by our confession of the name that the deeds were done,—you who are
daily wont, though you know well enough what murder is, none the less to extract from the
confessed murderer a full account of how the crime was perpetrated. So that with all the
greater perversity you act, when, holding our crimes proved by our confession of the name
of Christ, you drive us by torture to fall from our confession, that, repudiating the name,
we may in like manner repudiate also the crimes with which, from that same confession,
you had assumed that we were chargeable. I suppose, though you believe us to be the worst
of mankind, you do not wish us to perish. For thus, no doubt, you are in the habit of bidding
the murderer deny, and of ordering the man guilty of sacrilege to the rack if he persevere
in his acknowledgment! Is that the way of it? But if thus you do not deal with us as criminals,
you declare us thereby innocent, when as innocent you are anxious that we do not persevere
in a confession which you know will bring on us a condemnation of necessity, not of justice,
at your hands. “I am a Christian,” the man cries out. He tells you what he is; you wish to
hear from him what he is not. Occupying your place of authority to extort the truth, you
do your utmost to get lies from us. “I am,” he says, “that which you ask me if I am. Why do
you torture me to sin? I confess, and you put me to the rack. What would you do if I denied?
Certainly you give no ready credence to others when they deny. When we deny, you believe
at once. Let this perversity of yours lead you to suspect that there is some hidden power in
the case under whose influence you act against the forms, against the nature of public justice,
even against the very laws themselves. For, unless I am greatly mistaken, the laws enjoin
offenders to be searched out, and not to be hidden away. They lay it down that persons who
own a crime are to be condemned, not acquitted. The decrees of the senate, the commands
of your chiefs, lay this clearly down. The power of which you are servants is a civil, not a
tyrannical domination. Among tyrants, indeed, torments used to be inflicted even as punishments:
with you they are mitigated to a means of questioning alone. Keep to your law in
these as necessary till confession is obtained; and if the torture is anticipated by confession,
there will be no occasion for it: sentence should be passed; the criminal should be given over

<pb n="29"/>
to the penalty which is his due, not released. Accordingly, no one is eager for the acquittal
of the guilty; it is not right to desire that, and so no one is ever compelled to deny. Well, you
think the Christian a man of every crime, an enemy of the gods, of the emperor, of the laws,
of good morals, of all nature; yet you compel him to deny, that you may acquit him, which
without him denial you could not do. You play fast and loose with the laws. You wish him
to deny his guilt, that you may, even against his will, bring him out blameless and free from
all guilt in reference to the past! Whence is this strange perversity on your part? How is it
you do not reflect that a spontaneous confession is greatly more worthy of credit than a
compelled denial; or consider whether, when compelled to deny, a man’s denial may not
be in good faith, and whether acquitted, he may not, then and there, as soon as the trial is
over, laugh at your hostility, a Christian as much as ever? Seeing, then, that in everything
you deal differently with us than with other criminals, bent upon the one object of taking
from us our name (indeed, it is ours no more if we do what Christians never do), it is made
perfectly clear that there is no crime of any kind in the case, but merely a name which a
certain system, ever working against the truth, pursues with its enmity, doing this chiefly
with the object of securing that men may have no desire to know for certain what they know
for certain they are entirely ignorant of. Hence, too, it is that they believe about us things
of which they have no proof, and they are disinclined to have them looked into, lest the
charges, they would rather take on trust, are all proved to have no foundation, that the name
so hostile to that rival power—its crimes presumed, not proved—may be condemned simply
on its own confession. So we are put to the torture if we confess, and we are punished if we
persevere, and if we deny we are acquitted, because all the contention is about a name. Finally,
why do you read out of your tablet-lists that such a man is a Christian? Why not also that
he is a murderer? And if a Christian is a murderer, why not guilty, too, of incest, or any
other vile thing you believe of us? In our case alone you are either ashamed or unwilling to
mention the very names of our crimes—If to be called a “Christian” does not imply any
crime, the name is surely very hateful, when that of itself is made a crime.</p>

<head>Chapter III.</head>
<p>What are we to think of it, that most people so blindly knock their heads against the
hatred of the Christian name; that when they bear favourable testimony to any one, they
mingle with it abuse of the name he bears? “A good man,” says one, “is Gaius Seius, only
that he is a Christian.” So another, “I am astonished that a wise man like Lucius should have
suddenly become a Christian.” Nobody thinks it needful to consider whether Gaius is not
good and Lucius wise, on this very account that he is a Christian; or a Christian, for the
reason that he is wise and good. They praise what they know, they abuse what they are ignorant
of, and they inspire their knowledge with their ignorance; though in fairness you
should rather judge of what is unknown from what is known, than what is known from
what is unknown. Others, in the case of persons whom, before they took the name of
Christian, they had known as loose, and vile, and wicked, put on them a brand from the
very thing which they praise. In the blindness of their hatred, they fall foul of their own
approving judgment! “What a woman she was! how wanton! how gay! What a youth he
was! how profligate! how libidinous!—they have become Christians!” So the hated name is
given to a reformation of character. Some even barter away their comforts for that hatred,
content to bear injury, if they are kept free at home from the object of their bitter enmity.
The wife, now chaste, the husband, now no longer jealous, casts out of his house; the son,
now obedient, the father, who used to be so patient, disinherits; the servant, now faithful,
the master, once so mild, commands away from his presence; it is a high offence for any
one to be reformed by the detested name. Goodness is of less value than hatred of Christians.
Well now, if there is this dislike of the name, what blame can you attach to names? What
accusation can you bring against mere designations, save that something in the word sounds
either barbarous, or unlucky, or scurrilous, or unchaste? But Christian, so far as the meaning
of the word is concerned, is derived from anointing. Yes, and even when it is wrongly pronounced
by you “Chrestianus” (for you do not even know accurately the name you hate),
it comes from sweetness and benignity. You hate, therefore, in the guiltless, even a guiltless
name. But the special ground of dislike to the sect is, that it bears the name of its Founder.
Is there anything new in a religious sect getting for its followers a designation from its
master? Are not the philosophers called from the founders of their systems—Platonists,
Epicureans, Pythagoreans? Are not the Stoics and Academics so called also from the places
in which they assembled and stationed themselves? and are not physicians named from
Erasistratus, grammarians from Aristarchus, cooks even from Apicius? And yet the bearing
of the name, transmitted from the original institutor with whatever he has instituted, offends
no one. No doubt, if it is proved that the sect is a bad one, and so its founder bad as well,
that will prove that the name is bad and deserves our aversion, in respect of the character
both of the sect and its author. Before, therefore, taking up a dislike to the name, it behoved
you to consider the sect in the author, or the author in the sect. But now, without any sifting

<pb n="31"/>
and knowledge of either, the mere name is made matter of accusation, the mere name is
assailed, and a sound alone brings condemnation on a sect and its author both, while of
both you are ignorant, because they have such and such a designation, not because they are
convicted of anything wrong.</p>

<p>And so, having made these remarks as it were by way of preface, that I might show in
its true colours the injustice of the public hatred against us, I shall now take my stand on
the plea of our blamelessness; and I shall not only refute the things which are objected to
us, but I shall also retort them on the objectors, that in this way all may know that Christians
are free from the very crimes they are so well aware prevail among themselves, that they
may at the same time be put to the blush for their accusations against us,—accusations I
shall not say of the worst of men against the best, but now, as they will have it, against those
who are only their fellows in sin. We shall reply to the accusation of all the various crimes
we are said to be guilty of in secret, such as we find them committing in the light of day,
and as being guilty of which we are held to be wicked, senseless, worthy of punishment,
deserving of ridicule. But since, when our truth meets you successfully at all points, the authority
of the laws as a last resort is set up against it, so that it is either said that their determinations
are absolutely conclusive, or the necessity of obedience is, however unwillingly,
preferred to the truth, I shall first, in this matter of the laws grapple with you as with their
chosen protectors. Now first, when you sternly lay it down in your sentences, “It is not
lawful for you to exist,” and with unhesitating rigour you enjoin this to be carried out, you
exhibit the violence and unjust domination of mere tyranny, if you deny the thing to be
lawful, simply on the ground that you wish it to be unlawful, not because it ought to be. But
if you would have it unlawful because it ought not to be lawful, without doubt that should
have no permission of law which does harm; and on this ground, in fact, it is already determined
that whatever is beneficial is legitimate. Well, if I have found what your law prohibits
to be good, as one who has arrived at such a previous opinion, has it not lost its power to
debar me from it, though that very thing, if it were evil, it would justly forbid to me? If your
law has gone wrong, it is of human origin, I think; it has not fallen from heaven. Is it wonderful
that man should err in making a law, or come to his senses in rejecting it? Did not
the Lacedæmonians amend the laws of Lycurgus himself, thereby inflicting such pain on
their author that he shut himself up, and doomed himself to death by starvation? Are you
not yourselves every day, in your efforts to illumine the darkness of antiquity, cutting and
hewing with the new axes of imperial rescripts and edicts, that whole ancient and rugged
forest of your laws? Has not Severus, that most resolute of rulers, but yesterday repealed the
ridiculous Papian laws81 which compelled people to have children before the Julian laws
allow matrimony to be contracted, and that though they have the authority of age upon
their side? There were laws, too, in old times, that parties against whom a decision had been
given might be cut in pieces by their creditors; however, by common consent that cruelty

was afterwards erased from the statutes, and the capital penalty turned into a brand of shame.
By adopting the plan of confiscating a debtor’s goods, it was sought rather to pour the blood
in blushes over his face than to pour it out. How many laws lie hidden out of sight which
still require to be reformed! For it is neither the number of their years nor the dignity of
their maker that commends them, but simply that they are just; and therefore, when their
injustice is recognized, they are deservedly condemned, even though they condemn. Why
speak we of them as unjust? nay, if they punish mere names, we may well call them irrational.
But if they punish acts, why in our case do they punish acts solely on the ground of a name,
while in others they must have them proved not from the name, but from the wrong done?
I am a practiser of incest (so they say); why do they not inquire into it? I am an infant-killer;
why do they not apply the torture to get from me the truth? I am guilty of crimes against
the gods, against the Cæsars; why am I, who am able to clear myself, not allowed to be heard
on my own behalf? No law forbids the sifting of the crimes which it prohibits, for a judge
never inflicts a righteous vengeance if he is not well assured that a crime has been committed;
nor does a citizen render a true subjection to the law, if he does not know the nature of the
thing on which the punishment is inflicted. It is not enough that a law is just, nor that the
judge should be convinced of its justice; those from whom obedience is expected should
have that conviction too. Nay, a law lies under strong suspicions which does not care to
have itself tried and approved: it is a positively wicked law, if, unproved, it tyrannizes over
men.</p>

<p>To say a word about the origin of laws of the kind to which we now refer, there was an
old decree that no god should be consecrated by the emperor till first approved by the senate.
Marcus Æmilius had experience of this in reference to his god Alburnus. And this, too,
makes for our case, that among you divinity is allotted at the judgment of human beings.
Unless gods give satisfaction to men, there will be no deification for them: the god will have
to propitiate the man. Tiberius82 accordingly, in whose days the Christian name made its
entry into the world, having himself received intelligence from Palestine of events which
had clearly shown the truth of Christ’s divinity, brought the matter before the senate, with
his own decision in favour of Christ. The senate, because it had not given the approval itself,
rejected his proposal. Cæsar held to his opinion, threatening wrath against all accusers of
the Christians. Consult your histories; you will there find that Nero was the first who assailed
with the imperial sword the Christian sect, making progress then especially at Rome. But
we glory in having our condemnation hallowed by the hostility of such a wretch. For any
one who knows him, can understand that not except as being of singular excellence did
anything bring on it Nero’s condemnation. Domitian, too, a man of Nero’s type in cruelty,
tried his hand at persecution; but as he had something of the human in him, he soon put
an end to what he had begun, even restoring again those whom he had banished. Such as
these have always been our persecutors,—men unjust, impious, base, of whom even you
yourselves have no good to say, the sufferers under whose sentences you have been wont
to restore. But among so many princes from that time to the present day, with anything of
divine and human wisdom in them, point out a single persecutor of the Christian name.
So far from that, we, on the contrary, bring before you one who was their protector, as you
will see by examining the letters of Marcus Aurelius, that most grave of emperors, in which
he bears his testimony that that Germanic drought was removed by the rains obtained
through the prayers of the Christians who chanced to be fighting under him. And as he did
not by public law remove from Christians their legal disabilities, yet in another way he put
them openly aside, even adding a sentence of condemnation, and that of greater severity,
against their accusers. What sort of laws are these which the impious alone execute against
us—and the unjust, the vile, the bloody, the senseless, the insane? which Trajan to some
extent made naught by forbidding Christians to be sought after; which neither a Hadrian,
though fond of searching into all things strange and new, nor a Vespasian, though the subjugator
of the Jews, nor a Pius, nor a Verus, ever enforced? It should surely be judged more
natural for bad men to be eradicated by good princes as being their natural enemies, than
by those of a spirit kindred with their own.</p>

<p>I would now have these most religious protectors and vindicators of the laws and institutions
of their fathers, tell me, in regard to their own fidelity and the honour, and submission
they themselves show to ancestral institutions, if they have departed from nothing—if they
have in nothing gone out of the old paths—if they have not put aside whatsoever is most
useful and necessary as rules of a virtuous life. What has become of the laws repressing expensive
and ostentatious ways of living? which forbade more than a hundred asses to be
expended on a supper, and more than one fowl to be set on the table at a time, and that not
a fatted one; which expelled a patrician from the senate on the serious ground, as it was
counted, of aspiring to be too great, because he had acquired ten pounds of silver; which
put down the theatres as quickly as they arose to debauch the manners of the people; which
did not permit the insignia of official dignities or of noble birth to be rashly or with impunity
usurped? For I see the Centenarian suppers must now bear the name, not from the hundred
asses, but from the hundred sestertia83 expended on them; and that mines of silver are made
into dishes (it were little if this applied only to senators, and not to freedmen or even mere
whip-spoilers84). I see, too, that neither is a single theatre enough, nor are theatres unsheltered:
no doubt it was that immodest pleasure might not be torpid in the wintertime,
the Lacedæmonians invented their woollen cloaks for the plays. I see now no difference
between the dress of matrons and prostitutes. In regard to women, indeed, those laws of
your fathers, which used to be such an encouragement to modesty and sobriety, have also
fallen into desuetude, when a woman had yet known no gold upon her save on the finger,
which, with the bridal ring, her husband had sacredly pledged to himself; when the abstinence
of women from wine was carried so far, that a matron, for opening the compartments of a
wine cellar, was starved to death by her friends,—while in the times of Romulus, for merely
tasting wine, Mecenius killed his wife, and suffered nothing for the deed. With reference to
this also, it was the custom of women to kiss their relatives, that they might be detected by
their breath. Where is that happiness of married life, ever so desirable, which distinguished
our earlier manners, and as the result of which for about 600 years there was not among us
a single divorce? Now, women have every member of the body heavy laden with gold; winebibbing
is so common among them, that the kiss is never offered with their will; and as for
divorce, they long for it as though it were the natural consequence of marriage. The laws,
too, your fathers in their wisdom had enacted concerning the very gods themselves, you
their most loyal children have rescinded. The consuls, by the authority of the senate, banished
Father Bacchus and his mysteries not merely from the city, but from the whole of Italy. The
consuls Piso and Gabinius, no Christians surely, forbade Serapis, and Isis, and Arpocrates,

with their dogheaded friend,85 admission into the Capitol—in the act casting them out from
the assembly of the gods—overthrow their altars, and expelled them from the country, being
anxious to prevent the vices of their base and lascivious religion from spreading. These, you
have restored, and conferred highest honours on them. What has come to your religion—of
the veneration due by you to your ancestors? In your dress, in your food, in your style of
life, in your opinions, and last of all in your very speech, you have renounced your progenitors.
You are always praising antiquity, and yet every day you have novelties in your way
of living. From your having failed to maintain what you should, you make it clear, that,
while you abandon the good ways of your fathers, you retain and guard the things you ought
not. Yet the very tradition of your fathers, which you still seem so faithfully to defend, and
in which you find your principal matter of accusation against the Christians—I mean zeal
in the worship of the gods, the point in which antiquity has mainly erred—although you
have rebuilt the altars of Serapis, now a Roman deity, and to Bacchus, now become a god
of Italy, you offer up your orgies,—I shall in its proper place show that you despise, neglect,
and overthrow, casting entirely aside the authority of the men of old. I go on meantime to
reply to that infamous charge of secret crimes, clearing my way to things of open day.</p>

<p>Monsters of wickedness, we are accused of observing a holy rite in which we kill a little
child and then eat it; in which, after the feast, we practise incest, the dogs—our pimps, forsooth,
overturning the lights and getting us the shamelessness of darkness for our impious
lusts. This is what is constantly laid to our charge, and yet you take no pains to elicit the
truth of what we have been so long accused. Either bring, then, the matter to the light of
day if you believe it, or give it no credit as having never inquired into it. On the ground of
your double dealing, we are entitled to lay it down to you that there is no reality in the thing
which you dare not expiscate. You impose on the executioner, in the case of Christians, a
duty the very opposite of expiscation: he is not to make them confess what they do, but to
make them deny what they are. We date the origin of our religion, as we have mentioned
before, from the reign of Tiberius. Truth and the hatred of truth come into our world together.
As soon as truth appears, it is regarded as an enemy. It has as many foes as there are
strangers to it: the Jews, as was to be looked for, from a spirit of rivalry; the soldiers, out of
a desire to extort money; our very domestics, by their nature. We are daily beset by foes, we
are daily betrayed; we are oftentimes surprised in our meetings and congregations. Whoever
happened withal upon an infant wailing, according to the common story? Whoever kept
for the judge, just as he had found them, the gory mouths of Cyclops and Sirens? Whoever
found any traces of uncleanness in their wives? Where is the man who, when he had discovered
such atrocities, concealed them; or, in the act of dragging the culprits before the
judge, was bribed into silence? If we always keep our secrets, when were our proceedings
made known to the world? Nay, by whom could they be made known? Not, surely, by the
guilty parties themselves; even from the very idea of the thing, the fealty of silence being
ever due to mysteries. The Samothracian and Eleusinian make no disclosures—how much
more will silence be kept in regard to such as are sure, in their unveiling, to call forth punishment
from man at once, while wrath divine is kept in store for the future? If, then,
Christians are not themselves the publishers of their crime, it follows of course it must be
strangers. And whence have they their knowledge, when it is also a universal custom in
religious initiations to keep the profane aloof, and to beware of witnesses, unless it be that
those who are so wicked have less fear than their neighbors? Every one knows what sort of
thing rumour is. It is one of your own sayings, that “among all evils, none flies so fast as
rumour.” Why is rumour such an evil thing? Is it because it is fleet? Is it because it carries
information? Or is it because it is in the highest degree mendacious?—a thing, not even
when it brings some truth to us, without a taint of falsehood, either detracting, or adding,
or changing from the simple fact? Nay more, it is the very law of its being to continue only
while it lies, and to live but so long as there is no proof; for when the proof is given, it ceases
to exist; and, as having done its work of merely spreading a report, it delivers up a fact, and
is henceforth held to be a fact, and called a fact. And then no one says, for instance, “They

<pb n="38"/>
say that it took place at Rome,” or, “There is a rumour that he has obtained a province,”
but, “He has got a province,” and, “It took place at Rome.” Rumour, the very designation
of uncertainty, has no place when a thing is certain. Does any but a fool put his trust in it?
For a wise man never believes the dubious. Everybody knows, however zealously it is spread
abroad, on whatever strength of asseveration it rests, that some time or other from some
one fountain it has its origin. Thence it must creep into propagating tongues and ears; and
a small seminal blemish so darkens all the rest of the story, that no one can determine
whether the lips, from which it first came forth, planted the seed of falsehood, as often
happens, from a spirit of opposition, or from a suspicious judgment, or from a confirmed,
nay, in the case of some, an inborn, delight in lying. It is well that time brings all to light, as
your proverbs and sayings testify, by a provision of Nature, which has so appointed things
that nothing long is hidden, even though rumour has not disseminated it. It is just then as
it should be, that fame for so long a period has been alone aware of the crimes of Christians.
This is the witness you bring against us—one that has never been able to prove the accusation
it some time or other sent abroad, and at last by mere continuance made into a settled
opinion in the world; so that I confidently appeal to Nature herself, ever true, against those
who groundlessly hold that such things are to be credited.</p>

<p>See now, we set before you the reward of these enormities. They give promise of eternal
life. Hold it meanwhile as your own belief. I ask you, then, whether, so believing, you think
it worth attaining with a conscience such as you will have. Come, plunge your knife into
the babe, enemy of none, accused of none, child of all; or if that is another’s work, simply
take your place beside a human being dying before he has really lived, await the departure
of the lately given soul, receive the fresh young blood, saturate your bread with it, freely
partake. The while as you recline at table, take note of the places which your mother and
your sister occupy; mark them well, so that when the dog-made darkness has fallen on you,
you may make no mistake, for you will be guilty of a crime—unless you perpetrate a deed
of incest. Initiated and sealed into things like these, you have life everlasting. Tell me, I pray
you, is eternity worth it? If it is not, then these things are not to be credited. Even although
you had the belief, I deny the will; and even if you had the will, I deny the possibility. Why
then can others do it, if you cannot? why cannot you, if others can? I suppose we are of a
different nature—are we Cynopæ or Sciapodes?86 You are a man yourself as well as the
Christian: if you cannot do it, you ought not to believe it of others, for a Christian is a man
as well as you. But the ignorant, forsooth, are deceived and imposed on. They were quite
unaware of anything of the kind being imputed to Christians, or they would certainly have
looked into it for themselves, and searched the matter out. Instead of that, it is the custom
for persons wishing initiation into sacred rites, I think, to go first of all to the master of
them, that he may explain what preparations are to be made. Then, in this case, no doubt
he would say, “You must have a child still of tender age, that knows not what it is to die,
and can smile under thy knife; bread, too, to collect the gushing blood; in addition to these,
candlesticks, and lamps, and dogs—with tid-bits to draw them on to the extinguishing of
the lights: above all things, you will require to bring your mother and your sister with you.”
But what if mother and sister are unwilling? or if there be neither the one nor the other?
What if there are Christians with no Christian relatives? He will not be counted, I suppose,
a true follower of Christ, who has not a brother or a son. And what now, if these things are
all in store for them without their knowledge? At least afterwards they come to know them;
and they bear with them, and pardon them. They fear, it may be said, lest they have to pay
for it if they let the secret out: nay, but they will rather in that case have every claim to protection;
they will even prefer, one might think, dying by their own hand, to living under the
burden of such a dreadful knowledge. Admit that they have this fear; yet why do they still
persevere? For it is plain enough that you will have no desire to continue what you would
never have been, if you had had previous knowledge of it.</p>

<p>That I may refute more thoroughly these charges, I will show that in part openly, in part
secretly, practices prevail among you which have led you perhaps to credit similar things
about us. Children were openly sacrificed in Africa to Saturn as lately as the proconsulship
of Tiberius, who exposed to public gaze the priests suspended on the sacred trees overshadowing
their temple—so many crosses on which the punishment which justice craved overtook
their crimes, as the soldiers of our country still can testify who did that very work for that
proconsul. And even now that sacred crime still continues to be done in secret. It is not only
Christians, you see, who despise you; for all that you do there is neither any crime thoroughly
and abidingly eradicated, nor does any of your gods reform his ways. When Saturn did not
spare his own children, he was not likely to spare the children of others; whom indeed the
very parents themselves were in the habit of offering, gladly responding to the call which
was made on them, and keeping the little ones pleased on the occasion, that they might not
die in tears. At the same time, there is a vast difference between homicide and parricide. A
more advanced age was sacrificed to Mercury in Gaul. I hand over the Tauric fables to their
own theatres. Why, even in that most religious city of the pious descendants of Æneas, there
is a certain Jupiter whom in their games they lave with human blood. It is the blood of a
beast-fighter, you say. Is it less, because of that, the blood of a man?87 Or is it viler blood
because it is from the veins of a wicked man? At any rate it is shed in murder. O Jove, thyself
a Christian, and in truth only son of thy father in his cruelty! But in regard to child murder,
as it does not matter whether it is committed for a sacred object, or merely at one’s own
self-impulse—although there is a great difference, as we have said, between parricide and
homicide—I shall turn to the people generally. How many, think you, of those crowding
around and gaping for Christian blood,—how many even of your rulers, notable for their
justice to you and for their severe measures against us, may I charge in their own consciences
with the sin of putting their offspring to death? As to any difference in the kind of murder,
it is certainly the more cruel way to kill by drowning, or by exposure to cold and hunger
and dogs. A maturer age has always preferred death by the sword. In our case, murder being
once for all forbidden, we may not destroy even the foetus in the womb, while as yet the
human being derives blood from other parts of the body for its sustenance. To hinder a
birth is merely a speedier man-killing; nor does it matter whether you take away a life that
is born, or destroy one that is coming to the birth. That is a man which is going to be one;
you have the fruit already in its seed. As to meals of blood and such tragic dishes, read—I
am not sure where it is told (it is in Herodotus, I think)—how blood taken from the arms,
and tasted by both parties, has been the treaty bond among some nations. I am not sure
what it was that was tasted in the time of Catiline. They say, too, that among some Scythian
<note type="footnote">87 [Another example of what Christianity was doing for man as man.]</note>

<pb n="41"/>
tribes the dead are eaten by their friends. But I am going far from home. At this day, among
ourselves, blood consecrated to Bellona, blood drawn from a punctured thigh and then
partaken of, seals initiation into the rites of that goddess. Those, too, who at the gladiator
shows, for the cure of epilepsy, quaff with greedy thirst the blood of criminals slain in the
arena, as it flows fresh from the wound, and then rush off—to whom do they belong? those,
also, who make meals on the flesh of wild beasts at the place of combat—who have keen
appetites for bear and stag? That bear in the struggle was bedewed with the blood of the
man whom it lacerated: that stag rolled itself in the gladiator’s gore. The entrails of the very
bears, loaded with as yet undigested human viscera, are in great request. And you have men
rifting up man-fed flesh? If you partake of food like this, how do your repasts differ from
those you accuse us Christians of? And do those, who, with savage lust, seize on human
bodies, do less because they devour the living? Have they less the pollution of human blood
on them because they only lick up what is to turn into blood? They make meals, it is plain,
not so much of infants, as of grown-up men. Blush for your vile ways before the Christians,
who have not even the blood of animals at their meals of simple and natural food; who abstain
from things strangled and that die a natural death, for no other reason than that they may
not contract pollution, so much as from blood secreted in the viscera. To clench the matter
with a single example, you tempt Christians with sausages of blood, just because you are
perfectly aware that the thing by which you thus try to get them to transgress they hold
unlawful.88 And how unreasonable it is to believe that those, of whom you are convinced
that they regard with horror the idea of tasting the blood of oxen, are eager after blood of
men; unless, mayhap, you have tried it, and found it sweeter to the taste! Nay, in fact, there
is here a test you should apply to discover Christians, as well as the fire-pan and the censer.
They should be proved by their appetite for human blood, as well as by their refusal to offer
sacrifice; just as otherwise they should be affirmed to be free of Christianity by their refusal
to taste of blood, as by their sacrificing; and there would be no want of blood of men, amply
supplied as that would be in the trial and condemnation of prisoners. Then who are more
given to the crime of incest than those who have enjoyed the instruction of Jupiter himself?
Ctesias tells us that the Persians have illicit intercourse with their mothers. The Macedonians,
too, are suspected on this point; for on first hearing the tragedy of OEdipus they made mirth
of the incest-doer’s grief, exclaiming, ῾ἥλαυνε εἰς τὴν μητέρα. Even now reflect what opportunity
there is for mistakes leading to incestuous comminglings—your promiscuous looseness
supplying the materials. You first of all expose your children, that they may be taken up by
any compassionate passer-by, to whom they are quite unknown; or you give them away, to
be adopted by those who will do better to them the part of parents. Well, some time or
other, all memory of the alienated progeny must be lost; and when once a mistake has been
<note type="footnote">88 [See Elucidation VII., p. 58, infra in connection with usages in cap. xxxix.]</note>

<pb n="42"/>
made, the transmission of incest thence will still go on—the race and the crime creeping on
together. Then, further, wherever you are—at home, abroad, over the seas—your lust is an
attendant, whose general indulgence, or even its indulgence in the most limited scale, may
easily and unwittingly anywhere beget children, so that in this way a progeny scattered about
in the commerce of life may have intercourse with those who are their own kin, and have
no notion that there is any incest in the case. A persevering and stedfast chastity has protected
us from anything like this: keeping as we do from adulteries and all post-matrimonial unfaithfulness,
we are not exposed to incestuous mishaps. Some of us, making matters still
more secure, beat away from them entirely the power of sensual sin, by a virgin continence,
still boys in this respect when they are old. If you would but take notice that such sins as I
have mentioned prevail among you, that would lead you to see that they have no existence
among Christians. The same eyes would tell you of both facts. But the two blindnesses are
apt to go together; so that those who do not see what is, think they see what is not. I shall
show it to be so in everything. But now let me speak of matters which are more clear.</p>

<p>“You do not worship the gods,” you say; “and you do not offer sacrifices for the emperors.”
Well, we do not offer sacrifice for others, for the same reason that we do not for
ourselves,—namely, that your gods are not at all the objects of our worship. So we are accused
of sacrilege and treason. This is the chief ground of charge against us—nay, it is the sumtotal
of our offending; and it is worthy then of being inquired into, if neither prejudice nor
injustice be the judge, the one of which has no idea of discovering the truth, and the other
simply and at once rejects it. We do not worship your gods, because we know that there are
no such beings. This, therefore, is what you should do: you should call on us to demonstrate
their non-existence, and thereby prove that they have no claim to adoration; for only if your
gods were truly so, would there be any obligation to render divine homage to them. And
punishment even were due to Christians, if it were made plain that those to whom they refused
all worship were indeed divine. But you say, They are gods. We protest and appeal
from yourselves to your knowledge; let that judge us; let that condemn us, if it can deny that
all these gods of yours were but men. If even it venture to deny that, it will be confuted by
its own books of antiquities, from which it has got its information about them, bearing
witness to this day, as they plainly do, both of the cities in which they were born, and the
countries in which they have left traces of their exploits, as well as where also they are proved
to have been buried. Shall I now, therefore, go over them one by one, so numerous and so
various, new and old, barbarian, Grecian, Roman, foreign, captive and adopted, private and
common, male and female, rural and urban, naval and military? It were useless even to hunt
out all their names: so I may content myself with a compend; and this not for your information,
but that you may have what you know brought to your recollection, for undoubtedly
you act as if you had forgotten all about them. No one of your gods is earlier than Saturn:
from him you trace all your deities, even those of higher rank and better known. What, then,
can be proved of the first, will apply to those that follow. So far, then, as books give us information,
neither the Greek Diodorus or Thallus, neither Cassius Severus or Cornelius
Nepos, nor any writer upon sacred antiquities, have ventured to say that Saturn was any
but a man: so far as the question depends on facts, I find none more trustworthy than those
—that in Italy itself we have the country in which, after many expeditions, and after having
partaken of Attic hospitalities, Saturn settled, obtaining cordial welcome from Janus, or, as
the Salii will have it, Janis. The mountain on which he dwelt was called Saturnius; the city
he founded is called Saturnia to this day; last of all, the whole of Italy, after having borne
the name of Oenotria, was called Saturnia from him. He first gave you the art of writing,
and a stamped coinage, and thence it is he presides over the public treasury. But if Saturn
were a man, he had undoubtedly a human origin; and having a human origin, he was not
the offspring of heaven and earth. As his parents were unknown, it was not unnatural that
he should be spoken of as the son of those elements from which we might all seem to spring.

<pb n="44"/>
For who does not speak of heaven and earth as father and mother, in a sort of way of veneration
and honour? or from the custom which prevails among us of saying that persons of
whom we have no knowledge, or who make a sudden appearance, have fallen from the skies?
In this way it came about that Saturn, everywhere a sudden and unlooked-for guest, got
everywhere the name of the Heaven-born. For even the common folk call persons whose
stock is unknown, sons of earth. I say nothing of how men in these rude times were wont
to act, when they were impressed by the look of any stranger happening to appear among
them, as though it were divine, since even at this day men of culture make gods of those
whom, a day or two before, they acknowledged to be dead men by their public mourning
for them. Let these notices of Saturn, brief as they are, suffice. It will thus also be proved
that Jupiter is as certainly a man, as from a man he sprung; and that one after another the
whole swarm is mortal like the primal stock.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.</head>
<p>And since, as you dare not deny that these deities of yours once were men, you have
taken it on you to assert that they were made gods after their decease, let us consider what
necessity there was for this. In the first place, you must concede the existence of one higher
God—a certain wholesale dealer in divinity, who has made gods of men. For they could
neither have assumed a divinity which was not theirs, nor could any but one himself possessing
it have conferred it on them. If there was no one to make gods, it is vain to dream
of gods being made when thus you have no god-maker. Most certainly, if they could have
deified themselves, with a higher state at their command, they never would have been men.
If, then, there be one who is able to make gods, I turn back to an examination of any reason
there may be for making gods at all; and I find no other reason than this, that the great God
has need of their ministrations and aids in performing the offices of Deity. But first it is an
unworthy idea that He should need the help of a man, and in fact a dead man, when, if He
was to be in want of this assistance from the dead, He might more fittingly have created
some one a god at the beginning. Nor do I see any place for his action. For this entire worldmass—
whether self-existent and uncreated, as Pythagoras maintains, or brought into being
by a creator’s hands, as Plato holds—was manifestly, once for all in its original construction,
disposed, and furnished, and ordered, and supplied with a government of perfect wisdom.
That cannot be imperfect which has made all perfect. There was nothing waiting on for
Saturn and his race to do. Men will make fools of themselves if they refuse to believe that
from the very first rain poured down from the sky, and stars gleamed, and light shone, and
thunders roared, and Jove himself dreaded the lightnings you put in his hands; that in like
manner before Bacchus, and Ceres, and Minerva, nay before the first man, whoever that
was, every kind of fruit burst forth plentifully from the bosom of the earth, for nothing
provided for the support and sustenance of man could be introduced after his entrance on
the stage of being. Accordingly, these necessaries of life are said to have been discovered,
not created. But the thing you discover existed before; and that which had a pre-existence
must be regarded as belonging not to him who discovered it, but to him who made it, for
of course it had a being before it could be found. But if, on account of his being the discoverer
of the vine, Bacchus is raised to godship, Lucullus, who first introduced the cherry from
Pontus into Italy, has not been fairly dealt with; for as the discoverer of a new fruit, he has
not, as though he were its creator, been awarded divine honours. Wherefore, if the universe
existed from the beginning, thoroughly furnished with its system working under certain
laws for the performance of its functions, there is, in this respect, an entire absence of all
reason for electing humanity to divinity; for the positions and powers which you have assigned
to your deities have been from the beginning precisely what they would have been,
although you had never deified them. But you turn to another reason, telling us that the

<pb n="46"/>
conferring of deity was a way of rewarding worth. And hence you grant, I conclude, that
the god-making God is of transcendent righteousness,—one who will neither rashly, improperly,
nor needlessly bestow a reward so great. I would have you then consider whether the
merits of your deities are of a kind to have raised them to the heavens, and not rather to
have sunk them down into lowest depths of Tartarus,—the place which you regard, with
many, as the prison-house of infernal punishments. For into this dread place are wont to
be cast all who offend against filial piety, and such as are guilty of incest with sisters, and
seducers of wives, and ravishers of virgins, and boy-polluters, and men of furious tempers,
and murderers, and thieves, and deceivers; all, in short, who tread in the footsteps of your
gods, not one of whom you can prove free from crime or vice, save by denying that they
had ever a human existence. But as you cannot deny that, you have those foul blots also as
an added reason for not believing that they were made gods afterwards. For if you rule for
the very purpose of punishing such deeds; if every virtuous man among you rejects all correspondence,
converse, and intimacy with the wicked and base, while, on the other hand,
the high God has taken up their mates to a share of His majesty, on what ground is it that
you thus condemn those whose fellow-actors you adore? Your goodness is an affront in the
heavens. Deify your vilest criminals, if you would please your gods. You honour them by
giving divine honours to their fellows. But to say no more about a way of acting so unworthy,
there have been men virtuous, and pure, and good. Yet how many of these nobler men you
have left in the regions of doom! as Socrates, so renowned for his wisdom, Aristides for his
justice, Themistocles for his warlike genius, Alexander for his sublimity of soul, Polycrates
for his good fortune, Croesus for his wealth, Demosthenes for his eloquence. Which of these
gods of yours is more remarkable for gravity and wisdom than Cato, more just and warlike
than Scipio? which of them more magnanimous than Pompey, more prosperous than Sylla,
of greater wealth than Crassus, more eloquent than Tullius? How much better it would have
been for the God Supreme to have waited that He might have taken such men as these to
be His heavenly associates, prescient as He must have surely been of their worthier character!
He was in a hurry, I suppose, and straightway shut heaven’s gates; and now He must surely
feel ashamed at these worthies murmuring over their lot in the regions below.</p>

<p>But I pass from these remarks, for I know and I am going to show what your gods are
not, by showing what they are. In reference, then, to these, I see only names of dead men of
ancient times; I hear fabulous stories; I recognize sacred rites founded on mere myths. As
to the actual images, I regard them as simply pieces of matter akin to the vessels and utensils
in common use among us, or even undergoing in their consecration a hapless change from
these useful articles at the hands of reckless art, which in the transforming process treats
them with utter contempt, nay, in the very act commits sacrilege; so that it might be no
slight solace to us in all our punishments, suffering as we do because of these same gods,
that in their making they suffer as we do themselves. You put Christians on crosses and
stakes:89 what image is not formed from the clay in the first instance, set on cross and stake?
The body of your god is first consecrated on the gibbet. You tear the sides of Christians with
your claws; but in the case of your own gods, axes, and planes, and rasps are put to work
more vigorously on every member of the body. We lay our heads upon the block; before
the lead, and the glue, and the nails are put in requisition, your deities are headless. We are
cast to the wild beasts, while you attach them to Bacchus, and Cybele, and Cælestis. We are
burned in the flames; so, too, are they in their original lump. We are condemned to the
mines; from these your gods originate. We are banished to islands; in islands it is a common
thing for your gods to have their birth or die. If it is in this way a deity is made, it will follow
that as many as are punished are deified, and tortures will have to be declared divinities.
But plain it is these objects of your worship have no sense of the injuries and disgraces of
their consecrating, as they are equally unconscious of the honours paid to them. O impious
words! O blasphemous reproaches! Gnash your teeth upon us—foam with maddened rage
against us—ye are the persons, no doubt, who censured a certain Seneca speaking of your
superstition at much greater length and far more sharply! In a word, if we refuse our homage
to statues and frigid images, the very counterpart of their dead originals, with which hawks,
and mice, and spiders are so well acquainted, does it not merit praise instead of penalty,
that we have rejected what we have come to see is error? We cannot surely be made out to
injure those who we are certain are nonentities. What does not exist, is in its nonexistence
secure from suffering.</p>

<p>“But they are gods to us,” you say. And how is it, then, that in utter inconsistency with
this, you are convicted of impious, sacrilegious, and irreligious conduct to them, neglecting
those you imagine to exist, destroying those who are the objects of your fear, making mock
of those whose honour you avenge? See now if I go beyond the truth. First, indeed, seeing
you worship, some one god, and some another, of course you give offence to those you do
not worship. You cannot continue to give preference to one without slighting another, for
selection implies rejection. You despise, therefore, those whom you thus reject; for in your
rejection of them, it is plain you have no dread of giving them offence. For, as we have
already shown, every god depended on the decision of the senate for his godhead. No god
was he whom man in his own counsels did not wish to be so, and thereby condemned. The
family deities you call Lares, you exercise a domestic authority over, pledging them, selling
them, changing them—making sometimes a cooking-pot of a Saturn, a firepan of a Minerva,
as one or other happens to be worn down, or broken in its long sacred use, or as the family
head feels the pressure of some more sacred home necessity. In like manner, by public law
you disgrace your state gods, putting them in the auction-catalogue, and making them a
source of revenue. Men seek to get the Capitol, as they seek to get the herb market, under
the voice of the crier, under the auction spear, under the registration of the quæstor. Deity
is struck off and farmed out to the highest bidder. But indeed lands burdened with tribute
are of less value; men under the assessment of a poll-tax are less noble; for these things are
the marks of servitude. In the case of the gods, on the other hand, the sacredness is great in
proportion to the tribute which they yield; nay, the more sacred is a god, the larger is the
tax he pays. Majesty is made a source of gain. Religion goes about the taverns begging. You
demand a price for the privilege of standing on temple ground, for access to the sacred services;
there is no gratuitous knowledge of your divinities permitted—you must buy their
favours with a price. What honours in any way do you render to them that you do not render
to the dead? You have temples in the one case just as in the other; you have altars in the one
case as in the other. Their statues have the same dress, the same insignia. As the dead man
had his age, his art, his occupation, so it is with the deity. In what respect does the funeral
feast differ from the feast of Jupiter? or the bowl of the gods from the ladle of the manes?
or the undertaker from the soothsayer, as in fact this latter personage also attends upon the
dead? With perfect propriety you give divine honours to your departed emperors, as you
worship them in life. The gods will count themselves indebted to you; nay, it will be matter
of high rejoicing among them that their masters are made their equals. But when you adore
Larentina, a public prostitute—I could have wished that it might at least have been Lais or
Phryne—among your Junos, and Cereses, and Dianas; when you instal in your Pantheon

<p>I wish now to review your sacred rites; and I pass no censure on your sacrificing, when
you offer the worn-out, the scabbed, the corrupting; when you cut off from the fat and the
sound the useless parts, such as the head and the hoofs, which in your house you would
have assigned to the slaves or the dogs; when of the tithe of Hercules you do not lay a third
upon his altar (I am disposed rather to praise your wisdom in rescuing something from
being lost); but turning to your books, from which you get your training in wisdom and the
nobler duties of life, what utterly ridiculous things I find!—that for Trojans and Greeks the
gods fought among themselves like pairs of gladiators; that Venus was wounded by a man,
because she would rescue her son Æneas when he was in peril of his life from the same
Diomede; that Mars was almost wasted away by a thirteen months’ imprisonment; that
Jupiter was saved by a monster’s aid from suffering the same violence at the hands of the
other gods; that he now laments the fate of Sarpedon, now foully makes love to his own
sister, recounting (to her) former mistresses, now for a long time past not so dear as she.
After this, what poet is not found copying the example of his chief, to be a disgracer of the
gods? One gives Apollo to king Admetus to tend his sheep; another hires out the building
labours of Neptune to Laomedon. A well-known lyric poet, too—Pindar, I mean—sings of
Æsculapius deservedly stricken with lightning for his greed in practising wrongfully his art.
A wicked deed it was of Jupiter—if he hurled the bolt—unnatural to his grandson, and exhibiting
envious feeling to the Physician. Things like these should not be made public if they
are true; and if false, they should not be fabricated among people professing a great respect
for religion. Nor indeed do either tragic or comic writers shrink from setting forth the gods
as the origin of all family calamities and sins. I do not dwell on the philosophers, contenting
myself with a reference to Socrates, who, in contempt of the gods, was in the habit of
swearing by an oak, and a goat, and a dog. In fact, for this very thing Socrates was condemned
to death, that he overthrew the worship of the gods. Plainly, at one time as well as another,
that is, always truth is disliked. However, when rueing their judgment, the Athenians inflicted
punishment on his accusers, and set up a golden image of him in a temple, the condemnation
was in the very act rescinded, and his witness was restored to its former value. Diogenes,
too, makes utter mock of Hercules and the Roman cynic Varro brings forward three hundred
Joves, or Jupiters they should be called, all headless.</p>

<p>Others of your writers, in their wantonness, even minister to your pleasures by vilifying
the gods. Examine those charming farces of your Lentuli and Hostilii, whether in the jokes
and tricks it is the buffoons or the deities which afford you merriment; such farces I mean
as Anubis the Adulterer, and Luna of the masculine gender, and Diana under the lash, and
the reading the will of Jupiter deceased, and the three famishing Herculeses held up to ridicule.
Your dramatic literature, too, depicts all the vileness of your gods. The Sun mourns
his offspring91 cast down from heaven, and you are full of glee; Cybele sighs after the
scornful swain,92 and you do not blush; you brook the stage recital of Jupiter’s misdeeds,
and the shepherd93 judging Juno, Venus, and Minerva. Then, again, when the likeness of a
god is put on the head of an ignominious and infamous wretch, when one impure and
trained up for the art in all effeminacy, represents a Minerva or a Hercules, is not the majesty
of your gods insulted, and their deity dishonored? Yet you not merely look on, but applaud.
You are, I suppose, more devout in the arena, where after the same fashion your deities
dance on human blood, on the pollutions caused by inflicted punishments, as they act their
themes and stories, doing their turn for the wretched criminals, except that these, too, often
put on divinity and actually play the very gods. We have seen in our day a representation
of the mutilation of Attis, that famous god of Pessinus, and a man burnt alive as Hercules.
We have made merry amid the ludicrous cruelties of the noonday exhibition, at Mercury
examining the bodies of the dead with his hot iron; we have witnessed Jove’s brother,94
mallet in hand, dragging out the corpses of the gladiators. But who can go into everything
of this sort? If by such things as these the honour of deity is assailed, if they go to blot out
every trace of its majesty, we must explain them by the contempt in which the gods are held,
alike by those who actually do them, and by those for whose enjoyment they are done. This
it will be said, however, is all in sport. But if I add—it is what all know and will admit as
readily to be the fact—that in the temples adulteries are arranged, that at the altars pimping
is practised, that often in the houses of the temple-keepers and priests, under the sacrificial
fillets, and the sacred hats,95 and the purple robes, amid the fumes of incense, deeds of licentiousness
are done, I am not sure but your gods have more reason to complain of you
than of Christians. It is certainly among the votaries of your religion that the perpetrators
of sacrilege are always found, for Christians do not enter your temples even in the day-time.

Perhaps they too would be spoilers of them, if they worshipped in them. What then do they
worship, since their objects of worship are different from yours? Already indeed it is implied,
as the corollary from their rejection of the lie, that they render homage to the truth; nor
continue longer in an error which they have given up in the very fact of recognizing it to be
an error. Take this in first of all, and when we have offered a preliminary refutation of some
false opinions, go on to derive from it our entire religious system.</p>

<p>For, like some others, you are under the delusion that our god is an ass’s head.96 Cor
nelius Tacitus first put this notion into people’s minds. In the fifth book of his histories,
beginning the (narrative of the) Jewish war with an account of the origin of the nation; and
theorizing at his pleasure about the origin, as well as the name and the religion of the Jews,
he states that having been delivered, or rather, in his opinion, expelled from Egypt, in
crossing the vast plains of Arabia, where water is so scanty, they were in extremity from
thirst; but taking the guidance of the wild asses, which it was thought might be seeking water
after feeding, they discovered a fountain, and thereupon in their gratitude they consecrated
a head of this species of animal. And as Christianity is nearly allied to Judaism, from this, I
suppose, it was taken for granted that we too are devoted to the worship of the same image.
But the said Cornelius Tacitus (the very opposite of tacit in telling lies) informs us in the
work already mentioned, that when Cneius Pompeius captured Jerusalem, he entered the
temple to see the arcana of the Jewish religion, but found no image there. Yet surely if worship
was rendered to any visible object, the very place for its exhibition would be the shrine; and
that all the more that the worship, however unreasonable, had no need there to fear outside
beholders. For entrance to the holy place was permitted to the priests alone, while all vision
was forbidden to others by an outspread curtain. You will not, however, deny that all beasts
of burden, and not parts of them, but the animals entire, are with their goddess Epona objects
of worship with you. It is this, perhaps, which displeases you in us, that while your worship
here is universal, we do homage only to the ass. Then, if any of you think we render superstitious
adoration to the cross, in that adoration he is sharer with us. If you offer homage
to a piece of wood at all, it matters little what it is like when the substance is the same: it is
of no consequence the form, if you have the very body of the god. And yet how far does the
Athenian Pallas differ from the stock of the cross, or the Pharian Ceres as she is put up uncarved
to sale, a mere rough stake and piece of shapeless wood? Every stake fixed in an upright
position is a portion of the cross; we render our adoration, if you will have it so, to a god
entire and complete. We have shown before that your deities are derived from shapes
modelled from the cross. But you also worship victories, for in your trophies the cross is
the heart of the trophy.97 The camp religion of the Romans is all through a worship of the
standards, a setting the standards above all gods. Well, as those images decking out the
standards are ornaments of crosses. All those hangings of your standards and banners are
robes of crosses. I praise your zeal: you would not consecrate crosses unclothed and unadorned.
Others, again, certainly with more information and greater verisimilitude, believe

that the sun is our god. We shall be counted Persians perhaps, though we do not worship
the orb of day painted on a piece of linen cloth, having himself everywhere in his own disk.
The idea no doubt has originated from our being known to turn to the east in prayer.98 But
you, many of you, also under pretence sometimes of worshipping the heavenly bodies, move
your lips in the direction of the sunrise. In the same way, if we devote Sun-day to rejoicing,
from a far different reason than Sun-worship, we have some resemblance to those of you
who devote the day of Saturn to ease and luxury, though they too go far away from Jewish
ways, of which indeed they are ignorant. But lately a new edition of our god has been given
to the world in that great city: it originated with a certain vile man who was wont to hire
himself out to cheat the wild beasts, and who exhibited a picture with this inscription: The
God of the Christians, born of an ass.99 He had the ears of an ass, was hoofed in one foot,
carried a book,100 and wore a toga. Both the name and the figure gave us amusement. But
our opponents ought straightway to have done homage to this biformed divinity, for they
have acknowledged gods dog-headed and lion-headed, with horn of buck and ram, with
goat-like loins, with serpent legs, with wings sprouting from back or foot. These things we
have discussed ex abundanti, that we might not seem willingly to pass by any rumor against
us unrefuted. Having thoroughly cleared ourselves, we turn now to an exhibition of what
our religion really is.</p>

<p>The object of our worship is the One God,101 He who by His commanding word, His
arranging wisdom, His mighty power, brought forth from nothing this entire mass of our
world, with all its array of elements, bodies, spirits, for the glory of His majesty; whence also
the Greeks have bestowed on it the name of Κόσμος. The eye cannot see Him, though He
is (spiritually) visible. He is incomprehensible, though in grace He is manifested. He is
beyond our utmost thought, though our human faculties conceive of Him. He is therefore
equally real and great. But that which, in the ordinary sense, can be seen and handled and
conceived, is inferior to the eyes by which it is taken in, and the hands by which it is tainted,
and the faculties by which it is discovered; but that which is infinite is known only to itself.
This it is which gives some notion of God, while yet beyond all our conceptions—our very
incapacity of fully grasping Him affords us the idea of what He really is. He is presented to
our minds in His transcendent greatness, as at once known and unknown. And this is the
crowning guilt of men, that they will not recognize One, of whom they cannot possibly be
ignorant. Would you have the proof from the works of His hands, so numerous and so great,
which both contain you and sustain you, which minister at once to your enjoyment, and
strike you with awe; or would you rather have it from the testimony of the soul itself? Though
under the oppressive bondage of the body, though led astray by depraving customs, though
enervated by lusts and passions, though in slavery to false gods; yet, whenever the soul comes
to itself, as out of a surfeit, or a sleep, or a sickness, and attains something of its natural
soundness, it speaks of God; using no other word, because this is the peculiar name of the
true God. “God is great and good”—“Which may God give,” are the words on every lip. It
bears witness, too, that God is judge, exclaiming, “God sees,” and, “I commend myself to
God,” and, “God will repay me.” O noble testimony of the soul by nature102 Christian! Then,
too, in using such words as these, it looks not to the Capitol, but to the heavens. It knows
that there is the throne of the living God, as from Him and from thence itself came down.</p>

<p>But, that we might attain an ampler and more authoritative knowledge at once of
Himself, and of His counsels and will, God has added a written revelation for the behoof of
every one whose heart is set on seeking Him, that seeking he may find, and finding believe,
and believing obey. For from the first He sent messengers into the world,—men whose
stainless righteousness made them worthy to know the Most High, and to reveal Him,—men
abundantly endowed with the Holy Spirit, that they might proclaim that there is one God
only who made all things, who formed man from the dust of the ground (for He is the true
Prometheus who gave order to the world by arranging the seasons and their course),—these
have further set before us the proofs He has given of His majesty in His judgments by floods
and fires, the rules appointed by Him for securing His favour, as well as the retribution in
store for the ignoring, forsaking and keeping them, as being about at the end of all to adjudge
His worshippers to everlasting life, and the wicked to the doom of fire at once without
ending and without break, raising up again all the dead from the beginning, reforming and
renewing them with the object of awarding either recompense. Once these things were with
us, too, the theme of ridicule. We are of your stock and nature: men are made, not born,
Christians. The preachers of whom we have spoken are called prophets, from the office
which belongs to them of predicting the future. Their words, as well as the miracles which
they performed, that men might have faith in their divine authority, we have still in the literary
treasures they have left, and which are open to all. Ptolemy, surnamed Philadelphus,
the most learned of his race, a man of vast acquaintance with all literature, emulating, I
imagine, the book enthusiasm of Pisistratus, among other remains of the past which either
their antiquity or something of peculiar interest made famous, at the suggestion of Demetrius
Phalereus, who was renowned above all grammarians of his time, and to whom he had
committed the management of these things, applied to the Jews for their writings—I mean
the writings peculiar to them and in their tongue, which they alone possessed, for from
themselves, as a people dear to God for their fathers’ sake, their prophets had ever sprung,
and to them they had ever spoken. Now in ancient times the people we call Jews bare the
name of Hebrews, and so both their writings and their speech were Hebrew. But that the
understanding of their books might not be wanting, this also the Jews supplied to Ptolemy;
for they gave him seventy-two interpreters—men whom the philosopher Menedemus, the
well-known asserter of a Providence, regarded with respect as sharing in his views. The
same account is given by Aristæus. So the king left these works unlocked to all, in the Greek
language.103 To this day, at the temple of Serapis, the libraries of Ptolemy are to be seen,
with the identical Hebrew originals in them. The Jews, too, read them publicly. Under a

ear will find God in them; whoever takes pains to understand, will be compelled to believe.</p>

<p>Their high antiquity, first of all, claims authority for these writings. With you, too, it
is a kind of religion to demand belief on this very ground. Well, all the substances, all the
materials, the origins, classes, contents of your most ancient writings, even most nations
and cities illustrious in the records of the past and noted for their antiquity in books of annals,—
the very forms of your letters, those revealers and custodiers of events, nay (I think
I speak still within the mark), your very gods themselves, your very temples and oracles,
and sacred rites, are less ancient than the work of a single prophet, in whom you have the
thesaurus of the entire Jewish religion, and therefore too of ours. If you happen to have
heard of a certain Moses, I speak first of him: he is as far back as the Argive Inachus; by
nearly four hundred years—only seven less—he precedes Danaus, your most ancient name;
while he antedates by a millennium the death of Priam. I might affirm, too, that he is five
hundred years earlier than Homer, and have supporters of that view. The other prophets
also, though of later date, are, even the most recent of them, as far back as the first of your
philosophers, and legislators, and historians. It is not so much the difficulty of the subject,
as its vastness, that stands in the way of a statement of the grounds on which these statements
rest; the matter is not so arduous as it would be tedious. It would require the anxious study
of many books, and the fingers busy reckoning. The histories of the most ancient nations,
such as the Egyptians, the Chaldeans, the Phoenicians, would need to be ransacked; the men
of these various nations who have information to give, would have to be called in as witnesses.
Manetho the Egyptian, and Berosus the Chaldean, and Hieromus the Phoenician king of
Tyre; their successors too, Ptolemy the Mendesian, and Demetrius Phalereus, and King
Juba, and Apion, and Thallus, and their critic the Jew Josephus, the native vindicator of the
ancient history of his people, who either authenticates or refutes the others. Also the Greek
censors’ lists must be compared, and the dates of events ascertained, that the chronological
connections may be opened up, and thus the reckonings of the various annals be made to
give forth light. We must go abroad into the histories and literature of all nations. And, in
fact, we have already brought the proof in part before you, in giving those hints as to how
it is to be effected. But it seems better to delay the full discussion of this, lest in our haste we
do not sufficiently carry it out, or lest in its thorough handling we make too lengthened a
digression.</p>

<p>To make up for our delay in this, we bring under your notice something of even greater
importance; we point to the majesty of our Scriptures, if not to their antiquity. If you doubt
that they are as ancient as we say, we offer proof that they are divine. And you may convince
yourselves of this at once, and without going very far. Your instructors, the world, and the
age, and the event, are all before you. All that is taking place around you was fore-announced;
all that you now see with your eye was previously heard by the ear. The swallowing up of
cities by the earth; the theft of islands by the sea; wars, bringing external and internal convulsions;
the collision of kingdoms with kingdoms; famines and pestilences, and local massacres,
and widespread desolating mortalities; the exaltation of the lowly, and the humbling
of the proud; the decay of righteousness, the growth of sin, the slackening interest in all
good ways; the very seasons and elements going out of their ordinary course, monsters and
portents taking the place of nature’s forms—it was all foreseen and predicted before it came
to pass. While we suffer the calamities, we read of them in the Scriptures; as we examine,
they are proved. Well, the truth of a prophecy, I think, is the demonstration of its being
from above. Hence there is among us an assured faith in regard to coming events as things
already proved to us, for they were predicted along with what we have day by day fulfilled.
They are uttered by the same voices, they are written in the same books—the same Spirit
inspires them. All time is one to prophecy foretelling the future. Among men, it may be, a
distinction of times is made while the fulfilment is going on: from being future we think of
it as present, and then from being present we count it as belonging to the past. How are we
to blame, I pray you, that we believe in things to come as though they already were, with
the grounds we have for our faith in these two steps?</p>

<p>But having asserted that our religion is supported by the writings of the Jews, the oldest
which exist, though it is generally known, and we fully admit that it dates from a comparat-
ively recent period—no further back indeed than the reign of Tiberius—a question may
perhaps be raised on this ground about its standing, as if it were hiding something of its
presumption under shadow of an illustrious religion, one which has at any rate undoubted
allowance of the law, or because, apart from the question of age, we neither accord with the
Jews in their peculiarities in regard to food, nor in their sacred days, nor even in their wellknown
bodily sign, nor in the possession of a common name, which surely behoved to be
the case if we did homage to the same God as they. Then, too, the common people have
now some knowledge of Christ, and think of Him as but a man, one indeed such as the Jews
condemned, so that some may naturally enough have taken up the idea that we are worshippers
of a mere human being. But we are neither ashamed of Christ—for we rejoice to be
counted His disciples, and in His name to suffer—nor do we differ from the Jews concerning
God. We must make, therefore, a remark or two as to Christ’s divinity. In former times the
Jews enjoyed much of God’s favour, when the fathers of their race were noted for their
righteousness and faith. So it was that as a people they flourished greatly, and their kingdom
attained to a lofty eminence; and so highly blessed were they, that for their instruction God
spake to them in special revelations, pointing out to them beforehand how they should
merit His favor and avoid His displeasure. But how deeply they have sinned, puffed up to
their fall with a false trust in their noble ancestors, turning from God’s way into a way of
sheer impiety, though they themselves should refuse to admit it, their present national ruin
would afford sufficient proof. Scattered abroad, a race of wanderers, exiles from their own
land and clime, they roam over the whole world without either a human or a heavenly king,
not possessing even the stranger’s right to set so much as a simple footstep in their native
country. The sacred writers withal, in giving previous warning of these things, all with equal
clearness ever declared that, in the last days of the world, God would, out of every nation,
and people, and country, choose for Himself more faithful worshippers, upon whom He
would bestow His grace, and that indeed in ampler measure, in keeping with the enlarged
capacities of a nobler dispensation. Accordingly, He appeared among us, whose coming to
renovate and illuminate man’s nature was pre-announced by God—I mean Christ, that Son
of God. And so the supreme Head and Master of this grace and discipline, the Enlightener
and Trainer of the human race, God’s own Son, was announced among us, born—but not
so born as to make Him ashamed of the name of Son or of His paternal origin. It was not
His lot to have as His father, by incest with a sister, or by violation of a daughter or another’s
wife, a god in the shape of serpent, or ox, or bird, or lover, for his vile ends transmuting
himself into the gold of Danaus. They are your divinities upon whom these base deeds of
Jupiter were done. But the Son of God has no mother in any sense which involves impurity;

<pb n="61"/>
she, whom men suppose to be His mother in the ordinary way, had never entered into the
marriage bond.104 But, first, I shall discuss His essential nature, and so the nature of His
birth will be understood. We have already asserted that God made the world, and all which
it contains, by His Word, and Reason, and Power. It is abundantly plain that your philosophers,
too, regard the Logos—that is, the Word and Reason—as the Creator of the universe.
For Zeno lays it down that he is the creator, having made all things according to a determinate
plan; that his name is Fate, and God, and the soul of Jupiter, and the necessity of all
things. Cleanthes ascribes all this to spirit, which he maintains pervades the universe. And
we, in like manner, hold that the Word, and Reason, and Power, by which we have said God
made all, have spirit as their proper and essential substratum, in which the Word has in
being to give forth utterances, and reason abides to dispose and arrange, and power is over
all to execute. We have been taught that He proceeds forth from God, and in that procession
He is generated; so that He is the Son of God, and is called God from unity of substance
with God. For God, too, is a Spirit. Even when the ray is shot from the sun, it is still part of
the parent mass; the sun will still be in the ray, because it is a ray of the sun—there is no division
of substance, but merely an extension. Thus Christ is Spirit of Spirit, and God of
God, as light of light is kindled.105 The material matrix remains entire and unimpaired,
though you derive from it any number of shoots possessed of its qualities; so, too, that which
has come forth out of God is at once God and the Son of God, and the two are one. In this
way also, as He is Spirit of Spirit and God of God, He is made a second in manner of existence—
in position, not in nature; and He did not withdraw from the original source, but
went forth. This ray of God, then, as it was always foretold in ancient times, descending
into a certain virgin, and made flesh in her womb, is in His birth God and man united. The
flesh formed by the Spirit is nourished, grows up to manhood, speaks, teaches, works, and
is the Christ. Receive meanwhile this fable, if you choose to call it so—it is like some of your
own—while we go on to show how Christ’s claims are proved, and who the parties are with
you by whom such fables have been set a going to overthrow the truth, which they resemble.
The Jews, too, were well aware that Christ was coming, as those to whom the prophets spake.
Nay, even now His advent is expected by them; nor is there any other contention between
them and us, than that they believe the advent has not yet occurred. For two comings of
Christ having been revealed to us: a first, which has been fulfilled in the lowliness of a human
lot; a second, which impends over the world, now near its close, in all the majesty of Deity
unveiled; and, by misunderstanding the first, they have concluded that the second—which,
as matter of more manifest prediction, they set their hopes on—is the only one. It was the
merited punishment of their sin not to understand the Lord’s first advent: for if they had,
<note type="footnote">104 [That is, by the consummation of her marriage with Joseph.]</note>
<note type="footnote">105 [Language common among Christians, and adopted afterwards into the Creed.]</note>

<pb n="62"/>
they would have believed; and if they had believed, they would have obtained salvation.
They themselves read how it is written of them that they are deprived of wisdom and understanding—
of the use of eyes and ears.106 As, then, under the force of their pre-judgment,
they had convinced themselves from His lowly guise that Christ was no more than man, it
followed from that, as a necessary consequence, that they should hold Him a magician from
the powers which He displayed,—expelling devils from men by a word, restoring vision to
the blind, cleansing the leprous, reinvigorating the paralytic, summoning the dead to life
again, making the very elements of nature obey Him, stilling the storms and walking on the
sea; proving that He was the Logos of God, that primordial first-begotten Word, accompanied
by power and reason, and based on Spirit,—that He who was now doing all things by His
word, and He who had done that of old, were one and the same. But the Jews were so exasperated
by His teaching, by which their rulers and chiefs were convicted of the truth, chiefly
because so many turned aside to Him, that at last they brought Him before Pontius Pilate,
at that time Roman governor of Syria; and, by the violence of their outcries against Him,
extorted a sentence giving Him up to them to be crucified. He Himself had predicted this;
which, however, would have signified little had not the prophets of old done it as well. And
yet, nailed upon the cross, He exhibited many notable signs, by which His death was distinguished
from all others. At His own free-will, He with a word dismissed from Him His
spirit, anticipating the executioner’s work. In the same hour, too, the light of day was withdrawn,
when the sun at the very time was in his meridian blaze. Those who were not aware
that this had been predicted about Christ, no doubt thought it an eclipse. You yourselves
have the account of the world-portent still in your archives.107 Then, when His body was
taken down from the cross and placed in a sepulchre, the Jews in their eager watchfulness
surrounded it with a large military guard, lest, as He had predicted His resurrection from
the dead on the third day, His disciples might remove by stealth His body, and deceive even
the incredulous. But, lo, on the third day there a was a sudden shock of earthquake, and the
stone which sealed the sepulchre was rolled away, and the guard fled off in terror: without
a single disciple near, the grave was found empty of all but the clothes of the buried One.
But nevertheless, the leaders of the Jews, whom it nearly concerned both to spread abroad
a lie, and keep back a people tributary and submissive to them from the faith, gave it out
that the body of Christ had been stolen by His followers. For the Lord, you see, did not go
forth into the public gaze, lest the wicked should be delivered from their error; that faith
also, destined to a great reward, might hold its ground in difficulty. But He spent forty days
with some of His disciples down in Galilee, a region of Judea, instructing them in the doctrines
they were to teach to others. Thereafter, having given them commission to preach
<note type="footnote">106 Isa. vi. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">107 Elucidation V.</note>

<pb n="63"/>
the gospel through the world, He was encompassed with a cloud and taken up to heaven,—a
fact more certain far than the assertions of your Proculi concerning Romulus.108 All these
things Pilate did to Christ; and now in fact a Christian in his own convictions, he sent word
of Him to the reigning Cæsar, who was at the time Tiberius. Yes, and the Cæsars too would
have believed on Christ, if either the Cæsars had not been necessary for the world, or if
Christians could have been Cæsars. His disciples also, spreading over the world, did as their
Divine Master bade them; and after suffering greatly themselves from the persecutions of
the Jews, and with no unwilling heart, as having faith undoubting in the truth, at last by
Nero’s cruel sword sowed the seed of Christian blood at Rome.109 Yes, and we shall prove
that even your own gods are effective witnesses for Christ. It is a great matter if, to give you
faith in Christians, I can bring forward the authority of the very beings on account of whom
you refuse them credit. Thus far we have carried out the plan we laid down. We have set
forth this origin of our sect and name, with this account of the Founder of Christianity. Let
no one henceforth charge us with infamous wickedness; let no one think that it is otherwise
than we have represented, for none may give a false account of his religion. For in the very
fact that he says he worships another god than he really does, he is guilty of denying the
object of his worship, and transferring his worship and homage to another; and, in the
transference, he ceases to worship the god he has repudiated. We say, and before all men
we say, and torn and bleeding under your tortures, we cry out, “We worship God through
Christ.” Count Christ a man, if you please; by Him and in Him God would be known and
be adored. If the Jews object, we answer that Moses, who was but a man, taught them their
religion; against the Greeks we urge that Orpheus at Pieria, Musæus at Athens, Melampus
at Argos, Trophonius in Boeotia, imposed religious rites; turning to yourselves, who exercise
sway over the nations, it was the man Numa Pompilius who laid on the Romans a heavy
load of costly superstitions. Surely Christ, then, had a right to reveal Deity, which was in
fact His own essential possession, not with the object of bringing boors and savages by the
dread of multitudinous gods, whose favour must be won into some civilization, as was the
case with Numa; but as one who aimed to enlighten men already civilized, and under illusions
from their very culture, that they might come to the knowledge of the truth. Search, then,
and see if that divinity of Christ be true. If it be of such a nature that the acceptance of it
transforms a man, and makes him truly good, there is implied in that the duty of renouncing
what is opposed to it as false; especially and on every ground that which, hiding itself under
the names and images of dead, the labours to convince men of its divinity by certain signs,
and miracles, and oracles.</p>

<p>And we affirm indeed the existence of certain spiritual essences; nor is their name unfamiliar.
The philosophers acknowledge there are demons; Socrates himself waiting on a demon’s
will. Why not? since it is said an evil spirit attached itself specially to him even from
his childhood—turning his mind no doubt from what was good. The poets are all acquainted
with demons too; even the ignorant common people make frequent use of them in cursing.
In fact, they call upon Satan, the demon-chief, in their execrations, as though from some
instinctive soul-knowledge of him. Plato also admits the existence of angels. The dealers in
magic, no less, come forward as witnesses to the existence of both kinds of spirits. We are
instructed, moreover, by our sacred books how from certain angels, who fell of their own
free-will, there sprang a more wicked demon-brood, condemned of God along with the
authors of their race, and that chief we have referred to. It will for the present be enough,
however, that some account is given of their work. Their great business is the ruin of
mankind. So, from the very first, spiritual wickedness sought our destruction. They inflict,
accordingly, upon our bodies diseases and other grievous calamities, while by violent assaults
they hurry the soul into sudden and extraordinary excesses. Their marvellous subtleness
and tenuity give them access to both parts of our nature. As spiritual, they can do no harm;
for, invisible and intangible, we are not cognizant of their action save by its effects, as when
some inexplicable, unseen poison in the breeze blights the apples and the grain while in the
flower, or kills them in the bud, or destroys them when they have reached maturity; as
though by the tainted atmosphere in some unknown way spreading abroad its pestilential
exhalations. So, too, by an influence equally obscure, demons and angels breathe into the
soul, and rouse up its corruptions with furious passions and vile excesses; or with cruel lusts
accompanied by various errors, of which the worst is that by which these deities are commended
to the favour of deceived and deluded human beings, that they may get their
proper food of flesh-fumes and blood when that is offered up to idol-images. What is daintier
food to the spirit of evil, than turning men’s minds away from the true God by the illusions
of a false divination? And here I explain how these illusions are managed. Every spirit
is possessed of wings. This is a common property of both angels and demons. So they are
everywhere in a single moment; the whole world is as one place to them; all that is done
over the whole extent of it, it is as easy for them to know as to report. Their swiftness of
motion is taken for divinity, because their nature is unknown. Thus they would have
themselves thought sometimes the authors of the things which they announce; and sometimes,
no doubt, the bad things are their doing, never the good. The purposes of God, too,
they took up of old from the lips of the prophets, even as they spoke them; and they gather
them still from their works, when they hear them read aloud. Thus getting, too, from this
source some intimations of the future, they set themselves up as rivals of the true God, while
they steal His divinations. But the skill with which their responses are shaped to meet events,

your Croesi and Pyrrhi know too well. On the other hand, it was in that way we have explained,
the Pythian was able to declare that they were cooking a tortoise110 with the flesh
of a lamb; in a moment he had been to Lydia. From dwelling in the air, and their nearness
to the stars, and their commerce with the clouds, they have means of knowing the preparatory
processes going on in these upper regions, and thus can give promise of the rains which
they already feel. Very kind too, no doubt, they are in regard to the healing of diseases. For,
first of all, they make you ill; then, to get a miracle out of it, they command the application
of remedies either altogether new, or contrary to those in use, and straightway withdrawing
hurtful influence, they are supposed to have wrought a cure. What need, then, to speak of
their other artifices, or yet further of the deceptive power which they have as spirits: of these
Castor apparitions,111 of water carried by a sieve, and a ship drawn along by a girdle, and
a beard reddened by a touch, all done with the one object of showing that men should believe
in the deity of stones, and not seek after the only true God?</p>

<p>Moreover, if sorcerers call forth ghosts, and even make what seem the souls of the dead
to appear; if they put boys to death, in order to get a response from the oracle; if, with their
juggling illusions, they make a pretence of doing various miracles; if they put dreams into
people’s minds by the power of the angels and demons whose aid they have invited, by
whose influence, too, goats and tables are made to divine,—how much more likely is this
power of evil to be zealous in doing with all its might, of its own inclination, and for its own
objects, what it does to serve the ends of others! Or if both angels and demons do just what
your gods do, where in that case is the pre-eminence of deity, which we must surely think
to be above all in might? Will it not then be more reasonable to hold that these spirits make
themselves gods, giving as they do the very proofs which raise your gods to godhead, than
that the gods are the equals of angels and demons? You make a distinction of places, I suppose,
regarding as gods in their temple those whose divinity you do not recognize elsewhere;
counting the madness which leads one man to leap from the sacred houses, to be something
different from that which leads another to leap from an adjoining house; looking on one
who cuts his arms and secret parts as under a different furor from another who cuts his
throat. The result of the frenzy is the same, and the manner of instigation is one. But thus
far we have been dealing only in words: we now proceed to a proof of facts, in which we
shall show that under different names you have real identity. Let a person be brought before
your tribunals, who is plainly under demoniacal possession. The wicked spirit, bidden to
speak by a follower of Christ,112 will as readily make the truthful confession that he is a demon,
as elsewhere he has falsely asserted that he is a god. Or, if you will, let there be produced
one of the god-possessed, as they are supposed, who, inhaling at the altar, conceive divinity
from the fumes, who are delivered of it by retching, who vent it forth in agonies of gasping.
Let that same Virgin Cælestis herself the rain-promiser, let Æsculapius discoverer of medicines,
ready to prolong the life of Socordius, and Tenatius, and Asclepiodotus, now in the
last extremity, if they would not confess, in their fear of lying to a Christian, that they were
demons, then and there shed the blood of that most impudent follower of Christ. What
clearer than a work like that? what more trustworthy than such a proof? The simplicity of
truth is thus set forth; its own worth sustains it; no ground remains for the least suspicion.
Do you say that it is done by magic, or some trick of that sort? You will not say anything of
the sort, if you have been allowed the use of your ears and eyes. For what argument can you
bring against a thing that is exhibited to the eye in its naked reality? If, on the one hand,
they are really gods, why do they pretend to be demons? Is it from fear of us? In that case
your divinity is put in subjection to Christians; and you surely can never ascribe deity to
that which is under authority of man, nay (if it adds aught to the disgrace) of its very enemies.
<note type="footnote">112 [This testimony must be noted as something of which Tertullian confidently challenges denial.]</note>

<pb n="67"/>
If, on the other hand, they are demons or angels, why, inconsistently with this, do they
presume to set themselves forth as acting the part of gods? For as beings who put themselves
out as gods would never willingly call themselves demons, if they were gods indeed, that
they might not thereby in fact abdicate their dignity; so those whom you know to be no
more than demons, would not dare to act as gods, if those whose names they take and use
were really divine. For they would not dare to treat with disrespect the higher majesty of
beings, whose displeasure they would feel was to be dreaded. So this divinity of yours is no
divinity; for if it were, it would not be pretended to by demons, and it would not be denied
by gods. But since on both sides there is a concurrent acknowledgment that they are not
gods, gather from this that there is but a single race—I mean the race of demons, the real
race in both cases. Let your search, then, now be after gods; for those whom you had imagined
to be so you find to be spirits of evil. The truth is, as we have thus not only shown
from our own gods that neither themselves nor any others have claims to deity, you may
see at once who is really God, and whether that is He and He alone whom we Christians
own; as also whether you are to believe in Him, and worship Him, after the manner of our
Christian faith and discipline. But at once they will say, Who is this Christ with his fables?
is he an ordinary man? is he a sorcerer? was his body stolen by his disciples from its tomb?
is he now in the realms below? or is he not rather up in the heavens, thence about to come
again, making the whole world shake, filling the earth with dread alarms, making all but
Christians wail—as the Power of God, and the Spirit of God, as the Word, the Reason, the
Wisdom, and the Son of God? Mock as you like, but get the demons if you can to join you
in your mocking; let them deny that Christ is coming to judge every human soul which has
existed from the world’s beginning, clothing it again with the body it laid aside at death; let
them declare it, say, before your tribunal, that this work has been allotted to Minos and
Rhadamanthus, as Plato and the poets agree; let them put away from them at least the mark
of ignominy and condemnation. They disclaim being unclean spirits, which yet we must
hold as indubitably proved by their relish for the blood and fumes and foetid carcasses of
sacrificial animals, and even by the vile language of their ministers. Let them deny that, for
their wickedness condemned already, they are kept for that very judgment-day, with all
their worshippers and their works. Why, all the authority and power we have over them is
from our naming the name of Christ, and recalling to their memory the woes with which
God threatens them at the hands of Christ as Judge, and which they expect one day to
overtake them. Fearing Christ in God, and God in Christ, they become subject to the servants
of God and Christ. So at our touch and breathing, overwhelmed by the thought and realization
of those judgment fires, they leave at our command the bodies they have entered,
unwilling, and distressed, and before your very eyes put to an open shame. You believe them
when they lie; give credit to them, then, when they speak the truth about themselves. No
one plays the liar to bring disgrace upon his own head, but for the sake of honour rather.

You give a readier confidence to people making confessions against themselves, than denials
in their own behalf. It has not been an unusual thing, accordingly, for those testimonies of
your deities to convert men to Christianity; for in giving full belief to them, we are led to
believe in Christ. Yes, your very gods kindle up faith in our Scriptures, they build up the
confidence of our hope. You do homage, as I know, to them also with the blood of Christians.
On no account, then, would they lose those who are so useful and dutiful to them, anxious
even to hold you fast, lest some day or other as Christians you might put them to the rout,—if
under the power of a follower of Christ, who desires to prove to you the Truth, it were at
all possible for them to lie.</p>

<p>This whole confession of these beings, in which they declare that they are not gods, and
in which they tell you that there is no God but one, the God whom we adore, is quite sufficient
to clear us from the crime of treason, chiefly against the Roman religion. For if it is certain
the gods have no existence, there is no religion in the case. If there is no religion, because
there are no gods, we are assuredly not guilty of any offence against religion. Instead of that,
the charge recoils on your own head: worshipping a lie, you are really guilty of the crime
you charge on us, not merely by refusing the true religion of the true God, but by going the
further length of persecuting it. But now, granting that these objects of your worship are
really gods, is it not generally held that there is one higher and more potent, as it were the
world’s chief ruler, endowed with absolute power and majesty? For the common way is to
apportion deity, giving an imperial and supreme domination to one, while its offices are
put into the hands of many, as Plato describes great Jupiter in the heavens, surrounded by
an array at once of deities and demons. It behooves us, therefore, to show equal respect to
the procurators, prefects, and governors of the divine empire. And yet how great a crime
does he commit, who, with the object of gaining higher favour with the Cæsar, transfers his
endeavours and his hopes to another, and does not confess that the appellation of God as
of Emperor belongs only to the Supreme Head, when it is held a capital offence among us
to call, or hear called, by the highest title any other than Cæsar himself! Let one man worship
God, another Jupiter; let one lift suppliant hands to the heavens, another to the altar of Fides;
let one—if you choose to take this view of it—count in prayer the clouds, and another the
ceiling panels; let one consecrate his own life to his God, and another that of a goat. For see
that you do not give a further ground for the charge of irreligion, by taking away religious
liberty,113 and forbidding free choice of deity, so that I may no longer worship according
to my inclination, but am compelled to worship against it. Not even a human being would
care to have unwilling homage rendered him; and so the very Egyptians have been permitted
the legal use of their ridiculous superstition, liberty to make gods of birds and beasts, nay,
to condemn to death any one who kills a god of their sort. Every province even, and every
city, has its god. Syria has Astarte, Arabia has Dusares, the Norici have Belenus, Africa has
its Cælestis, Mauritania has its own princes. I have spoken, I think, of Roman provinces,
and yet I have not said their gods are Roman; for they are not worshipped at Rome any more
than others who are ranked as deities over Italy itself by municipal consecration, such as
Delventinus of Casinum, Visidianus of Narnia, Ancharia of Asculum, Nortia of Volsinii,
Valentia of Ocriculum, Hostia of Satrium, Father Curis of Falisci, in honour of whom, too,
Juno got her surname. In, fact, we alone are prevented having a religion of our own. We
113 [Observe our author’s assertion that in its own nature, worship must be a voluntary act, and note this
expression libertatem religionis.]

<pb n="70"/>
give offence to the Romans, we are excluded from the rights and privileges of Romans, because
we do not worship the gods of Rome. It is well that there is a God of all, whose we all
are, whether we will or no. But with you liberty is given to worship any god but the true
God, as though He were not rather the God all should worship, to whom all belong.</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.</head>
<p>I think I have offered sufficient proof upon the question of false and true divinity, having
shown that the proof rests not merely on debate and argument, but on the witness of the
very beings whom you believe are gods, so that the point needs no further handling. However,
having been led thus naturally to speak of the Romans, I shall not avoid the controversy
which is invited by the groundless assertion of those who maintain that, as a reward of their
singular homage to religion, the Romans have been raised to such heights of power as to
have become masters of the world; and that so certainly divine are the beings they worship,
that those prosper beyond all others, who beyond all others honour them.114 This, forsooth,
is the wages the gods have paid the Romans for their devotion. The progress of the empire
is to be ascribed to Sterculus, the Mutunus, and Larentina! For I can hardly think that foreign
gods would have been disposed to show more favour to an alien race than to their own, and
given their own fatherland, in which they had their birth, grew up to manhood, became illustrious,
and at last were buried, over to invaders from another shore! As for Cybele, if she
set her affections on the city of Rome as sprung of the Trojan stock saved from the arms of
Greece, she herself forsooth being of the same race,—if she foresaw her transference115 to
the avenging people by whom Greece the conqueror of Phrygia was to be subdued, let her
look to it (in regard of her native country’s conquest by Greece). Why, too, even in these
days the Mater Magna has given a notable proof of her greatness which she has conferred
as a boon upon the city; when, after the loss to the State of Marcus Aurelius at Sirmium, on
the sixteenth before the Kalends of April, that most sacred high priest of hers was offering,
a week after, impure libations of blood drawn from his own arms, and issuing his commands
that the ordinary prayers should be made for the safety of the emperor already dead. O tardy
messengers! O sleepy despatches! through whose fault Cybele had not an earlier knowledge
of the imperial decease, that the Christians might have no occasion to ridicule a goddess so
unworthy. Jupiter, again, would surely never have permitted his own Crete to fall at once
before the Roman Fasces, forgetful of that Idean cave and the Corybantian cymbals, and
the sweet odour of her who nursed him there. Would he not have exalted his own tomb
above the entire Capitol, that the land which covered the ashes of Jove might rather be the
mistress of the world? Would Juno have desired the destruction of the Punic city, beloved
even to the neglect of Samos, and that by a nation of Æneadæ? As to that I know, “Here
were her arms, here was her chariot, this kingdom, if the Fates permit, the goddess tends
and cherishes to be mistress of the nations.”116 Jove’s hapless wife and sister had no power
to prevail against the Fates! “Jupiter himself is sustained by fate.” And yet the Romans have
<note type="footnote">114 [See Augustine’s City of God, III. xvii. p. 95, Ed. Migne.]</note>
<note type="footnote">115 Her image was taken from Pessinus to Rome.</note>
<note type="footnote">116 [Familiar reference to Virgil, Æneid, I. 15.]</note>

<pb n="72"/>
never done such homage to the Fates, which gave them Carthage against the purpose and
the will of Juno, as to the abandoned harlot Larentina. It is undoubted that not a few of your
gods have reigned on earth as kings. If, then, they now possess the power of bestowing empire,
when they were kings themselves, from whence had they received their kingly honours?
Whom did Jupiter and Saturn worship? A Sterculus, I suppose. But did the Romans, along
with the native-born inhabitants, afterwards adore also some who were never kings? In that
case, however, they were under the reign of others, who did not yet bow down to them, as
not yet raised to godhead. It belongs to others, then, to make gift of kingdoms, since there
were kings before these gods had their names on the roll of divinities. But how utterly foolish
it is to attribute the greatness of the Roman name to religious merits, since it was after Rome
became an empire, or call it still a kingdom, that the religion she professes made its chief
progress! Is it the case now? Has its religion been the source of the prosperity of Rome?
Though Numa set agoing an eagerness after superstitious observances, yet religion among
the Romans was not yet a matter of images or temples. It was frugal in its ways, its rites were
simple, and there were no capitols struggling to the heavens; but the altars were offhand
ones of turf, and the sacred vessels were yet of Samian earthen-ware, and from these the
odours rose, and no likeness of God was to be seen. For at that time the skill of the Greeks
and Tuscans in image-making had not yet overrun the city with the products of their art.
The Romans, therefore, were not distinguished for their devotion to the gods before they
attained to greatness; and so their greatness was not the result of their religion. Indeed, how
could religion make a people great who have owed their greatness to their irreligion? For,
if I am not mistaken, kingdoms and empires are acquired by wars, and are extended by
victories. More than that, you cannot have wars and victories without the taking, and often
the destruction, of cities. That is a thing in which the gods have their share of calamity.
Houses and temples suffer alike; there is indiscriminate slaughter of priests and citizens;
the hand of rapine is laid equally upon sacred and on common treasure. Thus the sacrileges
of the Romans are as numerous as their trophies. They boast as many triumphs over the
gods as over the nations; as many spoils of battle they have still, as there remain images of
captive deities. And the poor gods submit to be adored by their enemies, and they ordain
illimitable empire to those whose injuries rather than their simulated homage should have
had retribution at their hands. But divinities unconscious are with impunity dishonoured,
just as in vain they are adored. You certainly never can believe that devotion to religion has
evidently advanced to greatness a people who, as we have put it, have either grown by injuring
religion, or have injured religion by their growth. Those, too, whose kingdoms have become
part of the one great whole of the Roman empire, were not without religion when their
kingdoms were taken from them.</p>

<p>Examine then, and see if He be not the dispenser of kingdoms, who is Lord at once of
the world which is ruled, and of man himself who rules; if He have not ordained the changes
of dynasties, with their appointed seasons, who was before all time, and made the world a
body of times; if the rise and the fall of states are not the work of Him, under whose sovereignty
the human race once existed without states at all. How do you allow yourselves to
fall into such error? Why, the Rome of rural simplicity is older than some of her gods; she
reigned before her proud, vast Capitol was built. The Babylonians exercised dominion, too,
before the days of the Pontiffs; and the Medes before the Quindecemvirs; and the Egyptians
before the Salii; and the Assyrians before the Luperci; and the Amazons before the Vestal
Virgins. And to add another point: if the religions of Rome give empire, ancient Judea would
never have been a kingdom, despising as it did one and all these idol deities; Judea, whose
God you Romans once honoured with victims, and its temple with gifts, and its people with
treaties; and which would never have been beneath your sceptre but for that last and
crowning offence against God, in rejecting and crucifying Christ.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVII.</head>
<p>Enough has been said in these remarks to confute the charge of treason against your re
ligion: for we cannot be held to do harm to that which has no existence. When we are called
therefore to sacrifice, we resolutely refuse, relying on the knowledge we possess, by which
we are well assured of the real objects to whom these services are offered, under profaning
of images and the deification of human names. Some, indeed, think it a piece of insanity
that, when it is in our power to offer sacrifice at once, and go away unharmed, holding as
ever our convictions, we prefer an obstinate persistence in our confession to our safety. You
advise us, forsooth, to take unjust advantage of you; but we know whence such suggestions
come, who is at the bottom of it all, and how every effort is made, now by cunning suasion,
and now by merciless persecution, to overthrow our constancy. No other than that spirit,
half devil and half angel, who, hating us because of his own separation from God, and stirred
with envy for the favour God has shown us, turns your minds against us by an occult influence,
moulding and instigating them to all that perversity in judgment, and that unrighteous
cruelty, which we have mentioned at the beginning of our work, when entering on this discussion.
For, though the whole power of demons and kindred spirits is subject to us, yet
still, as ill-disposed slaves sometimes conjoin contumacy with fear, and delight to injure
those of whom they at the same time stand in awe, so is it here. For fear also inspires hatred.
Besides, in their desperate condition, as already under condemnation, it gives them some
comfort, while punishment delays, to have the usufruct of their malignant dispositions. And
yet, when hands are laid on them, they are subdued at once, and submit to their lot; and
those whom at a distance they oppose, in close quarters they supplicate for mercy. So when,
like insurrectionary workhouses, or prisons, or mines, or any such penal slaveries, they
break forth against us their masters, they know all the while that they are not a match for
us, and just on that account, indeed, rush the more recklessly to destruction. We resist them,
unwillingly, as though they were equals, and contend against them by persevering in that
which they assail; and our triumph over them is never more complete than when we are
condemned for resolute adherence to our faith.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="28">
<pb n="75"/>
<head>Chapter XXVIII.</head>
<p>But as it was easily seen to be unjust to compel freemen against their will to offer sacrifice
(for even in other acts of religious service a willing mind is required), it should be counted
quite absurd for one man to compel another to do honour to the gods, when he ought ever
voluntarily, and in the sense of his own need, to seek their favour, lest in the liberty which
is his right he should be ready to say, “I want none of Jupiter’s favours; pray who art thou?
Let Janus meet me with angry looks, with whichever of his faces he likes; what have you to
do with me?” You have been led, no doubt, by these same evil spirits to compel us to offer
sacrifice for the well-being of the emperor; and you are under a necessity of using force, just
as we are under an obligation to face the dangers of it. This brings us, then, to the second
ground of accusation, that we are guilty of treason against a majesty more august; for you
do homage with a greater dread and an intenser reverence to Cæsar, than Olympian Jove
himself. And if you knew it, upon sufficient grounds. For is not any living man better than
a dead one, whoever he be? But this is not done by you on any other ground than regard to
a power whose presence you vividly realize; so that also in this you are convicted of impiety
to your gods, inasmuch as you show a greater reverence to a human sovereignty than you
do to them. Then, too, among you, people far more readily swear a false oath in the name
of all the gods, than in the name of the single genius of Cæsar.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="29">
<pb n="76"/>
<head>Chapter XXIX.</head>
<p>Let it be made clear, then, first of all, if those to whom sacrifice is offered are really able
to protect either emperor or anybody else, and so adjudge us guilty of treason, if angels and
demons, spirits of most wicked nature, do any good, if the lost save, if the condemned give
liberty, if the dead (I refer to what you know well enough) defend the living. For surely the
first thing they would look to would be the protection of their statues, and images, and
temples, which rather owe their safety, I think, to the watch kept by Cæsar’s guards. Nay, I
think the very materials of which these are made come from Cæsar’s mines, and there is
not a temple but depends on Cæsar’s will. Yes, and many gods have felt the displeasure of
the Cæsar. It makes for my argument if they are also partakers of his favour, when he bestows
on them some gift or privilege. How shall they who are thus in Cæsar’s power, who belong
entirely to him, have Cæsar’s protection in their hands, so that you can imagine them able
to give to Cæsar what they more readily get from him? This, then, is the ground on which
we are charged with treason against the imperial majesty, to wit, that we do not put the
emperors under their own possessions; that we do not offer a mere mock service on their
behalf, as not believing their safety rests in leaden hands. But you are impious in a high degree
who look for it where it is not, who seek it from those who have it not to give, passing by
Him who has it entirely in His power. Besides this, you persecute those who know where
to seek for it, and who, knowing where to seek for it, are able as well to secure it.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="30">
<pb n="77"/>
<head>Chapter XXX.</head>
<p>For we offer prayer for the safety of our princes to the eternal, the true, the living God,
whose favour, beyond all others, they must themselves desire. They know from whom they
have obtained their power; they know, as they are men, from whom they have received life
itself; they are convinced that He is God alone, on whose power alone they are entirely dependent,
to whom they are second, after whom they occupy the highest places, before and
above all the gods. Why not, since they are above all living men, and the living, as living,
are superior to the dead? They reflect upon the extent of their power, and so they come to
understand the highest; they acknowledge that they have all their might from Him against
whom their might is nought. Let the emperor make war on heaven; let him lead heaven
captive in his triumph; let him put guards on heaven; let him impose taxes on heaven! He
cannot. Just because he is less than heaven, he is great. For he himself is His to whom
heaven and every creature appertains. He gets his sceptre where he first got his humanity;
his power where he got the breath of life. Thither we lift our eyes, with hands outstretched,
because free from sin; with head uncovered, for we have nothing whereof to be ashamed;
finally, without a monitor, because it is from the heart we supplicate. Without ceasing, for
all our emperors we offer prayer. We pray for life prolonged; for security to the empire; for
protection to the imperial house; for brave armies, a faithful senate, a virtuous people, the
world at rest, whatever, as man or Cæsar, an emperor would wish. These things I cannot
ask from any but the God from whom I know I shall obtain them, both because He alone
bestows them and because I have claims upon Him for their gift, as being a servant of His,
rendering homage to Him alone, persecuted for His doctrine, offering to Him, at His own
requirement, that costly and noble sacrifice of prayer117 despatched from the chaste body,
an unstained soul, a sanctified spirit, not the few grains of incense a farthing buys118—tears
of an Arabian tree,—not a few drops of wine,—not the blood of some worthless ox to which
death is a relief, and, in addition to other offensive things, a polluted conscience, so that one
wonders, when your victims are examined by these vile priests, why the examination is not
rather of the sacrificers than the sacrifices. With our hands thus stretched out and up to
God, rend us with your iron claws, hang us up on crosses, wrap us in flames, take our heads
from us with the sword, let loose the wild beasts on us,—the very attitude of a Christian
praying is one of preparation for all punishment.119 Let this, good rulers, be your work:

<p>But we merely, you say, flatter the emperor, and feign these prayers of ours to escape
persecution. Thank you for your mistake, for you give us the opportunity of proving our
allegations. Do you, then, who think that we care nothing for the welfare of Cæsar, look
into God’s revelations, examine our sacred books, which we do not keep in hiding, and
which many accidents put into the hands of those who are not of us. Learn from them that
a large benevolence is enjoined upon us, even so far as to supplicate God for our enemies,
and to beseech blessings on our persecutors.120 Who, then, are greater enemies and persecutors
of Christians, than the very parties with treason against whom we are charged? Nay,
even in terms, and most clearly, the Scripture says, “Pray for kings, and rulers, and powers,
that all may be peace with you.”121 For when there is disturbance in the empire, if the
commotion is felt by its other members, surely we too, though we are not thought to be
given to disorder, are to be found in some place or other which the calamity affects.</p>

<p>There is also another and a greater necessity for our offering prayer in behalf of the
emperors, nay, for the complete stability of the empire, and for Roman interests in general.
For we know that a mighty shock impending over the whole earth—in fact, the very end of
all things threatening dreadful woes—is only retarded by the continued existence of the
Roman empire.122 We have no desire, then, to be overtaken by these dire events; and in
praying that their coming may be delayed, we are lending our aid to Rome’s duration. More
than this, though we decline to swear by the genii of the Cæsars, we swear by their safety,
which is worth far more than all your genii. Are you ignorant that these genii are called
“Dæmones,” and thence the diminutive name “Dæmonia” is applied to them? We respect
in the emperors the ordinance of God, who has set them over the nations. We know that
there is that in them which God has willed; and to what God has willed we desire all safety,
and we count an oath by it a great oath. But as for demons, that is, your genii, we have been
in the habit of exorcising them, not of swearing by them, and thereby conferring on them
divine honour.</p>

<p>But why dwell longer on the reverence and sacred respect of Christians to the emperor,
whom we cannot but look up to as called by our Lord to his office? So that on valid grounds
I might say Cæsar is more ours than yours, for our God has appointed him. Therefore, as
having this propriety in him, I do more than you for his welfare, not merely because I ask
it of Him who can give it, or because I ask it as one who deserves to get it, but also because,
in keeping the majesty of Cæsar within due limits, and putting it under the Most High, and
making it less than divine, I commend him the more to the favour of Deity, to whom I make
him alone inferior. But I place him in subjection to one I regard as more glorious than
himself. Never will I call the emperor God, and that either because it is not in me to be
guilty of falsehood; or that I dare not turn him into ridicule; or that not even himself will
desire to have that high name applied to him. If he is but a man, it is his interest as man to
give God His higher place. Let him think it enough to bear the name of emperor. That, too,
is a great name of God’s giving. To call him God, is to rob him of his title. If he is not a man,
emperor he cannot be. Even when, amid the honours of a triumph, he sits on that lofty
chariot, he is reminded that he is only human. A voice at his back keeps whispering in his
ear, “Look behind thee; remember thou art but a man.” And it only adds to his exultation,
that he shines with a glory so surpassing as to require an admonitory reference to his condition.
123 It adds to his greatness that he needs such a reminiscence, lest he should think
himself divine.</p>

<p>Augustus, the founder of the empire, would not even have the title Lord; for that, too,
is a name of Deity. For my part, I am willing to give the emperor this designation, but in
the common acceptation of the word, and when I am not forced to call him Lord as in God’s
place. But my relation to him is one of freedom; for I have but one true Lord, the God omnipotent
and eternal, who is Lord of the emperor as well. How can he, who is truly father
of his country, be its lord? The name of piety is more grateful than the name of power; so
the heads of families are called fathers rather than lords. Far less should the emperor have
the name of God. We can only profess our belief that he is that by the most unworthy, nay,
a fatal flattery; it is just as if, having an emperor, you call another by the name, in which case
will you not give great and unappeasable offence to him who actually reigns?—an offence
he, too, needs to fear on whom you have bestowed the title. Give all reverence to God, if
you wish Him to be propitious to the emperor. Give up all worship of, and belief in, any
other being as divine. Cease also to give the sacred name to him who has need of God himself.
If such adulation is not ashamed of its lie, in addressing a man as divine, let it have some
dread at least of the evil omen which it bears. It is the invocation of a curse, to give Cæsar
the name of god before his apotheosis.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXV.</head>
<p>This is the reason, then, why Christians are counted public enemies: that they pay no
vain, nor false, nor foolish honours to the emperor; that, as men believing in the true religion,
they prefer to celebrate their festal days with a good conscience, instead of with the common
wantonness. It is, forsooth, a notable homage to bring fires and couches out before the
public, to have feasting from street to street, to turn the city into one great tavern, to make
mud with wine, to run in troops to acts of violence, to deeds of shamelessness to lust allurements!
What! is public joy manifested by public disgrace? Do things unseemly at other times
beseem the festal days of princes? Do they who observe the rules of virtue out of reverence
for Cæsar, for his sake turn aside from them? Shall piety be a license to immoral deeds, and
shall religion be regarded as affording the occasion for all riotous extravagance? Poor we,
worthy of all condemnation! For why do we keep the votive days and high rejoicings in
honour of the Cæsars with chastity, sobriety, and virtue? Why, on the day of gladness, do
we neither cover our door-posts with laurels, nor intrude upon the day with lamps? It is a
proper thing, at the call of a public festivity, to dress your house up like some new brothel.124
However, in the matter of this homage to a lesser majesty, in reference to which we are accused
of a lower sacrilege, because we do not celebrate along with you the holidays of the
Cæsars in a manner forbidden alike by modesty, decency, and purity,—in truth they have
been established rather as affording opportunities for licentiousness than from any worthy
motive;—in this matter I am anxious to point out how faithful and true you are, lest perchance
here also those who will not have us counted Romans, but enemies of Rome’s chief rulers,
be found themselves worse than we wicked Christians! I appeal to the inhabitants of Rome
themselves, to the native population of the seven hills: does that Roman vernacular of theirs
ever spare a Cæsar? The Tiber and the wild beasts’ schools bear witness. Say now if nature
had covered our hearts with a transparent substance through which the light could pass,
whose hearts, all graven over, would not betray the scene of another and another Cæsar
presiding at the distribution of a largess? And this at the very time they are shouting, “May
Jupiter take years from us, and with them lengthen like to you,”—words as foreign to the
lips of a Christian as it is out of keeping with his character to desire a change of emperor.
But this is the rabble, you say; yet, as the rabble, they still are Romans, and none more frequently
than they demand the death of Christians.125 Of course, then, the other classes, as
befits their higher rank, are religiously faithful. No breath of treason is there ever in the
senate, in the equestrian order, in the camp, in the palace. Whence, then, came a Cassius,
a Niger, an Albinus? Whence they who beset the Cæsar126 between the two laurel groves?

Whence they who practised wrestling, that they might acquire skill to strangle him? Whence
they who in full armour broke into the palace,127 more audacious than all your Tigerii and
Parthenii.128 If I mistake not, they were Romans; that is, they were not Christians. Yet all
of them, on the very eve of their traitorous outbreak, offered sacrifices for the safety of the
emperor, and swore by his genius, one thing in profession, and another in the heart; and
no doubt they were in the habit of calling Christians enemies of the state. Yes, and persons
who are now daily brought to light as confederates or approvers of these crimes and treasons,
the still remnant gleanings after a vintage of traitors, with what verdant and branching
laurels they clad their door-posts, with what lofty and brilliant lamps they smoked their
porches, with what most exquisite and gaudy couches they divided the Forum among
themselves; not that they might celebrate public rejoicings, but that they might get a foretaste
of their own votive seasons in partaking of the festivities of another, and inaugurate the
model and image of their hope, changing in their minds the emperor’s name. The same
homage is paid, dutifully too, by those who consult astrologers, and soothsayers, and augurs,
and magicians, about the life of the Cæsars,—arts which, as made known by the angels who
sinned, and forbidden by God, Christians do not even make use of in their own affairs. But
who has any occasion to inquire about the life of the emperor, if he have not some wish or
thought against it, or some hopes and expectations after it? For consultations of this sort
have not the same motive in the case of friends as in the case of sovereigns. The anxiety of
a kinsman is something very different from that of a subject.</p>

<p>If it is the fact that men bearing the name of Romans are found to be enemies of Rome,
why are we, on the ground that we are regarded as enemies, denied the name of Romans?
We may be at once Romans and foes of Rome, when men passing for Romans are discovered
to be enemies of their country. So the affection, and fealty, and reverence, due to the emperors
do not consist in such tokens of homage as these, which even hostility may be zealous
in performing, chiefly as a cloak to its purposes; but in those ways which Deity as certainly
enjoins on us, as they are held to be necessary in the case of all men as well as emperors.
Deeds of true heart-goodness are not due by us to emperors alone. We never do good with
respect of persons; for in our own interest we conduct ourselves as those who take no payment
either of praise or premium from man, but from God, who both requires and remunerates
an impartial benevolence.129 We are the same to emperors as to our ordinary neighbors.
For we are equally forbidden to wish ill, to do ill, to speak ill, to think ill of all men. The
thing we must not do to an emperor, we must not do to any one else: what we would not
do to anybody, a fortiori, perhaps we should not do to him whom God has been pleased so
highly to exalt.</p>

<p>If we are enjoined, then, to love our enemies, as I have remarked above, whom have we
to hate? If injured, we are forbidden to retaliate, lest we become as bad ourselves: who can
suffer injury at our hands? In regard to this, recall your own experiences. How often you
inflict gross cruelties on Christians, partly because it is your own inclination, and partly in
obedience to the laws! How often, too, the hostile mob, paying no regard to you, takes the
law into its own hand, and assails us with stones and flames! With the very frenzy of the
Bacchanals, they do not even spare the Christian dead, but tear them, now sadly changed,
no longer entire, from the rest of the tomb, from the asylum we might say of death, cutting
them in pieces, rending them asunder. Yet, banded together as we are, ever so ready to sacrifice
our lives, what single case of revenge for injury are you able to point to, though, if it
were held right among us to repay evil by evil, a single night with a torch or two could
achieve an ample vengeance? But away with the idea of a sect divine avenging itself by human
fires, or shrinking from the sufferings in which it is tried. If we desired, indeed, to act the
part of open enemies, not merely of secret avengers, would there be any lacking in strength,
whether of numbers or resources? The Moors, the Marcomanni, the Parthians themselves,
or any single people, however great, inhabiting a distinct territory, and confined within its
own boundaries, surpasses, forsooth, in numbers, one spread over all the world! We are but
of yesterday, and we have filled every place among you—cities, islands, fortresses, towns,
market-places, the very camp, tribes, companies, palace, senate, forum,—we have left
nothing to you but the temples of your gods. For what wars should we not be fit, not eager,
even with unequal forces, we who so willingly yield ourselves to the sword, if in our religion
it were not counted better to be slain than to slay? Without arms even, and raising no insurrectionary
banner, but simply in enmity to you, we could carry on the contest with you by
an ill-willed severance alone. For if such multitudes of men were to break away from you,
and betake themselves to some remote corner of the world, why, the very loss of so many
citizens, whatever sort they were, would cover the empire with shame; nay, in the very forsaking,
vengeance would be inflicted. Why, you would be horror-struck at the solitude in
which you would find yourselves, at such an all-prevailing silence, and that stupor as of a
dead world. You would have to seek subjects to govern. You would have more enemies than
citizens remaining. For now it is the immense number of Christians which makes your enemies
so few,—almost all the inhabitants of your various cities being followers of Christ.130
Yet you choose to call us enemies of the human race, rather than of human error. Nay, who
would deliver you from those secret foes, ever busy both destroying your souls and ruining
your health? Who would save you, I mean, from the attacks of those spirits of evil, which
without reward or hire we exorcise? This alone would be revenge enough for us, that you
<note type="footnote">130 [Elucidation VI.]</note>

were henceforth left free to the possession of unclean spirits. But instead of taking into account
what is due to us for the important protection we afford you, and though we are not
merely no trouble to you, but in fact necessary to your well-being, you prefer to hold us
enemies, as indeed we are, yet not of man, but rather of his error.</p>

<p>Ought not Christians, therefore, to receive not merely a somewhat milder treatment,
but to have a place among the law-tolerated societies, seeing they are not chargeable with
any such crimes as are commonly dreaded from societies of the illicit class? For, unless I
mistake the matter, the prevention of such associations is based on a prudential regard to
public order, that the state may not be divided into parties, which would naturally lead to
disturbance in the electoral assemblies, the councils, the curiæ, the special conventions, even
in the public shows by the hostile collisions of rival parties; especially when now, in pursuit
of gain, men have begun to consider their violence an article to be bought and sold. But as
those in whom all ardour in the pursuit of glory and honour is dead, we have no pressing
inducement to take part in your public meetings; nor is there aught more entirely foreign
to us than affairs of state. We acknowledge one all-embracing commonwealth—the world.
We renounce all your spectacles, as strongly as we renounce the matters originating them,
which we know were conceived of superstition, when we give up the very things which are
the basis of their representations. Among us nothing is ever said, or seen, or heard, which
has anything in common with the madness of the circus, the immodesty of the theatre, the
atrocities of the arena, the useless exercises of the wrestling-ground. Why do you take offence
at us because we differ from you in regard to your pleasures? If we will not partake of your
enjoyments, the loss is ours, if there be loss in the case, not yours. We reject what pleases
you. You, on the other hand, have no taste for what is our delight. The Epicureans were
allowed by you to decide for themselves one true source of pleasure—I mean equanimity;
the Christian, on his part, has many such enjoyments—what harm in that?</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIX.</head>
<p>I shall at once go on, then, to exhibit the peculiarities of the Christian society, that, as I
have refuted the evil charged against it, I may point out its positive good.131 We are a body
knit together as such by a common religious profession, by unity of discipline, and by the
bond of a common hope. We meet together as an assembly and congregation, that, offering
up prayer to God as with united force, we may wrestle with Him in our supplications. This
violence God delights in. We pray, too, for the emperors, for their ministers and for all in
authority, for the welfare of the world, for the prevalence of peace, for the delay of the final
consummation.132 We assemble to read our sacred writings, if any peculiarity of the times
makes either forewarning or reminiscence needful.133 However it be in that respect, with
the sacred words we nourish our faith, we animate our hope, we make our confidence more
stedfast; and no less by inculcations of God’s precepts we confirm good habits. In the same
place also exhortations are made, rebukes and sacred censures are administered. For with
a great gravity is the work of judging carried on among us, as befits those who feel assured
that they are in the sight of God; and you have the most notable example of judgment to
come when any one has sinned so grievously as to require his severance from us in prayer,
in the congregation and in all sacred intercourse. The tried men of our elders preside over
us, obtaining that honour not by purchase, but by established character. There is no buying
and selling of any sort in the things of God. Though we have our treasure-chest, it is not
made up of purchase-money, as of a religion that has its price. On the monthly day,134 if
he likes, each puts in a small donation; but only if it be his pleasure, and only if he be able:
for there is no compulsion; all is voluntary. These gifts are, as it were, piety’s deposit fund.
For they are not taken thence and spent on feasts, and drinking-bouts, and eating-houses,
but to support and bury poor people, to supply the wants of boys and girls destitute of means
and parents, and of old persons confined now to the house; such, too, as have suffered
shipwreck; and if there happen to be any in the mines, or banished to the islands, or shut
up in the prisons, for nothing but their fidelity to the cause of God’s Church, they become
the nurslings of their confession. But it is mainly the deeds of a love so noble that lead many
to put a brand upon us. See, they say, how they love one135 another, for themselves are animated
by mutual hatred; how they are ready even to die for one another, for they themselves
will sooner put to death. And they are wroth with us, too, because we call each other brethren;

<pb n="90"/>
for no other reason, as I think, than because among themselves names of consanguinity are
assumed in mere pretence of affection. But we are your brethren as well, by the law of our
common mother nature, though you are hardly men, because brothers so unkind. At the
same time, how much more fittingly they are called and counted brothers who have been
led to the knowledge of God as their common Father, who have drunk in one spirit of
holiness, who from the same womb of a common ignorance have agonized into the same
light of truth! But on this very account, perhaps, we are regarded as having less claim to be
held true brothers, that no tragedy makes a noise about our brotherhood, or that the family
possessions, which generally destroy brotherhood among you, create fraternal bonds among
us. One in mind and soul, we do not hesitate to share our earthly goods with one another.
All things are common among us but our wives. We give up our community where it is
practised alone by others, who not only take possession of the wives of their friends, but
most tolerantly also accommodate their friends with theirs, following the example, I believe,
of those wise men of ancient times, the Greek Socrates and the Roman Cato, who shared
with their friends the wives whom they had married, it seems for the sake of progeny both
to themselves and to others; whether in this acting against their partners’ wishes, I am not
able to say. Why should they have any care over their chastity, when their husbands so
readily bestowed it away? O noble example of Attic wisdom, of Roman gravity—the philosopher
and the censor playing pimps! What wonder if that great love of Christians towards
one another is desecrated by you! For you abuse also our humble feasts, on the ground that
they are extravagant as well as infamously wicked. To us, it seems, applies the saying of
Diogenes: “The people of Megara feast as though they were going to die on the morrow;
they build as though they were never to die!” But one sees more readily the mote in another’s
eye than the beam in his own. Why, the very air is soured with the eructations of so many
tribes, and curiæ, and decuriæ. The Salii cannot have their feast without going into debt;
you must get the accountants to tell you what the tenths of Hercules and the sacrificial
banquets cost; the choicest cook is appointed for the Apaturia, the Dionysia, the Attic
mysteries; the smoke from the banquet of Serapis will call out the firemen. Yet about the
modest supper-room of the Christians alone a great ado is made. Our feast explains itself
by its name. The Greeks call it agapè, i.e., affection. Whatever it costs, our outlay in the
name of piety is gain, since with the good things of the feast we benefit the needy; not as it
is with you, do parasites aspire to the glory of satisfying their licentious propensities, selling
themselves for a belly-feast to all disgraceful treatment,—but as it is with God himself, a
peculiar respect is shown to the lowly. If the object of our feast be good, in the light of that
consider its further regulations. As it is an act of religious service, it permits no vileness or
immodesty. The participants, before reclining, taste first of prayer to God. As much is eaten
as satisfies the cravings of hunger; as much is drunk as befits the chaste. They say it is
enough, as those who remember that even during the night they have to worship God; they

<pb n="91"/>
talk as those who know that the Lord is one of their auditors. After manual ablution, and
the bringing in of lights, each136 is asked to stand forth and sing, as he can, a hymn to God,
either one from the holy Scriptures or one of his own composing,—a proof of the measure
of our drinking. As the feast commenced with prayer, so with prayer it is closed. We go
from it, not like troops of mischief-doers, nor bands of vagabonds, nor to break out into licentious
acts, but to have as much care of our modesty and chastity as if we had been at a
school of virtue rather than a banquet. Give the congregation of the Christians its due, and
hold it unlawful, if it is like assemblies of the illicit sort: by all means let it be condemned,
if any complaint can be validly laid against it, such as lies against secret factions. But who
has ever suffered harm from our assemblies? We are in our congregations just what we are
when separated from each other; we are as a community what we are individuals; we injure
nobody, we trouble nobody. When the upright, when the virtuous meet together, when the
pious, when the pure assemble in congregation, you ought not to call that a faction, but a
curia—[i.e., the court of God.]</p>

<p>On the contrary, they deserve the name of faction who conspire to bring odium on good
men and virtuous, who cry out against innocent blood, offering as the justification of their
enmity the baseless plea, that they think the Christians the cause of every public disaster, of
every affliction with which the people are visited. If the Tiber rises as high as the city walls,
if the Nile does not send its waters up over the fields, if the heavens give no rain, if there is
an earthquake, if there is famine or pestilence, straightway the cry137 is, “Away with the
Christians to the lion!” What! shall you give such multitudes to a single beast? Pray, tell me
how many calamities befell the world and particular cities before Tiberius reigned—before
the coming, that is, of Christ? We read of the islands of Hiera, and Anaphe, and Delos, and
Rhodes, and Cos, with many thousands of human beings, having been swallowed up. Plato
informs us that a region larger than Asia or Africa was seized by the Atlantic Ocean. An
earthquake, too, drank up the Corinthian sea; and the force of the waves cut off a part of
Lucania, whence it obtained the name of Sicily. These things surely could not have taken
place without the inhabitants suffering by them. But where—I do not say were Christians,
those despisers of your gods—but where were your gods themselves in those days, when
the flood poured its destroying waters over all the world, or, as Plato thought, merely the
level portion of it? For that they are of later date than that calamity, the very cities in which
they were born and died, nay, which they founded, bear ample testimony; for the cities could
have no existence at this day unless as belonging to postdiluvian times. Palestine had not
yet received from Egypt its Jewish swarm (of emigrants), nor had the race from which
Christians sprung yet settled down there, when its neighbors Sodom and Gomorrah were
consumed by fire from heaven. The country yet smells of that conflagration; and if there
are apples there upon the trees, it is only a promise to the eye they give—you but touch
them, and they turn to ashes. Nor had Tuscia and Campania to complain of Christians in
the days when fire from heaven overwhelmed Vulsinii, and Pompeii was destroyed by fire
from its own mountain. No one yet worshipped the true God at Rome, when Hannibal at
Cannæ counted the Roman slain by the pecks of Roman rings. Your gods were all objects
of adoration, universally acknowledged, when the Senones closely besieged the very Capitol.
And it is in keeping with all this, that if adversity has at any time befallen cities, the temples
and the walls have equally shared in the disaster, so that it is clear to demonstration the
thing was not the doing of the gods, seeing it also overtook themselves. The truth is, the
human race has always deserved ill at God’s hand. First of all, as undutiful to Him, because
when it knew Him in part, it not only did not seek after Him, but even invented other gods
of its own to worship; and further, because, as the result of their willing ignorance of the
Teacher of righteousness, the Judge and Avenger of sin, all vices and crimes grew and
<note type="footnote">137 [Christianos ad leonem. From what class, chiefly, see cap. xxxv. supra. Elucidation VIII.]</note>

<pb n="93"/>
flourished. But had men sought, they would have come to know the glorious object of their
seeking; and knowledge would have produced obedience, and obedience would have found
a gracious instead of an angry God. They ought then to see that the very same God is angry
with them now as in ancient times, before Christians were so much as spoken of. It was His
blessings they enjoyed—created before they made any of their deities: and why can they not
take it in, that their evils come from the Being whose goodness they have failed to recognize?
They suffer at the hands of Him to whom they have been ungrateful. And, for all that is said,
if we compare the calamities of former times, they fall on us more lightly now, since God
gave Christians to the world; for from that time virtue put some restraint on the world’s
wickedness, and men began to pray for the averting of God’s wrath. In a word, when the
summer clouds give no rain, and the season is matter of anxiety, you indeed—full of feasting
day by day, and ever eager for the banquet, baths and taverns and brothels always
busy—offer up to Jupiter your rain-sacrifices; you enjoin on the people barefoot processions;
you seek heaven at the Capitol; you look up to the temple-ceilings for the longed-for
clouds—God and heaven not in all your thoughts. We, dried up with fastings, and our passions
bound tightly up, holding back as long as possible from all the ordinary enjoyments
of life, rolling in sackcloth and ashes, assail heaven with our importunities—touch God’s
heart—and when we have extorted divine compassion, why, Jupiter gets all the honour!</p>

<p>You, therefore, are the sources of trouble in human affairs; on you lies the blame of
public adversities, since you are ever attracting them—you by whom God is despised and
images are worshipped. It should surely seem the more natural thing to believe that it is the
neglected One who is angry, and not they to whom all homage is paid; or most unjustly they
act, if, on account of the Christians, they send trouble on their own devotees, whom they
are bound to keep clear of the punishments of Christians. But this, you say, hits your God
as well, since He permits His worshippers to suffer on account of those who dishonour Him.
But admit first of all His providential arrangings, and you will not make this retort. For He
who once for all appointed an eternal judgment at the world’s close, does not precipitate
the separation, which is essential to judgment, before the end. Meanwhile He deals with all
sorts of men alike, so that all together share His favours and reproofs. His will is, that outcasts
and elect should have adversities and prosperities in common, that we should have all the
same experience of His goodness and severity. Having learned these things from His own
lips, we love His goodness, we fear His wrath, while both by you are treated with contempt;
and hence the sufferings of life, so far as it is our lot to be overtaken by them, are in our case
gracious admonitions, while in yours they are divine punishments. We indeed are not the
least put about: for, first, only one thing in this life greatly concerns us, and that is, to get
quickly out of it; and next, if any adversity befalls us, it is laid to the door of your transgressions.
Nay, though we are likewise involved in troubles because of our close connection
with you, we are rather glad of it, because we recognize in it divine foretellings, which, in
fact, go to confirm the confidence and faith of our hope. But if all the evils you endure are
inflicted on you by the gods you worship out of spite to us, why do you continue to pay
homage to beings so ungrateful, and unjust; who, instead of being angry with you, should
rather have been aiding and abetting you by persecuting Christians—keeping you clear of
their sufferings?</p>

<p>But we are called to account as harm-doers on another138 ground, and are accused of
being useless in the affairs of life. How in all the world can that be the case with people who
are living among you, eating the same food, wearing the same attire, having the same habits,
under the same necessities of existence? We are not Indian Brahmins or Gymnosophists,
who dwell in woods and exile themselves from ordinary human life. We do not forget the
debt of gratitude we owe to God, our Lord and Creator; we reject no creature of His hands,
though certainly we exercise restraint upon ourselves, lest of any gift of His we make an
immoderate or sinful use. So we sojourn with you in the world, abjuring neither forum, nor
shambles, nor bath, nor booth, nor workshop, nor inn, nor weekly market, nor any other
places of commerce. We sail with you, and fight with you,139 and till the ground with you;
and in like manner we unite with you in your traffickings—even in the various arts we make
public property of our works for your benefit. How it is we seem useless in your ordinary
business, living with you and by you as we do, I am not able to understand. But if I do not
frequent your religious ceremonies, I am still on the sacred day a man. I do not at the Saturnalia
bathe myself at dawn, that I may not lose both day and night; yet I bathe at a decent
and healthful hour, which preserves me both in heat and blood. I can be rigid and pallid
like you after ablution when I am dead. I do not recline in public at the feast of Bacchus,
after the manner of the beast-fighters at their final banquet. Yet of your resources I partake,
wherever I may chance to eat. I do not buy a crown for my head. What matters it to you
how I use them, if nevertheless the flowers are purchased? I think it more agreeable to have
them free and loose, waving all about. Even if they are woven into a crown, we smell the
crown with our nostrils: let those look to it who scent the perfume with their hair. We do
not go to your spectacles; yet the articles that are sold there, if I need them, I will obtain
more readily at their proper places. We certainly buy no frankincense. If the Arabias complain
of this, let the Sabæans be well assured that their more precious and costly merchandise is
expended as largely in the burying of Christians140 as in the fumigating of the gods. At any
rate, you say, the temple revenues are every day falling off:141 how few now throw in a
contribution! In truth, we are not able to give alms both to your human and your heavenly
mendicants; nor do we think that we are required to give any but to those who ask for it.
Let Jupiter then hold out his hand and get, for our compassion spends more in the streets
than yours does in the temples. But your other taxes will acknowledge a debt of gratitude

to Christians; for in the faithfulness which keeps us from fraud upon a brother, we make
conscience of paying all their dues: so that, by ascertaining how much is lost by fraud and
falsehood in the census declarations—the calculation may easily be made—it would be seen
that the ground of complaint in one department of revenue is compensated by the advantage
which others derive.</p>

<p>I will confess, however, without hesitation, that there are some who in a sense may
complain of Christians that they are a sterile race: as, for instance, pimps, and panders, and
bath-suppliers; assassins, and poisoners, and sorcerers; soothsayers, too, diviners, and astrologers.
But it is a noble fruit of Christians, that they have no fruits for such as these. And
yet, whatever loss your interests suffer from the religion we profess, the protection you have
from us makes amply up for it. What value do you set on persons, I do not here urge who
deliver you from demons, I do not urge who for your sakes present prayers before the throne
of the true God, for perhaps you have no belief in that—but from whom you can have
nothing to fear?</p>

<p>Yes, and no one considers what the loss is to the common weal,—a loss as great as it is
real, no one estimates the injury entailed upon the state, when, men of virtue as we are, we
are put to death in such numbers; when so many of the truly good suffer the last penalty.
And here we call your own acts to witness, you who are daily presiding at the trials of pris-
oners, and passing sentence upon crimes. Well, in your long lists of those accused of many
and various atrocities, has any assassin, any cutpurse, any man guilty of sacrilege, or seduction,
or stealing bathers’ clothes, his name entered as being a Christian too? Or when
Christians are brought before you on the mere ground of their name, is there ever found
among them an ill-doer of the sort? It is always with your folk the prison is steaming, the
mines are sighing, the wild beasts are fed: it is from you the exhibitors of gladiatorial shows
always get their herds of criminals to feed up for the occasion. You find no Christian there,
except simply as being such; or if one is there as something else, a Christian he is no longer.142</p>

<p>We, then, alone are without crime. Is there ought wonderful in that, if it be a very necessity
with us? For a necessity indeed it is. Taught of God himself what goodness is, we have
both a perfect knowledge of it as revealed to us by a perfect Master; and faithfully we do His
will, as enjoined on us by a Judge we dare not despise. But your ideas of virtue you have got
from mere human opinion; on human authority, too, its obligation rests: hence your system
of practical morality is deficient, both in the fulness and authority requisite to produce a
life of real virtue. Man’s wisdom to point out what is good, is no greater than his authority
to exact the keeping of it; the one is as easily deceived as the other is despised. And so, which
is the ampler rule, to say, “Thou shalt not kill,” or to teach, “Be not even angry?” Which is
more perfect, to forbid adultery, or to restrain from even a single lustful look? Which indicates
the higher intelligence, interdicting evil-doing, or evil-speaking? Which is more thorough,
not allowing an injury, or not even suffering an injury done to you to be repaid?
Though withal you know that these very laws also of yours, which seem to lead to virtue,
have been borrowed from the law of God as the ancient model. Of the age of Moses we
have already spoken. But what is the real authority of human laws, when it is in man’s power
both to evade them, by generally managing to hide himself out of sight in his crimes, and
to despise them sometimes, if inclination or necessity leads him to offend? Think of these
things, too, in the light of the brevity of any punishment you can inflict—never to last longer
than till death. On this ground Epicurus makes light of all suffering and pain, maintaining
that if it is small, it is contemptible; and if it is great, it is not long-continued. No doubt
about it, we, who receive our awards under the judgment of an all-seeing God, and who
look forward to eternal punishment from Him for sin,—we alone make real effort to attain
a blameless life, under the influence of our ampler knowledge, the impossibility of concealment,
and the greatness of the threatened torment, not merely long-enduring but everlasting,
fearing Him, whom he too should fear who the fearing judges,—even God, I mean, and not
the proconsul.</p>

<p>We have sufficiently met, as I think, the accusation of the various crimes on the ground
of which these fierce demands are made for Christian blood. We have made a full exhibition
of our case; and we have shown you how we are able to prove that our statement is correct,
from the trustworthiness, I mean, and antiquity of our sacred writings, and from the confession
likewise of the powers of spiritual wickedness themselves. Who will venture to undertake
our refutation; not with skill of words, but, as we have managed our demonstration, on the
basis of reality? But while the truth we hold is made clear to all, unbelief meanwhile, at the
very time it is convinced of the worth of Christianity, which has now become well known
for its benefits as well as from the intercourse of life, takes up the notion that it is not really
a thing divine, but rather a kind of philosophy. These are the very things, it says, the
philosophers counsel and profess—innocence, justice, patience, sobriety, chastity. Why,
then, are we not permitted an equal liberty and impunity for our doctrines as they have,
with whom, in respect of what we teach, we are compared? or why are not they, as so like
us, not pressed to the same offices, for declining which our lives are imperilled? For who
compels a philosopher to sacrifice or take an oath, or put out useless lamps at midday? Nay,
they openly overthrow your gods, and in their writings they attack your superstitions; and
you applaud them for it. Many of them even, with your countenance, bark out against your
rulers, and are rewarded with statues and salaries, instead of being given to the wild beasts.
And very right it should be so. For they are called philosophers, not Christians. This name
of philosopher has no power to put demons to the rout. Why are they not able to do that
too? since philosophers count demons inferior to gods. Socrates used to say, “If the demon
grant permission.” Yet he, too, though in denying the existence of your divinities he had a
glimpse of the truth, at his dying ordered a cock to be sacrificed to Æsculapius, I believe in
honour of his father,143 for Apollo pronounced Socrates the wisest of men. Thoughtless
Apollo! testifying to the wisdom of the man who denied the existence of his race. In proportion
to the enmity the truth awakens, you give offence by faithfully standing by it; but the
man who corrupts and makes a mere pretence of it precisely on this ground gains favour
with its persecutors. The truth which philosophers, these mockers and corrupters of it, with
hostile ends merely affect to hold, and in doing so deprave, caring for nought but glory,
Christians both intensely and intimately long for and maintain in its integrity, as those who
have a real concern about their salvation. So that we are like each other neither in our
knowledge nor our ways, as you imagine. For what certain information did Thales, the first
of natural philosophers, give in reply to the inquiry of Croesus regarding Deity, the delay
for further thought so often proving in vain? There is not a Christian workman but finds
<note type="footnote">143 [Tertullian’s exposition of this enigmatical fact (see the Phædo) is better than divers other ingenious
theories.]</note>

<pb n="101"/>
out God, and manifests Him, and hence assigns to Him all those attributes which go to
constitute a divine being, though Plato affirms that it is far from easy to discover the Maker
of the universe; and when He is found, it is difficult to make Him known to all. But if we
challenge you to comparison in the virtue of chastity, I turn to a part of the sentence passed
by the Athenians against Socrates, who was pronounced a corrupter of youth. The Christian
confines himself to the female sex. I have read also how the harlot Phryne kindled in Diogenes
the fires of lust, and how a certain Speusippus, of Plato’s school, perished in the adulterous
act. The Christian husband has nothing to do with any but his own wife. Democritus, in
putting out his eyes, because he could not look on women without lusting after them, and
was pained if his passion was not satisfied, owns plainly, by the punishment he inflicts, his
incontinence. But a Christian with grace-healed eyes is sightless in this matter; he is mentally
blind against the assaults of passion. If I maintain our superior modesty of behaviour, there
at once occurs to me Diogenes with filth-covered feet trampling on the proud couches of
Plato, under the influence of another pride: the Christian does not even play the proud man
to the pauper. If sobriety of spirit be the virtue in debate, why, there are Pythagoras at
Thurii, and Zeno at Priene, ambitious of the supreme power: the Christian does not aspire
to the ædileship. If equanimity be the contention, you have Lycurgus choosing death by
self-starvation, because the Lacons had made some emendation of his laws: the Christian,
even when he is condemned, gives thanks.144 If the comparison be made in regard to
trustworthiness, Anaxagoras denied the deposit of his enemies: the Christian is noted for
his fidelity even among those who are not of his religion. If the matter of sincerity is to be
brought to trial, Aristotle basely thrust his friend Hermias from his place: the Christian
does no harm even to his foe. With equal baseness does Aristotle play the sycophant to Alexander,
instead of exercising to keep him in the right way, and Plato allows himself to be
bought by Dionysius for his belly’s sake. Aristippus in the purple, with all his great show of
gravity, gives way to extravagance; and Hippias is put to death laying plots against the state:
no Christian ever attempted such a thing in behalf of his brethren, even when persecution
was scattering them abroad with every atrocity. But it will be said that some of us, too, depart
from the rules of our discipline. In that case, however, we count them no longer Christians;
but the philosophers who do such things retain still the name and the honour of wisdom.
So, then, where is there any likeness between the Christian and the philosopher? between
the disciple of Greece and of heaven? between the man whose object is fame, and whose
object is life? between the talker and the doer? between the man who builds up and the man
who pulls down? between the friend and the foe of error? between one who corrupts the
truth, and one who restores and teaches it? between its chief and its custodier?</p>

<p>Unless I am utterly mistaken, there is nothing so old as the truth; and the already proved
antiquity of the divine writings is so far of use to me, that it leads men more easily to take
it in that they are the treasure-source whence all later wisdom has been taken. And were it
not necessary to keep my work to a moderate size, I might launch forth also into the proof
of this. What poet or sophist has not drunk at the fountain of the prophets? Thence, accord-
ingly, the philosophers watered their arid minds, so that it is the things they have from us
which bring us into comparison with them. For this reason, I imagine, philosophy was
banished by certain states—I mean by the Thebans, by the Spartans also, and the Argives—its
disciples sought to imitate our doctrines; and ambitious, as I have said, of glory and eloquence
alone, if they fell upon anything in the collection of sacred Scriptures which displeased them,
in their own peculiar style of research, they perverted it to serve their purpose: for they had
no adequate faith in their divinity to keep them from changing them, nor had they any
sufficient understanding of them, either, as being still at the time under veil—even obscure
to the Jews themselves, whose peculiar possession they seemed to be. For so, too, if the truth
was distinguished by its simplicity, the more on that account the fastidiousness of man, too
proud to believe, set to altering it; so that even what they found certain they made uncertain
by their admixtures. Finding a simple revelation of God, they proceeded to dispute about
Him, not as He had revealed to them, but turned aside to debate about His properties, His
nature, His abode. Some assert Him to be incorporeal; others maintain He has a body,—the
Platonists teaching the one doctrine, and the Stoics the other. Some think that He is composed
of atoms, others of numbers: such are the different views of Epicurus and Pythagoras.
One thinks He is made of fire; so it appeared to Heraclitus. The Platonists, again, hold that
He administers the affairs of the world; the Epicureans, on the contrary, that He is idle and
inactive, and, so to speak, a nobody in human things. Then the Stoics represent Him as
placed outside the world, and whirling round this huge mass from without like a potter;
while the Platonists place Him within the world, as a pilot is in the ship he steers. So, in like
manner, they differ in their views about the world itself, whether it is created or uncreated,
whether it is destined to pass away or to remain for ever. So again it is debated concerning
the nature of the soul, which some contend is divine and eternal, while others hold that it
is dissoluble. According to each one’s fancy, He has introduced either something new, or
refashioned the old. Nor need we wonder if the speculations of philosophers have perverted
the older Scriptures. Some of their brood, with their opinions, have even adulterated our
new-given Christian revelation, and corrupted it into a system of philosophic doctrines,
and from the one path have struck off many and inexplicable by-roads.145 And I have alluded
to this, lest any one becoming acquainted with the variety of parties among us, this might

<pb n="103"/>
seem to him to put us on a level with the philosophers, and he might condemn the truth
from the different ways in which it is defended. But we at once put in a plea in bar against
these tainters of our purity, asserting that this is the rule of truth which comes down from
Christ by transmission through His companions, to whom we shall prove that those devisers
of different doctrines are all posterior. Everything opposed to the truth has been got up from
the truth itself, the spirits of error carrying on this system of opposition. By them all corruptions
of wholesome discipline have been secretly instigated; by them, too, certain fables have
been introduced, that, by their resemblance to the truth, they might impair its credibility,
or vindicate their own higher claims to faith; so that people might think Christians unworthy
of credit because the poets or philosophers are so, or might regard the poets and philosophers
as worthier of confidence from their not being followers of Christ. Accordingly, we get
ourselves laughed at for proclaiming that God will one day judge the world. For, like us, the
poets and philosophers set up a judgment-seat in the realms below. And if we threaten
Gehenna, which is a reservoir of secret fire under the earth for purposes of punishment, we
have in the same way derision heaped on us. For so, too, they have their Pyriphlegethon, a
river of flame in the regions of the dead. And if we speak of Paradise,146 the place of heavenly
bliss appointed to receive the spirits of the saints, severed from the knowledge of this world
by that fiery zone as by a sort of enclosure, the Elysian plains have taken possession of their
faith. Whence is it, I pray you have all this, so like us, in the poets and philosophers? The
reason simply is, that they have been taken from our religion. But if they are taken from our
sacred things, as being of earlier date, then ours are the truer, and have higher claims upon
belief, since even their imitations find faith among you. If they maintain their sacred mysteries
to have sprung from their own minds, in that case ours will be reflections of what are
later than themselves, which by the nature of things is impossible, for never does the shadow
precede the body which casts it, or the image the reality.147</p>

<p>Come now, if some philosopher affirms, as Laberius holds, following an opinion of
Pythagoras, that a man may have his origin from a mule, a serpent from a woman, and with
skill of speech twists every argument to prove his view, will he not gain acceptance for and
work in some the conviction that, on account of this, they should even abstain from eating
animal food? May any one have the persuasion that he should so abstain, lest by chance in
his beef he eats of some ancestor of his? But if a Christian promises the return of a man
from a man, and the very actual Gaius from Gaius,148 the cry of the people will be to have
him stoned; they will not even so much as grant him a hearing. If there is any ground for
the moving to and fro of human souls into different bodies, why may they not return into
the very substance they have left, seeing this is to be restored, to be that which had been?
They are no longer the very things they had been; for they could not be what they were not,
without first ceasing to be what they had been. If we were inclined to give all rein upon this
point, discussing into what various beasts one and another might probably be changed, we
would need at our leisure to take up many points. But this we would do chiefly in our own
defence, as setting forth what is greatly worthier of belief, that a man will come back from
a man—any given person from any given person, still retaining his humanity; so that the
soul, with its qualities unchanged, may be restored to the same condition, thought not to
the same outward framework. Assuredly, as the reason why restoration takes place at all is
the appointed judgment, every man must needs come forth the very same who had once
existed, that he may receive at God’s hands a judgment, whether of good desert or the opposite.
And therefore the body too will appear; for the soul is not capable of suffering without
the solid substance (that is, the flesh; and for this reason, also) that it is not right that souls
should have all the wrath of God to bear: they did not sin without the body, within which
all was done by them. But how, you say, can a substance which has been dissolved be made
to reappear again? Consider thyself, O man, and thou wilt believe in it! Reflect on what you
were before you came into existence. Nothing. For if you had been anything, you would
have remembered it. You, then, who were nothing before you existed, reduced to nothing
also when you cease to be, why may you not come into being again out of nothing, at the
will of the same Creator whose will created you out of nothing at the first? Will it be anything
new in your case? You who were not, were made; when you cease to be again, you shall be
made. Explain, if you can, your original creation, and then demand to know how you shall
be re-created. Indeed, it will be still easier surely to make you what you were once, when
the very same creative power made you without difficulty what you never were before. There
will be doubts, perhaps, as to the power of God, of Him who hung in its place this huge
body of our world, made out of what had never existed, as from a death of emptiness and
<note type="footnote">148 [i.e., Caius, used (like John Doe with us) in Roman Law.]</note>

<pb n="105"/>
inanity, animated by the Spirit who quickens all living things, its very self the unmistakable
type of the resurrection, that it might be to you a witness—nay, the exact image of the resurrection.
Light, every day extinguished, shines out again; and, with like alternation, darkness
succeeds light’s outgoing. The defunct stars re-live; the seasons, as soon as they are finished,
renew their course; the fruits are brought to maturity, and then are reproduced. The seeds
do not spring up with abundant produce, save as they rot and dissolve away;—all things are
preserved by perishing, all things are refashioned out of death. Thou, man of nature so exalted,
if thou understandest thyself, taught even by the Pythian149 words, lord of all these
things that die and rise,—shalt thou die to perish evermore? Wherever your dissolution
shall have taken place, whatever material agent has destroyed you, or swallowed you up, or
swept you away, or reduced you to nothingness, it shall again restore you. Even nothingness
is His who is Lord of all. You ask, Shall we then be always dying, and rising up from death?
If so the Lord of all things had appointed, you would have to submit, though unwillingly,
to the law of your creation. But, in fact, He has no other purpose than that of which He has
informed us. The Reason which made the universe out of diverse elements, so that all things
might be composed of opposite substances in unity—of void and solid, of animate and inanimate,
of comprehensible and incomprehensible, of light and darkness, of life itself and
death—has also disposed time into order, by fixing and distinguishing its mode, according
to which this first portion of it, which we inhabit from the beginning of the world, flows
down by a temporal course to a close; but the portion which succeeds, and to which we look
forward continues forever. When, therefore, the boundary and limit, that millennial interspace,
has been passed, when even the outward fashion of the world itself—which has been
spread like a veil over the eternal economy, equally a thing of time—passes away, then the
whole human race shall be raised again, to have its dues meted out according as it has merited
in the period of good or evil, and thereafter to have these paid out through the immeasurable
ages of eternity. Therefore after this there is neither death nor repeated resurrections, but
we shall be the same that we are now, and still unchanged—the servants of God, ever with
God, clothed upon with the proper substance of eternity; but the profane, and all who are
not true worshippers of God, in like manner shall be consigned to the punishment of everlasting
fire—that fire which, from its very nature indeed, directly ministers to their incorruptibility.
The philosophers are familiar as well as we with the distinction between a common
and a secret fire. Thus that which is in common use is far different from that which we see
in divine judgments, whether striking as thunderbolts from heaven, or bursting up out of
the earth through mountain-tops; for it does not consume what it scorches, but while it
burns it repairs. So the mountains continue ever burning; and a person struck by lighting

<p>These are what are called presumptuous speculations in our case alone; in the philosophers
and poets they are regarded as sublime speculations and illustrious discoveries. They
are men of wisdom, we are fools. They are worthy of all honour, we are folk to have the
finger pointed at; nay, besides that, we are even to have punishments inflicted on us. But let
things which are the defence of virtue, if you will, have no foundation, and give them duly
the name of fancies, yet still they are necessary; let them be absurd if you will, yet they are
of use: they make all who believe them better men and women, under the fear of neverending
punishment and the hope of never-ending bliss. It is not, then, wise to brand as
false, nor to regard as absurd, things the truth of which it is expedient to presume. On no
ground is it right positively to condemn as bad what beyond all doubt is profitable. Thus,
in fact, you are guilty of the very presumption of which you accuse us, in condemning what
is useful. It is equally out of the question to regard them as nonsensical; at any rate, if they
are false and foolish, they hurt nobody. For they are just (in that case) like many other things
on which you inflict no penalties—foolish and fabulous things, I mean, which, as quite innocuous,
are never charged as crimes or punished. But in a thing of the kind, if this be so
indeed, we should be adjudged to ridicule, not to swords, and flames, and crosses, and wild
beasts, in which iniquitous cruelty not only the blinded populace exults and insults over us,
but in which some of you too glory, not scrupling to gain the popular favour by your injustice.
As though all you can do to us did not depend upon our pleasure. It is assuredly a matter
of my own inclination, being a Christian. Your condemnation, then, will only reach me in
that case, if I wish to be condemned; but when all you can do to me, you can do only at my
will, all you can do is dependent on my will, and is not in your power. The joy of the people
in our trouble is therefore utterly reasonless. For it is our joy they appropriate to themselves,
since we would far rather be condemned than apostatize from God; on the contrary, our
haters should be sorry rather than rejoice, as we have obtained the very thing of our own
choice.</p>

<p>In that case, you say, why do you complain of our persecutions? You ought rather to
be grateful to us for giving you the sufferings you want. Well, it is quite true that it is our
desire to suffer, but it is in the way that the soldier longs for war. No one indeed suffers
willingly, since suffering necessarily implies fear and danger. Yet the man who objected to
the conflict, both fights with all his strength, and when victorious, he rejoices in the battle,
because he reaps from it glory and spoil. It is our battle to be summoned to your tribunals
that there, under fear of execution, we may battle for the truth. But the day is won when the
object of the struggle is gained. This victory of ours gives us the glory of pleasing God, and
the spoil of life eternal. But we are overcome. Yes, when we have obtained our wishes.
Therefore we conquer in dying;151 we go forth victorious at the very time we are subdued.
Call us, if you like, Sarmenticii and Semaxii, because, bound to a half-axle stake, we are
burned in a circle-heap of fagots. This is the attitude in which we conquer, it is our victoryrobe,
it is for us a sort of triumphal car. Naturally enough, therefore, we do not please the
vanquished; on account of this, indeed, we are counted a desperate, reckless race. But the
very desperation and recklessness you object to in us, among yourselves lift high the standard
of virtue in the cause of glory and of fame. Mucius of his own will left his right hand on the
altar: what sublimity of mind! Empedocles gave his whole body at Catana to the fires of
Ætna: what mental resolution! A certain foundress of Carthage gave herself away in second
marriage to the funeral pile: what a noble witness of her chastity! Regulus, not wishing that
his one life should count for the lives of many enemies, endured these crosses over all his
frame: how brave a man—even in captivity a conqueror! Anaxarchus, when he was being
beaten to death by a barley-pounder, cried out, “Beat on, beat on at the case of Anaxarchus;
no stroke falls on Anaxarchus himself.” O magnanimity of the philosopher, who even in
such an end had jokes upon his lips! I omit all reference to those who with their own sword,
or with any other milder form of death, have bargained for glory. Nay, see how even torture
contests are crowned by you. The Athenian courtezan, having wearied out the executioner,
at last bit off her tongue and spat it in the face of the raging tyrant, that she might at the
same time spit away her power of speech, nor be longer able to confess her fellow-conspirators,
if even overcome, that might be her inclination. Zeno the Eleatic, when he was asked
by Dionysius what good philosophy did, on answering that it gave contempt of death, was
all unquailing, given over to the tyrant’s scourge, and sealed his opinion even to the death.
We all know how the Spartan lash, applied with the utmost cruelty under the very eyes of
friends encouraging, confers on those who bear it honor proportionate to the blood which
the young men shed. O glory legitimate, because it is human, for whose sake it is counted
neither reckless foolhardiness, nor desperate obstinacy, to despise death itself and all sorts
<note type="footnote">151 [Vicimus cum occidimur.]</note>

<pb n="109"/>
of savage treatment; for whose sake you may for your native place, for the empire, for
friendship, endure all you are forbidden to do for God! And you cast statues in honour of
persons such as these, and you put inscriptions upon images, and cut out epitaphs on tombs,
that their names may never perish. In so far you can by your monuments, you yourselves
afford a sort of resurrection to the dead. Yet he who expects the true resurrection from God,
is insane, if for God he suffers! But go zealously on, good presidents, you will stand higher
with the people if you sacrifice the Christians at their wish, kill us, torture us, condemn us,
grind us to dust; your injustice is the proof that we are innocent. Therefore God suffers that
we thus suffer; for but very lately, in condemning a Christian woman to the leno rather than
to the leo you made confession that a taint on our purity is considered among us something
more terrible than any punishment and any death.152 Nor does your cruelty, however exquisite,
avail you; it is rather a temptation to us. The oftener we are mown down by you,
the more in number we grow; the blood of Christians is seed.153 Many of your writers exhort
to the courageous bearing of pain and death, as Cicero in the Tusculans, as Seneca in his
Chances, as Diogenes, Pyrrhus, Callinicus; and yet their words do not find so many disciples
as Christians do, teachers not by words, but by their deeds. That very obstinacy you rail
against is the preceptress. For who that contemplates it, is not excited to inquire what is at
the bottom of it? who, after inquiry, does not embrace our doctrines? and when he has embraced
them, desires not to suffer that he may become partaker of the fulness of God’s grace,
that he may obtain from God complete forgiveness, by giving in exchange his blood? For
that secures the remission of all offences. On this account it is that we return thanks on the
very spot for your sentences. As the divine and human are ever opposed to each other, when
we are condemned by you, we are acquitted by the Highest.</p>

<p>I.
(Arrangement, p. 4, supra.)</p>
<p>The arrangement I have adopted in editing these Edinburgh Translations of Tertullian
is a practical one. It will be found logical and helpful to the student, who is referred to the
Prefatory pages of this volume for an Elucidation of the difficulties, with which any arrangement
of these treatises is encumbered. For, first, an attempt to place them in chronological
order is out of the question;154 and, second, all efforts to separate precisely the Orthodox
from the Montanistic or Montanist works of our author have hitherto defied the acumen
of critics. It would be mere empiricism for me to attempt an original classification in the
face of questions which even experts have been unable to determine.</p>
<p>If we bear in mind, however, a few guiding facts, we shall see that difficulties are less
than might appear, assuming our object to be a practical one. (1.) Only four of these essays
were written against Orthodoxy; (2.) five more are reckoned as wholly uncertain, which
amounts to saying that they are not positively heretical. (3.) Again, five are colourless, as to
Montanism, and hence should be reputed Orthodox. (4.) Of others, written after the influences
of Montanism had, more or less, tainted his doctrine, the whole are yet valuable and
some are noble defences of the Catholic Faith. (5.) Finally eight or ten of his treatises were
written while he was a Catholic, and are precious contributions to the testimony of the
Primitive Church.</p>
<p>From these facts, we may readily conclude that the mass of Tertullian’s writings is Orthodox.
Some of them are to be read with caution; others, again, must be rejected for their
heresy; but yet all are most instructive historically, and as defining even by errors “the faith
once delivered to the Saints.” I propose to note those which require caution as we pass them
in review. Those written against the Church are classed by themselves, at the end of the list,
and all the rest may be read with confidence. A most interesting inquiry arises in connection
with the quotations from Scripture to be found in our author. Did a Latin version exist in
his day, or does he translate from the Greek of the New Testament and the LXX? A paradoxical
writer (Semler) contends that Tertullian “never used a Greek ms.” (see Kaye, p. 106.)
But Tertullian’s rugged Latin betrays everywhere his familiarity with Greek idioms and
forms of thought. He wrote, also, in Greek, and there is no reason to doubt that he knew
the Greek Scriptures primarily, if he knew any Greek whatever. Possibly we owe to Tertullian

<pb n="111"/>
the primordia of the Old African Latin Versions, some of which seem to have contained the
disputed text 1 John v. 7; of which more when we come to the Praxeas. For the present in
the absence of definite evidence we must infer that Tertullian usually translated from the
LXX, and from the originals of the New Testament. But Mosheim thinks the progress of
the Gospel in the West was now facilitated by the existence of Latin Versions. Observe,
also, Kaye’s important note, p. 293, and his reference to Lardner, Cred. xxvii. 19.</p>

<p>II.
(Address to Magistrates, cap. i., p. 17.)</p>
<p>The Apology comes first in order, on logical grounds. It is classed with our author’s
orthodox works by Neander, and pronounced colourless by Kaye. It is the noblest of his
productions in its purpose and spirit, and it falls in with the Primitive System of Apologetics.
I have placed next in order to it several treatises, mostly unblemished, which are of the same
character; which defend the cause of Christians against Paganism, against Gentile Philosophy,
and against Judaism; closing this portion by the two books Ad Nationes, which may be regarded
as a recapitulation of the author’s arguments, especially those to be found in the
Apology. In these successive works, as compared with those of Justin Martyr, we obtain a
fair view of the progressive relations of the Church with the Roman Empire and with divers
antagonistic systems in the East and West.</p>

<p>The following Chronological outline borrowed from the Benedictines and from Bishop
Kaye, will prove serviceable here.155</p>
<p>Tertullian born (circa) a.d. 150.</p>
<p>Tertullian converted (surmise) 185.</p>
<p>Tertullian married (say) 186.</p>
<p>Tertullian ordained presbyter (circa) 192.</p>
<p>Tertullian lapsed (circa) 200.</p>
<p>Tertullian deceased (extreme surmise) 240.</p>
<p>The Imperial history of his period may be thus arranged:</p>
<p>Birth of Caracalla a.d. 188.</p>
<p>Birth of Geta 189.</p>

<p>Death of Severus 211.</p>

<p>IV.
(Tiberius, capp. v. and xxiv., pp. 22 and 35.)</p>
<p>A fair examination of what has been said on this subject, pro and con, may be found in
Kaye’s Tertullian,156 pp. 102–105. In his abundant candour this author leans to the doubters,
but in stating the case he seems to me to fortify the position of Lardner and Mosheim. What
the brutal Tiberius may have thought or done with respect to Pilate’s report concerning the
holy victim of his judicial injustice is of little importance to the believer. Nevertheless, as
matter of history it deserves attention. Great stress is to be placed on the fact that Tertullian
was probably a jurisconsult, familiar with the Roman archives, and influenced by them in
his own acceptance of Divine Truth. It is not supposable that such a man would have hazarded
his bold appeal to the records, in remonstrating with the Senate and in the very faces
of the Emperor and his colleagues, had he not known that the evidence was irrefragable.</p>

<p>V.
(The darkness at the Crucifixion, cap. xxi., p. 35.)</p>
<p>Kaye disappoints us (p. 150) in his slight notice of this most interesting subject. Without
attempting to discuss the story of Phlegon and other points which afford Gibbon an oppor-
<note type="footnote">156 My references are to the Third Edition, London, Rivingtons, 1845.</note>

<pb n="113"/>
tunity for misplaced sneering, such as even a Pilate would have rebuked, while it may be
well to recall the exposition of Milman,157 at the close of Gibbon’s fifteenth chapter, I must
express my own preference for another view. This will be found candidly summed up and
stated, in the Speaker’s Commentary, in the concise note on St. Matt. xxvii. 45.</p>

<p>VI.
(Numbers of the Faithful, cap. xxxvii., p. 45.)</p>
<p>Kaye, as usual, gives this vexed question a candid survey.158 Making all allowances,
however, I accept the conjecture of some reputable authorities, that there were 2,000,000 of
Christians, in the bounds of the Roman Empire at the close of the Second Century. So
mightily grew the testimony of Jesus and prevailed. When we reflect that only a century
intervened between the times of Tertullian and the conversion of the Roman Emperor, it is
not easy to regard our author’s language as merely that of fervid genius and of rhetorical
hyperbole. He could not have ventured upon exaggeration without courting scorn as well
as defeat. What he affirms is probable in the nature of the case. Were it otherwise, then the
conditions, which, in a single century rendered it possible for Constantine to effect the
greatest revolution in mind and manners that has ever been known among men, would be
a miracle compared with which that of his alleged Vision of the Cross sinks into insignificance.
To this subject it will be necessary to recur hereafter.</p>

<p>VII.
(Christian usages, cap. xxxix., p. 46.)</p>
<p>A candid review of the matters discussed in this chapter will be found in Kaye (pp. 146,
209.) The important fact is there clearly stated that “the primitive Christians scrupulously
complied with the decree pronounced by the Apostles at Jerusalem in abstaining from things
strangled and from blood” (Acts xv. 20). On this subject consult the references given in the
Speaker’s Commentary, ad locum. The Greeks, to their honour, still maintain this prohibition,
but St. Augustine’s great authority relaxed the Western scruples on this matter, for he regarded
it as a decree of temporary obligation, while the Hebrew and Gentile Christians were
in peril of misunderstanding and estrangement.159</p>
<p>On the important question as to the cessation of miracles Kaye takes a somewhat original
position. But see his interesting discussion and that of the late Professor Hey, in Kaye’s
<note type="footnote">157 In his edition of The Decline and Fall, Vol. I., p. 589, American reprint.</note>

<pb n="114"/>
Tertullian, pp. 80–102, 151–161. I do not think writers on these subjects have sufficiently
distinguished between miracles properly so called, and providences vouchsafed in answer
to prayer. There was no miracle in the case of the Thundering Legion, assuming the story
to be true; and I dare to affirm that marked answers to prayer, by providential interpositions,
but wholly distinct from miraculous agencies, have never ceased among those who “ask in
the Son’s Name.” Such interpositions are often preternatural only; that is, they economize
certain powers which, though natural in themselves, lie outside of the System of Nature
with which we happen to be familiar. This distinction has been overlooked.</p>

<p>VIII.
(Multitudes, cap. xl., p. 47.)</p>
<p>Note the words—“multitudes to a single beast.” Can it be possible that Tertullian would
use such language to the magistrates, if he knew that such sentences were of rare occurrence?
The disposition of our times to minimize the persecutions of our Christian forefathers calls
upon us to note such references, all the more important because occurring obiter and
mentioned as notorious. Note also, the closing chapter of this Apology, and reference to the
outcries of the populace, in Cap. xxxv.160 See admirable remarks on the benefits derived by
the Church from the sufferings of Christian martyrs, with direct reference to Tertullian,
Wordsworth, Church Hist. to Council of Nicæa, cap. xxiv., p. 374.</p>

<p>IX.
(Christian manners, cap. xlii., p. 49.)</p>
<p>A study of the manners of Christians, in the Ante-Nicene Age, as sketched by the unsparing
hand of Tertullian, will convince any unprejudiced mind of the mighty power of
the Holy Ghost, in framing such characters out of heathen originals. When, under
Montanistic influences our severely ascetic author complains of the Church’s corruptions,
and turns inside-out the whole estate of the faithful, we see all that can be pressed on the
other side; but, this very important chapter must be borne in mind, together with the closing
sentence of chap. xliv., as evidence that whatever might be said by a rigid disciplinarian, the
Church, as compared with our day, was still a living embodiment of Philippians iv. 8.</p>

<p>X.
(Paradise, cap. xlvii., p. 52.)</p>
<note type="footnote">160 Compare Kaye on Mosheim, p. 107.</note>

<pb n="115"/>
<p>See Kaye, p. 248. Our author seems not always consistent with himself in his references
to the Places of departed spirits. Kaye thinks he identifies Paradise with the Heaven of the
Most High, in one place (the De Exhort. Cast., xiii.) where he probably confuses the Apostle’s
ideas, in Galatians v. 12, and Ephesians v. 5. Commonly, however, though he is not consistent
with himself, this would be his scheme:—</p>
<p>1. The Inferi, or Hades, where the soul of Dives was in one continent and that of Lazarus
in another, with a gulf between. Our author places “Abraham’s bosom” in Hades.</p>
<p>2. Paradise. In Hades, but in a superior and more glorious region. This more blessed
abode was opened to the souls of the martyrs and other greater saints, at our Lord’s
descent into the place of the dead. After the General Resurrection and Judgment,
there remain:</p>
<p>1. Gehenna, for the lost, prepared for the devil and his angels.</p>
<p>2. The Heaven of Heavens, the eternal abode of the righteous, in the vision of the Lord
and His Eternal Joy.</p>
<p>Tertullian’s variations on this subject will force us to recur to it hereafter; but, here it
may be noted that the confusions of Latin Christianity received their character in this par-
ticular, from the genius of our author. Augustine caught from him a certain indecision about
the terms and places connected with the state of the departed which has continued, to this
day, to perplex theologians in the West. Taking advantage of such confusions, the stupendous
Roman system of “Purgatory” was fabricated in the middle ages; but the Greeks never accepted
it, and it differs fundamentally from what the earlier Latin Fathers, including Tertullian,
have given us as speculations.</p>

<p>XI.
(The Leo and the Leno, cap. l., p. 55.)</p>
<p>Here we find the alliterative and epigrammatic genius of Tertullian anticipating a similar
poetic charm in Augustine. The Christian maid or matron preferred the Leo to the leno;
to be devoured rather than to be debauched. Our author wrests a tribute to the chastity of
Christian women from the cruelty of their judges, who recognizing this fact, were accustomed
as a refinement of their injustice to give sentence against them, refusing the mercy of a
horrible death, by committing them to the ravisher: “damnando Christianam ad lenonem
potius quam ad leonem.”</p>

<p>XII.
(The Seed of the Church, cap. l., p. 55.)</p>

<pb n="116"/>
<p>Kaye has devoted a number of his pages161 to the elucidation of this subject, not only
showing the constancy of the martyrs, but illustrating the fact that Christians, like St. Paul,
were forced to “die daily,” even when they were not subjected to the fiery trial. He who
confessed himself a Christian made himself a social outcast. All manner of outrages and
wrongs could be committed against him with impunity. Rich men, who had joined themselves
to Christ,162 were forced to accept “the spoiling of their goods.” Brothers denounced
brothers, and husbands their wives; “a man’s foes were they of his own household.” But the
Church triumphed through suffering, and “out of weakness was made strong.”</p>

<p>[Translated by the Rev. S. Thelwall.]</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>Chapter I.—Wide Scope of the Word Idolatry.</head>
<p>The principal crime of the human race, the highest guilt charged upon the world, the
whole procuring cause of judgment, is idolatry.163 For, although each single fault retains
its own proper feature, although it is destined to judgment under its own proper name also,
yet it is marked off under the general account of idolatry. Set aside names, examine works,
the idolater is likewise a murderer. Do you inquire whom he has slain? If it contributes
ought to the aggravation of the indictment, no stranger nor personal enemy, but his own
self. By what snares? Those of his error. By what weapon? The offence done to God. By how
many blows? As many as are his idolatries. He who affirms that the idolater perishes not,164
will affirm that the idolater has not committed murder. Further, you may recognize in the
same crime165 adultery and fornication; for he who serves false gods is doubtless an
adulterer166 of truth, because all falsehood is adultery. So, too, he is sunk in fornication.
For who that is a fellow-worker with unclean spirits, does not stalk in general pollution and
fornication? And thus it is that the Holy Scriptures167 use the designation of fornication in
their upbraiding of idolatry. The essence of fraud, I take it, is, that any should seize what is

volume. After this and the Apology come three treatises confirming its positions, and vindicating the principles
of Christians in conflict with Idolatry, the great generic crime of a world lying in wickedness. These three are
the De Spectaculis, the De Corona and the Ad Scapulam. The De Spectaculis was written after this treatise, in
which indeed it is mentioned (Cap. xiii.), but logically it follows, illustrates and enforces it. Hence my practical
plan: which will be concluded by a scheme (conjectural in part) of chronological order in which precision is affirmed
by all critics to be impossible, but, by which we may reach approximate accuracy, with great advantage.

another’s, or refuse to another his due; and, of course, fraud done toward man is a name of
greatest crime. Well, but idolatry does fraud to God, by refusing to Him, and conferring on
others, His honours; so that to fraud it also conjoins contumely. But if fraud, just as much
as fornication and adultery, entails death, then, in these cases, equally with the former, idolatry
stands unacquitted of the impeachment of murder. After such crimes, so pernicious,
so devouring of salvation, all other crimes also, after some manner, and separately disposed
in order, find their own essence represented in idolatry. In it also are the concupiscences of
the world. For what solemnity of idolatry is without the circumstance of dress and ornament?
In it are lasciviousnesses and drunkennesses; since it is, for the most part, for the sake of food,
and stomach, and appetite, that these solemnities are frequented. In it is unrighteousness.
For what more unrighteous than it, which knows not the Father of righteousness? In it also
is vanity, since its whole system is vain. In it is mendacity, for its whole substance is false.
Thus it comes to pass, that in idolatry all crimes are detected, and in all crimes idolatry.
Even otherwise, since all faults savour of opposition to God, and there is nothing which savours
of opposition to God which is not assigned to demons and unclean spirits, whose
property idols are; doubtless, whoever commits a fault is chargeable with idolatry, for he
does that which pertains to the proprietors of idols.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—Idolatry in Its More Limited Sense. Its Copiousness.</head>
<p>But let the universal names of crimes withdraw to the specialities of their own works;
let idolatry remain in that which it is itself. Sufficient to itself is a name so inimical to God,
a substance of crime so copious, which reaches forth so many branches, diffuses so many
veins, that from this name, for the greatest part, is drawn the material of all the modes in
which the expansiveness of idolatry has to be foreguarded against by us, since in manifold
wise it subverts the servants of God; and this not only when unperceived, but also when
cloaked over. Most men simply regard idolatry as to be interpreted in these senses alone,
viz.: if one burn incense, or immolate a victim, or give a sacrificial banquet, or be bound to
some sacred functions or priesthoods; just as if one were to regard adultery as to be accounted
in kisses, and in embraces, and in actual fleshly contact; or murder as to be reckoned only
in the shedding forth of blood, and in the actual taking away of life. But how far wider an
extent the Lord assigns to those crimes we are sure: when He defines adultery to consist even
in concupiscence,168 “if one shall have cast an eye lustfully on,” and stirred his soul with
immodest commotion; when He judges murder169 to consist even in a word of curse or of
reproach, and in every impulse of anger, and in the neglect of charity toward a brother just
as John teaches,170 that he who hates his brother is a murderer. Else, both the devil’s ingenuity
in malice, and God the Lord’s in the Discipline by which He fortifies us against the devil’s
depths,171 would have but limited scope, if we were judged only in such faults as even the
heathen nations have decreed punishable. How will our “righteousness abound above that
of the Scribes and Pharisees,” as the Lord has prescribed,172 unless we shall have seen through
the abundance of that adversary quality, that is, of unrighteousness? But if the head of unrighteousness
is idolatry, the first point is, that we be fore-fortified against the abundance
of idolatry, while we recognise it not only in its palpable manifestations.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Idolatry: Origin and Meaning of the Name.</head>
<p>Idol in ancient times there was none. Before the artificers of this monstrosity had bubbled
into being,173 temples stood solitary and shrines empty, just as to the present day in some
places traces of the ancient practice remain permanently. Yet idolatry used to be practised,
not under that name, but in that function; for even at this day it can be practised outside a
temple, and without an idol. But when the devil introduced into the world artificers of
statues and of images, and of every kind of likenesses, that former rude business of human
disaster attained from idols both a name and a development. Thenceforward every art which
in any way produces an idol instantly became a fount of idolatry. For it makes no difference
whether a moulder cast, or a carver grave, or an embroiderer weave the idol; because neither
is it a question of material, whether an idol be formed of gypsum, or of colors, or of stone,
or of bronze,174 or of silver, or of thread. For since even without an idol idolatry is committed,
when the idol is there it makes no difference of what kind it be, of what material, or what
shape; lest any should think that only to be held an idol which is consecrated in human
shape. To establish this point, the interpretation of the word is requisite. Eidos, in Greek,
signifies form; eidolon, derived diminutively from that, by an equivalent process in our language,
makes formling.175 Every form or formling, therefore, claims to be called an idol.
Hence idolatry is “all attendance and service about every idol.” Hence also, every artificer
of an idol is guilty of one and the same crime,176 unless, the People177 which consecrated
for itself the likeness of a calf, and not of a man, fell short of incurring the guilt of idolatry.178</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Idols Not to Be Made, Much Less Worshipped. Idols and Idol-Makers
in the Same Category.</head>
<p>God prohibits an idol as much to be made as to be worshipped. In so far as the making
what may be worshipped is the prior act, so far is the prohibition to make (if the worship is
unlawful) the prior prohibition. For this cause—the eradicating, namely, of the material of
idolatry—the divine law proclaims, “Thou shalt make no idol;”179 and by conjoining, “Nor
a similitude of the things which are in the heaven, and which are in the earth, and which
are in the sea,” has interdicted the servants of God from acts of that kind all the universe
over. Enoch had preceded, predicting that “the demons, and the spirits of the angelic
apostates,180 would turn into idolatry all the elements, all the garniture of the universe, all
things contained in the heaven, in the sea, in the earth, that they might be consecrated as
God, in opposition to God.” All things, therefore, does human error worship, except the
Founder of all Himself. The images of those things are idols; the consecration of the images
is idolatry. Whatever guilt idolatry incurs, must necessarily be imputed to every artificer of
every idol. In short, the same Enoch fore-condemns in general menace both idol-worshippers
and idol-makers together. And again: “I swear to you, sinners, that against the day of perdition
of blood181 repentance is being prepared. Ye who serve stones, and ye who make
images of gold, and silver, and wood, and stones and clay, and serve phantoms, and demons,
and spirits in fanes,182 and all errors not according to knowledge, shall find no help from
them.” But Isaiah183 says, “Ye are witnesses whether there is a God except Me.” “And they
who mould and carve out at that time were not: all vain! who do that which liketh them,
which shall not profit them!” And that whole ensuing discourse sets a ban as well on the
artificers as the worshippers: the close of which is, “Learn that their heart is ashes and earth,
and that none can free his own soul.” In which sentence David equally includes the makers
too. “Such,” says he, “let them become who make them.”184 And why should I, a man of
<note type="footnote">179 Lev. xxvi. 1; Ex. xx. 4; Deut. v. 8. It must of course be borne in mind that Tertullian has defined the

“perdition of blood” must be taken as equivalent to “bloody perdition,” after the Hebrew fashion. Compare, for
similar instances, 2 Sam. xvi. 7; Ps. v. 6; xxvi. 9; lv. 23; Ezek. xxii. 2, with the marginal readings. But Fr. Junius

<head>Chapter V.185—Sundry Objections or Excuses Dealt with.</head>
<p>We will certainly take more pains in answering the excuses of artificers of this kind,
who ought never to be admitted into the house of God, if any have a knowledge of that
Discipline.186 To begin with, that speech, wont to be cast in our teeth, “I have nothing else
whereby to live,” may be more severely retorted, “You have, then, whereby to live? If by
your own laws, what have you to do with God?”187 Then, as to the argument they have the
hardihood to bring even from the Scriptures, “that the apostle has said, ‘As each has been
found, so let him persevere.’”188 We may all, therefore, persevere in sins, as the result of
that interpretation! for there is not any one of us who has not been found as a sinner, since
no other cause was the source of Christ’s descent than that of setting sinners free. Again,
they say the same apostle has left a precept, according to his own example, “That each one
work with his own hands for a living.”189 If this precept is maintained in respect to all hands,
I believe even the bath-thieves190 live by their hands, and robbers themselves gain the means
to live by their hands; forgers, again, execute their evil handwritings, not of course with their
feet, but hands; actors, however, achieve a livelihood not with hands alone, but with their
entire limbs. Let the Church, therefore, stand open to all who are supported by their hands
and by their own work; if there is no exception of arts which the Discipline of God receives
not. But some one says, in opposition to our proposition of “similitude being interdicted,”
“Why, then, did Moses in the desert make a likeness of a serpent out of bronze?” The figures,
which used to be laid as a groundwork for some secret future dispensation, not with a view
to the repeal of the law, but as a type of their own final cause, stand in a class by themselves.
Otherwise, if we should interpret these things as the adversaries of the law do, do we, too,
as the Marcionites do, ascribe inconsistency to the Almighty, whom they191 in this manner
destroy as being mutable, while in one place He forbids, in another commands? But if any

<head>Chapter VI.—Idolatry Condemned by Baptism. To Make an Idol Is, in Fact, to
Worship It.</head>
<p>If no law of God had prohibited idols to be made by us; if no voice of the Holy Spirit
uttered general menace no less against the makers than the worshippers of idols; from our
sacrament itself we would draw our interpretation that arts of that kind are opposed to the
faith. For how have we renounced the devil and his angels, if we make them? What divorce
have we declared from them, I say not with whom, but dependent on whom, we live? What
discord have we entered into with those to whom we are under obligation for the sake of
our maintenance? Can you have denied with the tongue what with the hand you confess?
unmake by word what by deed you make? preach one God, you who make so many? preach
the true God, you who make false ones? “I make,” says one, “but I worship not;” as if there
were some cause for which he dare not worship, besides that for which he ought not also to
make,—the offence done to God, namely, in either case. Nay, you who make, that they may
be able to be worshipped, do worship; and you worship, not with the spirit of some worthless
perfume, but with your own; nor at the expense of a beast’s soul, but of your own. To them
you immolate your ingenuity; to them you make your sweat a libation; to them you kindle
the torch of your forethought. More are you to them than a priest, since it is by your means
they have a priest; your diligence is their divinity.199 Do you affirm that you worship not
what you make? Ah! but they affirm not so, to whom you slay this fatter, more precious and
greater victim, your salvation.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—Grief of the Faithful at the Admission of Idol-Makers into the Church;
Nay, Even into the Ministry.</head>
<p>A whole day the zeal of faith will direct its pleadings to this quarter: bewailing that a
Christian should come from idols into the Church; should come from an adversary workshop
into the house of God; should raise to God the Father hands which are the mothers of idols;
should pray to God with the hands which, out of doors, are prayed to in opposition to God;
should apply to the Lord’s body those hands which confer bodies on demons. Nor is this
sufficient. Grant that it be a small matter, if from other hands they receive what they contaminate;
but even those very hands deliver to others what they have contaminated. Idolartificers
are chosen even into the ecclesiastical order. Oh wickedness! Once did the Jews
lay brands on Christ; these mangle His body daily. Oh hands to be cut off! Now let the
saying, “If thy hand make thee do evil, amputate it,”200 see to it whether it were uttered by
way of similitude merely. What hands more to be amputated than those in which scandal
is done to the Lord’s body?</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Other Arts Made Subservient to Idolatry. Lawful Means of Gaining
a Livelihood Abundant.</head>
<p>There are also other species of very many arts which, although they extend not to the
making of idols, yet, with the same criminality, furnish the adjuncts without which idols
have no power. For it matters not whether you erect or equip: if you have embellished his
temple, altar, or niche; if you have pressed out gold-leaf, or have wrought his insignia, or
even his house: work of that kind, which confers not shape, but authority, is more important.
If the necessity of maintenance201 is urged so much, the arts have other species withal to
afford means of livelihood, without outstepping the path of discipline, that is, without the
confiction of an idol. The plasterer knows both how to mend roofs, and lay on stuccoes,
and polish a cistern, and trace ogives, and draw in relief on party-walls many other ornaments
beside likenesses. The painter, too, the marble mason, the bronze-worker, and every graver
whatever, knows expansions202 of his own art, of course much easier of execution. For how
much more easily does he who delineates a statue overlay a sideboard!203 How much
sooner does he who carves a Mars out of a lime-tree, fasten together a chest! No art but is
either mother or kinswoman of some neighbour204 art: nothing is independent of its
neighbour. The veins of the arts are many as are the concupiscences of men. “But there is
difference in wages and the rewards of handicraft;” therefore there is difference, too, in the
labour required. Smaller wages are compensated by more frequent earning. How many are
the party-walls which require statues? How many the temples and shrines which are built
for idols? But houses, and official residences, and baths, and tenements, how many are they?
Shoe- and slipper-gilding is daily work; not so the gilding of Mercury and Serapis. Let that
suffice for the gain205 of handicrafts. Luxury and ostentation have more votaries than all
superstition. Ostentation will require dishes and cups more easily than superstition. Luxury
deals in wreaths, also, more than ceremony. When, therefore, we urge men generally to such
kinds of handicrafts as do not come in contact with an idol indeed and with the things which
are appropriate to an idol; since, moreover, the things which are common to idols are often
common to men too; of this also we ought to beware that nothing be, with our knowledge,
demanded by any person from our idols’ service. For if we shall have made that concession,

<head>Chapter IX.—Professions of Some Kinds Allied to Idolatry. Of Astrology in Particular.</head>
<p>We observe among the arts207 also some professions liable to the charge of idolatry. Of
astrologers there should be no speaking even;208 but since one in these days has challenged
us, defending on his own behalf perseverance in that profession, I will use a few words. I
allege not that he honours idols, whose names he has inscribed on the heaven,209 to whom
he has attributed all God’s power; because men, presuming that we are disposed of by the
immutable arbitrament of the stars, think on that account that God is not to be sought after.
One proposition I lay down: that those angels, the deserters from God, the lovers of women,
210 were likewise the discoverers of this curious art, on that account also condemned
by God. Oh divine sentence, reaching even unto the earth in its vigour, whereto the unwitting
render testimony! The astrologers are expelled just like their angels. The city and Italy are
interdicted to the astrologers, just as heaven to their angels.211 There is the same penalty of
exclusion for disciples and masters. “But Magi and astrologers came from the east.”212 We
know the mutual alliance of magic and astrology. The interpreters of the stars, then, were
the first to announce Christ’s birth the first to present Him “gifts.” By this bond, [must] I
imagine, they put Christ under obligation to themselves? What then? Shall therefore the
religion of those Magi act as patron now also to astrologers? Astrology now-a-days, forsooth,
treats of Christ—is the science of the stars of Christ; not of Saturn, or Mars, and whomsoever
else out of the same class of the dead213 it pays observance to and preaches? But, however,
that science has been allowed until the Gospel, in order that after Christ’s birth no one
should thence forward interpret any one’s nativity by the heaven. For they therefore offered
to the then infant Lord that frankincense and myrrh and gold, to be, as it were, the close of
worldly214 sacrifice and glory, which Christ was about to do away. What, then? The
dream—sent, doubtless, of the will of God—suggested to the same Magi, namely, that they
should go home, but by another way, not that by which they came. It means this: that they

should not walk in their ancient path.215 Not that Herod should not pursue them, who in
fact did not pursue them; unwitting even that they had departed by another way, since he
was withal unwitting by what way they came. Just so we ought to understand by it the right
Way and Discipline. And so the precept was rather, that thence forward they should walk
otherwise. So, too, that other species of magic which operates by miracles, emulous even in
opposition to Moses,216 tried God’s patience until the Gospel. For thenceforward Simon
Magus, just turned believer, (since he was still thinking somewhat of his juggling sect; to
wit, that among the miracles of his profession he might buy even the gift of the Holy Spirit
through imposition of hands) was cursed by the apostles, and ejected from the faith.217 Both
he and that other magician, who was with Sergius Paulus, (since he began opposing himself
to the same apostles) was mulcted with loss of eyes.218 The same fate, I believe, would astrologers,
too, have met, if any had fallen in the way of the apostles. But yet, when magic is
punished, of which astrology is a species, of course the species is condemned in the genus.
After the Gospel, you will nowhere find either sophists, Chaldeans, enchanters, diviners, or
magicians, except as clearly punished. “Where is the wise, where the grammarian, where
the disputer of this age? Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this age?”219 You know
nothing, astrologer, if you know not that you should be a Christian. If you did know it, you
ought to have known this also, that you should have nothing more to do with that profession
of yours which, of itself, fore-chants the climacterics of others, and might instruct you of
its own danger. There is no part nor lot for you in that system of yours.220 He cannot hope

<head>Chapter X.—Of Schoolmasters and Their Difficulties.</head>
<p>Moreover, we must inquire likewise touching schoolmasters; nor only of them, but also
all other professors of literature. Nay, on the contrary, we must not doubt that they are in
affinity with manifold idolatry: first, in that it is necessary for them to preach the gods of
the nations, to express their names, genealogies, honourable distinctions, all and singular;
and further, to observe the solemnities and festivals of the same, as of them by whose means
they compute their revenues. What schoolmaster, without a table of the seven idols,222 will
yet frequent the Quinquatria? The very first payment of every pupil he consecrates both to
the honour and to the name of Minerva; so that, even though he be not said “to eat of that
which is sacrificed to idols”223 nominally (not being dedicated to any particular idol), he is
shunned as an idolater. What less of defilement does he recur on that ground,224 than a
business brings which, both nominally and virtually, is consecrated publicly to an idol? The
Minervalia are as much Minerva’s, as the Saturnalia Saturn’s; Saturn’s, which must necessarily
be celebrated even by little slaves at the time of the Saturnalia. New-year’s gifts likewise
must be caught at, and the Septimontium kept; and all the presents of Midwinter and the
feast of Dear Kinsmanship must be exacted; the schools must be wreathed with flowers; the
flamens’ wives and the ædiles sacrifice; the school is honoured on the appointed holy-days.
The same thing takes place on an idol’s birthday; every pomp of the devil is frequented.
Who will think that these things are befitting to a Christian master,225 unless it be he who
shall think them suitable likewise to one who is not a master? We know it may be said, “If
teaching literature is not lawful to God’s servants, neither will learning be likewise;” and,
“How could one be trained unto ordinary human intelligence, or unto any sense or action
whatever, since literature is the means of training for all life? How do we repudiate secular
studies, without which divine studies cannot be pursued?” Let us see, then, the necessity of
literary erudition; let us reflect that partly it cannot be admitted, partly cannot be avoided.
Learning literature is allowable for believers, rather than teaching; for the principle of
learning and of teaching is different. If a believer teach literature, while he is teaching
doubtless he commends, while he delivers he affirms, while he recalls he bears testimony

to, the praises of idols interspersed therein. He seals the gods themselves with this name;226
whereas the Law, as we have said, prohibits “the names of gods to be pronounced,”227 and
this name228 to be conferred on vanity.229 Hence the devil gets men’s early faith built up
from the beginnings of their erudition. Inquire whether he who catechizes about idols
commit idolatry. But when a believer learns these things, if he is already capable of understanding
what idolatry is, he neither receives nor allows them; much more if he is not yet
capable. Or, when he begins to understand, it behoves him first to understand what he has
previously learned, that is, touching God and the faith. Therefore he will reject those things,
and will not receive them; and will be as safe as one who from one who knows it not,
knowingly accepts poison, but does not drink it. To him necessity is attributed as an excuse,
because he has no other way to learn. Moreover, the not teaching literature is as much easier
than the not learning, as it is easier, too, for the pupil not to attend, than for the master not
to frequent, the rest of the defilements incident to the schools from public and scholastic
solemnities.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—Connection Between Covetousness and Idolatry. Certain Trades,
However Gainful, to Be Avoided.</head>
<p>If we think over the rest of faults, tracing them from their generations, let us begin with
covetousness, “a root of all evils,”230 wherewith, indeed, some having been ensnared, “have
suffered shipwreck about faith.”231 Albeit covetousness is by the same apostle called idolatry.
232 In the next place proceeding to mendacity, the minister of covetousness (of false
swearing I am silent, since even swearing is not lawful233)—is trade adapted for a servant
of God? But, covetousness apart, what is the motive for acquiring? When the motive for
acquiring ceases, there will be no necessity for trading. Grant now that there be some
righteousness in business, secure from the duty of watchfulness against covetousness and
mendacity; I take it that that trade which pertains to the very soul and spirit of idols, which
pampers every demon, falls under the charge of idolatry. Rather, is not that the principal
idolatry? If the selfsame merchandises—frankincense, I mean, and all other foreign productions—
used as sacrifice to idols, are of use likewise to men for medicinal ointments, to us
Christians also, over and above, for solaces of sepulture, let them see to it. At all events, while
the pomps, while the priesthoods, while the sacrifices of idols, are furnished by dangers, by
losses, by inconveniences, by cogitations, by runnings to and fro, or trades, what else are
you demonstrated to be but an idols’ agent? Let none contend that, in this way, exception
may be taken to all trades. All graver faults extend the sphere for diligence in watchfulness
proportionably to the magnitude of the danger; in order that we may withdraw not only
from the faults, but from the means through which they have being. For although the fault
be done by others, it makes no difference if it be by my means. In no case ought I to be necessary
to another, while he is doing what to me is unlawful. Hence I ought to understand
that care must be taken by me, lest what I am forbidden to do be done by my means. In
short, in another cause of no lighter guilt I observe that fore-judgment. In that I am interdicted
from fornication, I furnish nothing of help or connivance to others for that purpose;
in that I have separated my own flesh itself from stews, I acknowledge that I cannot exercise
the trade of pandering, or keep that kind of places for my neighbour’s behoof. So, too, the
interdiction of murder shows me that a trainer of gladiators also is excluded from the Church;
nor will any one fail to be the means of doing what he subministers to another to do. Behold,
here is a more kindred fore-judgment: if a purveyor of the public victims come over to the
faith, will you permit him to remain permanently in that trade? or if one who is already a

believer shall have undertaken that business, will you think that he is to be retained in the
Church? No, I take it; unless any one will dissemble in the case of a frankincense-seller too.
In sooth, the agency of blood pertains to some, that of odours to others. If, before idols were
in the world, idolatry, hitherto shapeless, used to be transacted by these wares; if, even now,
the work of idolatry is perpetrated, for the most part, without the idol, by burnings of odours;
the frankincense-seller is a something even more serviceable even toward demons, for idolatry
is more easily carried on without the idol, than without the ware of the frankincense-seller.234
Let us interrogate thoroughly the conscience of the faith itself. With what mouth will a
Christian frankincense-seller, if he shall pass through temples, with what mouth will he spit
down upon and blow out the smoking altars, for which himself has made provision? With
what consistency will he exorcise his own foster-children,235 to whom he affords his own
house as store-room? Indeed, if he shall have ejected a demon,236 let him not congratulate
himself on his faith, for he has not ejected an enemy; he ought to have had his prayer easily
granted by one whom he is daily feeding.237 No art, then, no profession, no trade, which
administers either to equipping or forming idols, can be free from the title of idolatry; unless
we interpret idolatry to be altogether something else than the service of idol-tendence.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Further Answers to the Plea, How Am I to Live?</head>
<p>In vain do we flatter ourselves as to the necessities of human maintenance, if—after
faith sealed238—we say, “I have no means to live?”239 For here I will now answer more fully
that abrupt proposition. It is advanced too late. For after the similitude of that most prudent
builder,240 who first computes the costs of the work, together with his own means, lest,
when he has begun, he afterwards blush to find himself spent, deliberation should have been
made before. But even now you have the Lord’s sayings, as examples taking away from you
all excuse. For what is it you say? “I shall be in need.” But the Lord calls the needy “happy.”241
“I shall have no food.” But “think not,” says He, “about food;”242 and as an example of
clothing we have the lilies.243 “My work was my subsistence.” Nay, but “all things are to be
sold, and divided to the needy.”244 “But provision must be made for children and posterity.”
“None, putting his hand on the plough, and looking back, is fit” for work.245 “But I was
under contract.” “None can serve two lords.”246 If you wish to be the Lord’s disciple, it is
necessary you “take your cross, and follow the Lord:”247 your cross; that is, your own straits
and tortures, or your body only, which is after the manner of a cross. Parents, wives, children,
will have to be left behind, for God’s sake.248 Do you hesitate about arts, and trades, and
about professions likewise, for the sake of children and parents? Even there was it demonstrated
to us, that both “dear pledges,”249 and handicrafts, and trades, are to be quite left
behind for the Lord’s sake; while James and John, called by the Lord, do leave quite behind
both father and ship;250 while Matthew is roused up from the toll-booth;251 while even
burying a father was too tardy a business for faith.252 None of them whom the Lord chose

to Him said, “I have no means to live.” Faith fears not famine. It knows, likewise, that hunger
is no less to be contemned by it for God’s sake, than every kind of death. It has learnt not
to respect life; how much more food? [You ask] “How many have fulfilled these conditions?”
But what with men is difficult, with God is easy.253 Let us, however, comfort ourselves about
the gentleness and clemency of God in such wise, as not to indulge our “necessities” up to
the point of affinities with idolatry, but to avoid even from afar every breath of it, as of a
pestilence. [And this] not merely in the cases forementioned, but in the universal series of
human superstition; whether appropriated to its gods, or to the defunct, or to kings, as
pertaining to the selfsame unclean spirits, sometimes through sacrifices and priesthoods,
sometimes through spectacles and the like, sometimes through holy-days.</p>

<p>But why speak of sacrifices and priesthoods? Of spectacles, moreover, and pleasures of
that kind, we have already filled a volume of their own.254 In this place must be handled the
subject of holidays and other extraordinary solemnities, which we accord sometimes to our
wantonness, sometimes to our timidity, in opposition to the common faith and Discipline.
The first point, indeed, on which I shall join issue is this: whether a servant of God ought
to share with the very nations themselves in matters of his kind either in dress, or in food,
or in any other kind of their gladness. “To rejoice with the rejoicing, and grieve with the
grieving,”255 is said about brethren by the apostle when exhorting to unanimity. But, for
these purposes, “There is nought of communion between light and darkness,”256 between
life and death or else we rescind what is written, “The world shall rejoice, but ye shall
grieve.”257 If we rejoice with the world, there is reason to fear that with the world we shall
grieve too. But when the world rejoices, let us grieve; and when the world afterward grieves,
we shall rejoice. Thus, too, Eleazar258 in Hades,259 (attaining refreshment in Abraham’s
bosom) and the rich man, (on the other hand, set in the torment of fire) compensate, by an
answerable retribution, their alternate vicissitudes of evil and good. There are certain giftdays,
which with some adjust the claim of honour, with others the debt of wages. “Now,
then,” you say, “I shall receive back what is mine, or pay back what is another’s.” If men
have consecrated for themselves this custom from superstition, why do you, estranged as
you are from all their vanity, participate in solemnities consecrated to idols; as if for you
also there were some prescript about a day, short of the observance of a particular day, to
prevent your paying or receiving what you owe a man, or what is owed you by a man? Give
me the form after which you wish to be dealt with. For why should you skulk withal, when
you contaminate your own conscience by your neighbour’s ignorance? If you are not unknown
to be a Christian, you are tempted, and you act as if you were not a Christian against
your neighbour’s conscience; if, however, you shall be disguised withal,260 you are the slave

<head>Chapter XIV.—Of Blasphemy. One of St. Paul’s Sayings.</head>
<p>But, however, the majority (of Christians) have by this time induced the belief in their
mind that it is pardonable if at any time they do what the heathen do, for fear “the Name
be blasphemed.” Now the blasphemy which must quite be shunned by us in every way is, I
take it, this: If any of us lead a heathen into blasphemy with good cause, either by fraud, or
by injury, or by contumely, or any other matter of worthy complaint, in which “the Name”
is deservedly impugned, so that the Lord, too, be deservedly angry. Else, if of all blasphemy
it has been said, “By your means My Name is blasphemed,”263 we all perish at once; since
the whole circus, with no desert of ours, assails “the Name” with wicked suffrages. Let us
cease (to be Christians) and it will not be blasphemed! On the contrary, while we are, let it
be blasphemed: in the observance, not the overstepping, of discipline; while we are being
approved, not while we are being reprobated. Oh blasphemy, bordering on martyrdom,
which now attests me to be a Christian,264 while for that very account it detests me! The
cursing of well-maintained Discipline is a blessing of the Name. “If,” says he, “I wished to
please men, I should not be Christ’s servant.”265 But the same apostle elsewhere bids us take
care to please all: “As I,” he says, “please all by all means.”266 No doubt he used to please
them by celebrating the Saturnalia and New-year’s day! [Was it so] or was it by moderation
and patience? by gravity, by kindness, by integrity? In like manner, when he is saying, “I
have become all things to all, that I may gain all,”267 does he mean “to idolaters an idolater?”
“to heathens a heathen?” “to the worldly worldly?” But albeit he does not prohibit us from
having our conversation with idolaters and adulterers, and the other criminals, saying,
“Otherwise ye would go out from the world,”268 of course he does not so slacken those reins
of conversation that, since it is necessary for us both to live and to mingle with sinners, we
may be able to sin with them too. Where there is the intercourse of life, which the apostle
concedes, there is sinning, which no one permits. To live with heathens is lawful, to die with
them269 is not. Let us live with all;270 let us be glad with them, out of community of nature,
not of superstition. We are peers in soul, not in discipline; fellow-possessors of the world,
not of error. But if we have no right of communion in matters of this kind with strangers,

how far more wicked to celebrate them among brethren! Who can maintain or defend this?
The Holy Spirit upbraids the Jews with their holy-days. “Your Sabbaths, and new moons,
and ceremonies,” says He, “My soul hateth.”271 By us, to whom Sabbaths are strange,272
and the new moons and festivals formerly beloved by God, the Saturnalia and New-year’s
and Midwinter’s festivals and Matronalia are frequented—presents come and go—Newyear’s
gifts—games join their noise—banquets join their din! Oh better fidelity of the nations
to their own sect, which claims no solemnity of the Christians for itself! Not the Lord’s day,
not Pentecost, even if they had known them, would they have shared with us; for they would
fear lest they should seem to be Christians. We are not apprehensive lest we seem to be
heathens! If any indulgence is to be granted to the flesh, you have it. I will not say your own
days,273 but more too; for to the heathens each festive day occurs but once annually: you
have a festive day every eighth day.274 Call out the individual solemnities of the nations,
and set them out into a row, they will not be able to make up a Pentecost.275</p>

<p>But “let your works shine,” saith He;276 but now all our shops and gates shine! You will
now-a-days find more doors of heathens without lamps and laurel-wreaths than of Christians.
What does the case seem to be with regard to that species (of ceremony) also? If it is an
idol’s honour, without doubt an idol’s honour is idolatry. If it is for a man’s sake, let us again
consider that all idolatry is for man’s sake;277 let us again consider that all idolatry is a
worship done to men, since it is generally agreed even among their worshippers that aforetime
the gods themselves of the nations were men; and so it makes no difference whether that
superstitious homage be rendered to men of a former age or of this. Idolatry is condemned,
not on account of the persons which are set up for worship, but on account of those its observances,
which pertain to demons. “The things which are Cæsar’s are to be rendered to
Cæsar.”278 It is enough that He set in apposition thereto, “and to God the things which are
God’s.” What things, then, are Cæsar’s? Those, to wit, about which the consultation was
then held, whether the poll-tax should be furnished to Cæsar or no. Therefore, too, the Lord
demanded that the money should be shown Him, and inquired about the image, whose it
was; and when He had heard it was Cæsar’s, said, “Render to Cæsar what are Cæsar’s, and
what are God’s to God;” that is, the image of Cæsar, which is on the coin, to Cæsar, and the
image of God, which is on man,279 to God; so as to render to Cæsar indeed money, to God
yourself. Otherwise, what will be God’s, if all things are Cæsar’s? “Then,” do you say, “the
lamps before my doors, and the laurels on my posts are an honour to God?” They are there
of course, not because they are an honour to God, but to him who is honour in God’s stead
by ceremonial observances of that kind, so far as is manifest, saving the religious performance,
which is in secret appertaining to demons. For we ought to be sure if there are any whose
notice it escapes through ignorance of this world’s literature, that there are among the Romans
even gods of entrances; Cardea (Hinge-goddess), called after hinges, and Forculus
(Door-god) after doors, and Limentinus (Threshold-god) after the threshold, and Janus
himself (Gate-god) after the gate: and of course we know that, though names be empty and
feigned, yet, when they are drawn down into superstition, demons and every unclean spirit
seize them for themselves, through the bond of consecration. Otherwise demons have no
name individually, but they there find a name where they find also a token. Among the
Greeks likewise we read of Apollo Thyræus, i.e. of the door, and the Antelii, or Anthelii,
demons, as presiders over entrances. These things, therefore, the Holy Spirit foreseeing from

the beginning, fore-chanted, through the most ancient prophet Enoch, that even entrances
would come into superstitious use. For we see too that other entrances280 are adored in the
baths. But if there are beings which are adored in entrances, it is to them that both the lamps
and the laurels will pertain. To an idol you will have done whatever you shall have done to
an entrance. In this place I call a witness on the authority also of God; because it is not safe
to suppress whatever may have been shown to one, of course for the sake of all. I know that
a brother was severely chastised, the same night, through a vision, because on the sudden
announcement of public rejoicings his servants had wreathed his gates. And yet himself
had not wreathed, or commanded them to be wreathed; for he had gone forth from home
before, and on his return had reprehended the deed. So strictly are we appraised with God
in matters of this kind, even with regard to the discipline of our family.281 Therefore, as to
what relates to the honours due to kings or emperors, we have a prescript sufficient, that it
behoves us to be in all obedience, according to the apostle’s precept,282 “subject to magistrates,
and princes, and powers;”283 but within the limits of discipline, so long as we keep
ourselves separate from idolatry. For it is for this reason, too, that that example of the three
brethren has forerun us, who, in other respects obedient toward king Nebuchodonosor rejected
with all constancy the honour to his image,284 proving that whatever is extolled beyond
the measure of human honour, unto the resemblance of divine sublimity, is idolatry. So
too, Daniel, in all other points submissive to Darius, remained in his duty so long as it was
free from danger to his religion;285 for, to avoid undergoing that danger, he feared the royal
lions no more than they the royal fires. Let, therefore, them who have no light, light their
lamps daily; let them over whom the fires of hell are imminent, affix to their posts, laurels
doomed presently to burn: to them the testimonies of darkness and the omens of their
penalties are suitable. You are a light of the world,286 and a tree ever green.287 If you have
renounced temples, make not your own gate a temple. I have said too little. If you have renounced
stews, clothe not your own house with the appearance of a new brothel.</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—Concerning Private Festivals.</head>
<p>Touching the ceremonies, however, of private and social solemnities—as those of the
white toga, of espousals, of nuptials, of name-givings—I should think no danger need be
guarded against from the breath of the idolatry which is mixed up with them. For the causes
are to be considered to which the ceremony is due. Those above-named I take to be clean
in themselves, because neither manly garb, nor the marital ring or union, descends from
honours done to any idol. In short, I find no dress cursed by God, except a woman’s dress
on a man:288 for “cursed,” saith He, “is every man who clothes himself in woman’s attire.”
The toga, however, is a dress of manly name as well as of manly use.289 God no more prohibits
nuptials to be celebrated than a name to be given. “But there are sacrifices appropriated
to these occasions.” Let me be invited, and let not the title of the ceremony be “assistance
at a sacrifice,” and the discharge of my good offices is at the service of my friends. Would
that it were “at their service” indeed, and that we could escape seeing what is unlawful for
us to do. But since the evil one has so surrounded the world with idolatry, it will be lawful
for us to be present at some ceremonies which see us doing service to a man, not to an idol.
Clearly, if invited unto priestly function and sacrifice, I will not go, for that is service peculiar
to an idol; but neither will I furnish advice, or expense, or any other good office in a
matter of that kind. If it is on account of the sacrifice that I be invited, and stand by, I shall
be partaker of idolatry; if any other cause conjoins me to the sacrificer, I shall be merely a
spectator of the sacrifice.290</p>
<note type="footnote">288 Tertullian should have added, “and a man’s on a woman.” See Deut. xxii. 5. Moreover, the word “cursed”

<head>Chapter XVII.—The Cases of Servants and Other Officials. What Offices a Christian
Man May Hold.</head>
<p>But what shall believing servants or children291 do? officials likewise, when attending
on their lords, or patrons, or superiors, when sacrificing? Well, if any one shall have handed
the wine to a sacrificer, nay, if by any single word necessary or belonging to a sacrifice he
shall have aided him, he will be held to be a minister of idolatry. Mindful of this rule, we
can render service even “to magistrates and powers,” after the example of the patriarchs and
the other forefathers,292 who obeyed idolatrous kings up to the confine of idolatry. Hence
arose, very lately, a dispute whether a servant of God should take the administration of any
dignity or power, if he be able, whether by some special grace, or by adroitness, to keep
himself intact from every species of idolatry; after the example that both Joseph and Daniel,
clean from idolatry, administered both dignity and power in the livery and purple of the
prefecture of entire Egypt or Babylonia. And so let us grant that it is possible for any one to
succeed in moving, in whatsoever office, under the mere name of the office, neither sacrificing
nor lending his authority to sacrifices; not farming out victims; not assigning to others the
care of temples; not looking after their tributes; not giving spectacles at his own or the
public charge, or presiding over the giving them; making proclamation or edict for no
solemnity; not even taking oaths: moreover (what comes under the head of power), neither
sitting in judgment on any one’s life or character, for you might bear with his judging about
money; neither condemning nor fore-condemning;293 binding no one, imprisoning or torturing
no one—if it is credible that all this is possible.</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Dress as Connected with Idolatry.</head>
<p>But we must now treat of the garb only and apparatus of office. There is a dress proper
to every one, as well for daily use as for office and dignity. That famous purple, therefore,
and the gold as an ornament of the neck, were, among the Egyptians and Babylonians, ensigns
of dignity, in the same way as bordered, or striped, or palm-embroidered togas, and the
golden wreaths of provincial priests, are now; but not on the same terms. For they used only
to be conferred, under the name of honour, on such as deserved the familiar friendship of
kings (whence, too, such used to be styled the “purpled-men”294 of kings, just as among
us,295 some, from their white toga, are called “candidates”296); but not on the understanding
that that garb should be tied to priesthoods also, or to any idol-ceremonies. For if that were
the case, of course men of such holiness and constancy297 would instantly have refused the
defiled dresses; and it would instantly have appeared that Daniel had been no zealous slave
to idols, nor worshipped Bel, nor the dragon, which long after did appear. That purple,
therefore, was simple, and used not at that time to be a mark of dignity298 among the barbarians,
but of nobility.299 For as both Joseph, who had been a slave, and Daniel, who
through300 captivity had changed his state, attained the freedom of the states of Babylon
and Egypt through the dress of barbaric nobility;301 so among us believers also, if need so
be, the bordered toga will be proper to be conceded to boys, and the stole to girls,302 as ensigns
of birth, not of power; of race, not of office; of rank, not of superstition. But the purple,
or the other ensigns of dignities and powers, dedicated from the beginning to idolatry engrafted
on the dignity and the powers, carry the spot of their own profanation; since,
moreover, bordered and striped togas, and broad-barred ones, are put even on idols themselves;
and fasces also, and rods, are borne before them; and deservedly, for demons are the
magistrates of this world: they bear the fasces and the purples, the ensigns of one college.
What end, then, will you advance if you use the garb indeed, but administer not the functions
of it? In things unclean, none can appear clean. If you put on a tunic defiled in itself, it perhaps
may not be defiled through you; but you, through it, will be unable to be clean. Now

by this time, you who argue about “Joseph” and “Daniel,” know that things old and new,
rude and polished, begun and developed, slavish and free, are not always comparable. For
they, even by their circumstances, were slaves; but you, the slave of none,303 in so far as you
are the slave of Christ alone,304 who has freed you likewise from the captivity of the world,
will incur the duty of acting after your Lord’s pattern. That Lord walked in humility and
obscurity, with no definite home: for “the Son of man,” said He, “hath not where to lay His
head;”305 unadorned in dress, for else He had not said, “Behold, they who are clad in soft
raiment are in kings’ houses:”306 in short, inglorious in countenance and aspect, just as
Isaiah withal had fore-announced.307 If, also, He exercised no right of power even over His
own followers, to whom He discharged menial ministry;308 if, in short, though conscious
of His own kingdom,309 He shrank back from being made a king,310 He in the fullest
manner gave His own an example for turning coldly from all the pride and garb, as well of
dignity as of power. For if they were to be used, who would rather have used them than the
Son of God? What kind and what number of fasces would escort Him? what kind of purple
would bloom from His shoulders? what kind of gold would beam from His head, had He
not judged the glory of the world to be alien both to Himself and to His? Therefore what
He was unwilling to accept, He has rejected; what He rejected, He has condemned; what
He condemned, He has counted as part of the devil’s pomp. For He would not have condemned
things, except such as were not His; but things which are not God’s, can be no
other’s but the devil’s. If you have forsworn “the devil’s pomp,”311 know that whatever there
you touch is idolatry. Let even this fact help to remind you that all the powers and dignities
of this world are not only alien to, but enemies of, God; that through them punishments
have been determined against God’s servants; through them, too, penalties prepared for the
impious are ignored. But “both your birth and your substance are troublesome to you in
resisting idolatry.”312 For avoiding it, remedies cannot be lacking; since, even if they be

<head>Chapter XIX.—Concerning Military Service.</head>
<p>In that last section, decision may seem to have been given likewise concerning military
service, which is between dignity and power.314 But now inquiry is made about this point,
whether a believer may turn himself unto military service, and whether the military may be
admitted unto the faith, even the rank and file, or each inferior grade, to whom there is no
necessity for taking part in sacrifices or capital punishments. There is no agreement between
the divine and the human sacrament,315 the standard of Christ and the standard of the
devil, the camp of light and the camp of darkness. One soul cannot be due to two masters—
God and Cæsar. And yet Moses carried a rod,316 and Aaron wore a buckle,317 and
John (Baptist) is girt with leather318 and Joshua the son of Nun leads a line of march; and
the People warred: if it pleases you to sport with the subject. But how will a Christian man
war, nay, how will he serve even in peace, without a sword, which the Lord has taken away?319
For albeit soldiers had come unto John, and had received the formula of their rule;320 albeit,
likewise, a centurion had believed;321 still the Lord afterward, in disarming Peter, unbe**d
every soldier. No dress is lawful among us, if assigned to any unlawful action.</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—Concerning Idolatry in Words.</head>
<p>But, however, since the conduct according to the divine rule is imperilled, not merely
by deeds, but likewise by words, (for, just as it is written, “Behold the man and his deeds;”322
so, “Out of thy own mouth shalt thou be justified”323), we ought to remember that, even in
words, also the inroad of idolatry must be foreguarded against, either from the defect of
custom or of timidity. The law prohibits the gods of the nations from being named,324 not
of course that we are not to pronounce their names, the speaking of which common intercourse
extorts from us: for this must very frequently be said, “You find him in the temple
of Æsculapius;” and, “I live in Isis Street;” and, “He has been made priest of Jupiter;” and
much else after this manner, since even on men names of this kind are bestowed. I do not
honour Saturnus if I call a man so, by his own name. I honour him no more than I do
Marcus, if I call a man Marcus. But it says, “Make not mention of the name of other gods,
neither be it heard from thy mouth.”325 The precept it gives is this, that we do not call them
gods. For in the first part of the law, too, “Thou shalt not,” saith He, “use the name of the
Lord thy God in a vain thing,”326 that is, in an idol.327 Whoever, therefore, honours an idol
with the name of God, has fallen into idolatry. But if I speak of them as gods, something
must be added to make it appear that I do not call them gods. For even the Scripture names
“gods,” but adds “their,” viz. “of the nations:” just as David does when he had named “gods,”
where he says, “But the gods of the nations are demons.”328 But this has been laid by me
rather as a foundation for ensuing observations. However, it is a defect of custom to say,
“By Hercules, So help me the god of faith;”329 while to the custom is added the ignorance of
some, who are ignorant that it is an oath by Hercules. Further, what will an oath be, in the
name of gods whom you have forsworn, but a collusion of faith with idolatry? For who does
not honour them in whose name he swears?</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—Of Silent Acquiescence in Heathen Formularies.</head>
<p>But it is a mark of timidity, when some other man binds you in the name of his gods,
by the making of an oath, or by some other form of attestation, and you, for fear of discovery,
330 remain quiet. For you equally, by remaining quiet, affirm their majesty, by reason
of which majesty you will seem to be bound. What matters it, whether you affirm the gods
of the nations by calling them gods, or by hearing them so called? Whether you swear by
idols, or, when adjured by another, acquiesce? Why should we not recognize the subtleties
of Satan, who makes it his aim that, what he cannot effect by our mouth, he may effect by
the mouth of his servants, introducing idolatry into us through our ears? At all events,
whoever the adjurer is, he binds you to himself either in friendly or unfriendly conjunction.
If in unfriendly, you are now challenged unto battle, and know that you must fight. If in
friendly, with how far greater security will you transfer your engagement unto the Lord,
that you may dissolve the obligation of him through whose means the Evil One was seeking
to annex you to the honour of idols, that is, to idolatry! All sufferance of that kind is idolatry.
You honour those to whom, when imposed as authorities, you have rendered respect. I
know that one (whom the Lord pardon!), when it had been said to him in public during a
law-suit, “Jupiter be wroth with you,” answered, “On the contrary, with you.” What else
would a heathen have done who believed Jupiter to be a god? For even had he not retorted
the malediction by Jupiter (or other such like), yet, by merely returning a curse, he would
have confirmed the divinity of Jove, showing himself irritated by a malediction in Jove’s
name. For what is there to be indignant at, (if cursed) in the name of one whom you know
to be nothing? For if you rave, you immediately affirm his existence, and the profession of
your fear will be an act of idolatry. How much more, while you are returning the malediction
in the name of Jupiter himself, are you doing honour to Jupiter in the same way as he who
provoked you! But a believer ought to laugh in such cases, not to rave; nay, according to the
precept,331 not to return a curse in the name of God even, but dearly to bless in the name
of God, that you may both demolish idols and preach God, and fulfil discipline.

<head>Chapter XXII.—Of Accepting Blessing in the Name of Idols.</head>
<p>Equally, one who has been initiated into Christ will not endure to be blessed in the name
of the gods of the nations, so as not always to reject the unclean benediction, and to cleanse
it out for himself by converting it Godward. To be blessed in the name of the gods of the
nations is to be cursed in the name of God. If I have given an alms, or shown any other
kindness, and the recipient pray that his gods, or the Genius of the colony, may be propitious
to me, my oblation or act will immediately be an honour to idols, in whose name he returns
me the favour of blessing. But why should he not know that I have done it for God’s sake;
that God may rather be glorified, and demons may not be honoured in that which I have
done for the sake of God? If God sees that I have done it for His sake, He equally sees that
I have been unwilling to show that I did it for His sake, and have in a manner made His
precept332 a sacrifice to idols. Many say, “No one ought to divulge himself;” but I think
neither ought he to deny himself. For whoever dissembles in any cause whatever, by being
held as a heathen, does deny; and, of course, all denial is idolatry, just as all idolatry is
denial, whether in deeds or in words.333</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Written Contracts in the Name of Idols. Tacit Consent.</head>
<p>But there is a certain species of that class, doubly sharpened in deed and word, and
mischievous on either side, although it flatter you, as if it were free of danger in each; while
it does not seem to be a deed, because it is not laid hold of as a word. In borrowing money
from heathens under pledged334 securities, Christians give a guarantee under oath, and
deny themselves to have done so. Of course, the time of the prosecution, and the place of
the judgment seat, and the person of the presiding judge, decide that they knew themselves
to have so done.335 Christ prescribes that there is to be no swearing. “I wrote,” says the
debtor, “but I said nothing. It is the tongue, not the written letter, which kills.” Here I call
Nature and Conscience as my witnesses: Nature, because even if the tongue in dictating remains
motionless and quiet, the hand can write nothing which the soul has not dictated;
albeit even to the tongue itself the soul may have dictated either something conceived by
itself, or else something delivered by another. Now, lest it be said, “Another dictated,” I here
appeal to Conscience whether, what another dictated, the soul entertains,336 and transmits
unto the hand, whether with the concomitance or the inaction of the tongue. Enough, that
the Lord has said faults are committed in the mind and the conscience. If concupiscence or
malice have ascended into a man’s heart, He saith it is held as a deed.337 You therefore have
given a guarantee; which clearly has “ascended into your heart,” which you can neither
contend you were ignorant of nor unwilling; for when you gave the guarantee, you knew
that you did it; when you knew, of course you were willing: you did it as well in act as in
thought; nor can you by the lighter charge exclude the heavier,338 so as to say that it is clearly
rendered false, by giving a guarantee for what you do not actually perform. “Yet I have not

reading, and given what appears to be his sense; but the readings are widely different, and it is doubtful whether
any is correct. I can scarcely, however, help thinking that the “se negant” here, and the “tamen non negavi” below,
are to be connected with the “puto autem nec negare” at the end of the former chapter; and that the true rendering
is rather: “And [by so doing] deny themselves,” i.e., deny their Christian name and faith. “Doubtless a time of
persecution,” such as the present time is—or “of prosecution,” which would make very good sense—“and the
place of the tribunal, and the person of the presiding judge, require them to know themselves,” i.e., to have no
shuffling or disguise. I submit this rendering with diffidence; but it does seem to me to suit the context better,
and to harmonize better with the “Yet I have not denied,” i.e., my name and faith, which follows, and with the
“denying letters” which are mentioned at the end of the chapter.—Tr.</note>

denied, because I have not sworn.” But you have sworn, since, even if you had done no such
thing, you would still be said to swear, if you have even consented to so doing. Silence of
voice is an unavailing plea in a case of writing; and muteness of sound in a case of letters.
For Zacharias, when punished with a temporary privation of voice, holds colloquy with his
mind, and, passing by his bootless tongue, with the help of his hands dictates from his heart,
and without his mouth pronounces the name of his son.339 Thus, in his pen there speaks a
hand clearer than every sound, in his waxen tablet there is heard a letter more vocal that
every mouth.340 Inquire whether a man have spoken who is understood to have spoken.341
Pray we the Lord that no necessity for that kind of contract may ever encompass us; and if
it should so fall out, may He give our brethren the means of helping us, or give us constancy
to break off all such necessity, lest those denying letters, the substitutes for our mouth, be
brought forward against us in the day of judgment, sealed with the seals, not now of witnesses,
but of angels!</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—General Conclusion.</head>
<p>Amid these reefs and inlets, amid these shallows and straits of idolatry, Faith, her sails
filled by the Spirit of God, navigates; safe if cautious, secure if intently watchful. But to such
as are washed overboard is a deep whence is no out-swimming; to such as are run aground
is inextricable shipwreck; to such as are engulphed is a whirlpool, where there is no breathing—
even in idolatry. All waves thereof whatsoever suffocate; every eddy thereof sucks
down unto Hades. Let no one say, “Who will so safely foreguard himself? We shall have to
go out of the world!”342 As if it were not as well worth while to go out, as to stand in the
world as an idolater! Nothing can be easier than caution against idolatry, if the fear of it be
our leading fear; any “necessity” whatever is too trifling compared to such a peril. The
reason why the Holy Spirit did, when the apostles at that time were consulting, relax the
bond and yoke for us,343 was that we might be free to devote ourselves to the shunning of
idolatry. This shall be our Law, the more fully to be administered the more ready it is to
hand; (a Law) peculiar to Christians, by means whereof we are recognised and examined
by heathens. This Law must be set before such as approach unto the Faith, and inculcated
on such as are entering it; that, in approaching, they may deliberate; observing it, may persevere;
not observing it, may renounce their name.344 We will see to it, if, after the type of
the Ark, there shall be in the Church raven, kite, dog, and serpent. At all events, an idolater
is not found in the type of the Ark: no animal has been fashioned to represent an idolater.
Let not that be in the Church which was not in the Ark.345</p>

<head>Elucidations.</head>

<p>I.
(The Second Commandment, p. 64.)</p>
<p>Tertullian’s teaching agrees with that of Clement of Alexandria346 and with all the
Primitive Fathers. But compare the Trent Catechism, (chapter ii., quest. 17.)—“Nor let any
one suppose that this commandment prohibits the arts of painting, modelling or sculpture,
for, in the Scriptures we are informed that God himself commanded images of cherubim,
and also of the brazen serpent, to be made, etc.” So far, the comparison is important, because
while our author limits any inference from this instance as an exception, this Catechism
turns it into a rule: and so far, we are only looking at the matter with reference to Art. But,
the Catechism, (quest. xxiii. xxiv.), goes on to teach that images of the Saints, etc. ought to
be made and honoured “as a holy practice.” It affirms, also, that it is a practice which has
been attended with the greatest advantage to the faithful: which admits of a doubt, especially
when the honour thus mentioned is everywhere turned into worship, precisely like that
offered to the Brazen Serpent, when the People “burned incense to it,” and often much more.
But even this is not my point; for that Catechism, with what verity need not be argued, affirms,
also, that this doctrine “derives confirmation from the monuments of the Apostolic
age, the general Councils of the Church, and the writings of so many most holy and learned
Fathers, who are of one accord upon the subject.” Doubtless they are “of one accord,” but all
the other way.</p>

<p>II.
(Military service, cap. xix., p. 73.)</p>
<p>This chapter must prepare us for a much more sweeping condemnation of the military
profession in the De Spectaculis and the De Corona; but Neander’s judgment seems to me
very just. The Corona, itself, is rather Montanistic than Montanist, in the opinion of some
critics, among whom Gibbon is not to count for much, for the reasons given by Kaye (p.
52), and others hardly less obvious. Surely, if this ascetic opinion and some similar instances
were enough to mark a man as a heretic, what are we to say of the thousand crotchets
maintained by good Christians, in our day?</p>
<note type="footnote">346 See vol. II., p. 186, this series.</note>

<pb n="156"/>
<p>III.
(Passive idolatry, cap. xxii., pp. 74, 75.)</p>
<p>Neander’s opinion as to the freedom of De Idololatria from Montanistic taint, is mildly
questioned by Bp. Kaye, chiefly on the ground of the agreement of this chapter with the
extravagances of the Scorpiace. He thinks “the utmost pitch” of such extravagance is reached
in the positions here taken. But Neander’s judgment seems to me preferable. Lapsers usually
give tokens of the bent of their minds, and unconsciously betray their inclinations before
they themselves see whither they are tending. Thus they become victims of their own
plausible self-deceptions.</p>
 
<p>IV.
(Tacit consents and reservations, cap. xxiii., p. 75.)</p>
<p>It cannot be doubted that apart from the specific case which Tertullian is here maintaining,
his appeal to conscience is maintained by reason, by the Morals of the Fathers and by
Holy Scripture. Now compare with this the Morality which has been made dogmatic, among
Latins, by the elevation of Liguori to the dignities of a “Saint” and a “Doctor of the Church.”
Even Cardinal Newman cannot accept it without reservations, so thoroughly does it commit
the soul to fraud and hypocrisy. See Liguori, Opp. Tom. II., pp. 34–44, and Meyrick, Moral
Theology of the Church of Rome, London, 1855. Republished, with an Introduction, by the
Editor of this Series, Baltimore, 1857. Also Newman, Apologia, p. 295 et seqq.</p>

<head>Chapter I.</head>
<p>Ye Servants of God, about to draw near to God, that you may make solemn consecration
of yourselves to Him,348 seek well to understand the condition of faith, the reasons of the
Truth, the laws of Christian Discipline, which forbid among other sins of the world, the
pleasures of the public shows. Ye who have testified and confessed349 that you have done
so already, review the subject, that there may be no sinning whether through real or wilful
ignorance. For such is the power of earthly pleasures, that, to retain the opportunity of still
partaking of them, it contrives to prolong a willing ignorance, and bribes knowledge into
playing a dishonest part. To both things, perhaps, some among you are allured by the views
of the heathens who in this matter are wont to press us with arguments, such as these: (1)
That the exquisite enjoyments of ear and eye we have in things external are not in the least
opposed to religion in the mind and conscience; and (2) That surely no offence is offered
to God, in any human enjoyment, by any of our pleasures, which it is not sinful to partake
of in its own time and place, with all due honour and reverence secured to Him. But this is
precisely what we are ready to prove: That these things are not consistent with true religion
and true obedience to the true God. There are some who imagine that Christians, a sort of
people ever ready to die, are trained into the abstinence they practise, with no other object
than that of making it less difficult to despise life, the fastenings to it being severed as it
were. They regard it as an art of quenching all desire for that which, so far as they are con-

in all probability. At all events, a work so colourless that doctors can disagree about even its shading,

cerned, they have emptied of all that is desirable; and so it is thought to be rather a thing of
human planning and foresight, than clearly laid down by divine command. It were a grievous
thing, forsooth, for Christians, while continuing in the enjoyment of pleasures so great, to
die for God! It is not as they say; though, if it were, even Christian obstinacy might well give
all submission to a plan so suitable, to a rule so excellent.</p>

<p>Then, again, every one is ready with the argument350 that all things, as we teach, were
created by God, and given to man for his use, and that they must be good, as coming all
from so good a source; but that among them are found the various constituent elements of
the public shows, such as the horse, the lion, bodily strength, and musical voice. It cannot,
then, be thought that what exists by God’s own creative will is either foreign or hostile to
Him; and if it is not opposed to Him, it cannot be regarded as injurious to His worshippers,
as certainly it is not foreign to them. Beyond all doubt, too, the very buildings connected
with the places of public amusement, composed as they are of rocks, stones, marbles, pillars,
are things of God, who has given these various things for the earth’s embellishment; nay,
the very scenes are enacted under God’s own heaven. How skilful a pleader seems human
wisdom to herself, especially if she has the fear of losing any of her delights—any of the
sweet enjoyments of worldly existence! In fact, you will find not a few whom the imperilling
of their pleasures rather than their life holds back from us. For even the weakling has no
strong dread of death as a debt he knows is due by him; while the wise man does not look
with contempt on pleasure, regarding it as a precious gift—in fact, the one blessedness of
life, whether to philosopher or fool. Now nobody denies what nobody is ignorant of—for
Nature herself is teacher of it—that God is the Maker of the universe, and that it is good,
and that it is man’s by free gift of its Maker. But having no intimate acquaintance with the
Highest, knowing Him only by natural revelation, and not as His “friends”—afar off, and
not as those who have been brought nigh to Him—men cannot but be in ignorance alike
of what He enjoins and what He forbids in regard to the administration of His world. They
must be ignorant, too, of the hostile power which works against Him, and perverts to wrong
uses the things His hand has formed; for you cannot know either the will or the adversary
of a God you do not know. We must not, then, consider merely by whom all things were
made, but by whom they have been perverted. We shall find out for what use they were
made at first, when we find for what they were not. There is a vast difference between the
corrupted state and that of primal purity, just because there is a vast difference between the
Creator and the corrupter. Why, all sorts of evils, which as indubitably evils even the heathens
prohibit, and against which they guard themselves, come from the works of God. Take, for
instance, murder, whether committed by iron, by poison, or by magical enchantments. Iron
and herbs and demons are all equally creatures of God. Has the Creator, withal, provided
these things for man’s destruction? Nay, He puts His interdict on every sort of man-killing
by that one summary precept, “Thou shalt not kill.” Moreover, who but God, the Maker of
the world, put in its gold, brass, silver, ivory, wood, and all the other materials used in the

manufacture of idols? Yet has He done this that men may set up a worship in opposition to
Himself? On the contrary idolatry in His eyes is the crowning sin. What is there offensive
to God which is not God’s? But in offending Him, it ceases to be His; and in ceasing to be
His, it is in His eyes an offending thing. Man himself, guilty as he is of every iniquity, is not
only a work of God—he is His image, and yet both in soul and body he has severed himself
from his Maker. For we did not get eyes to minister to lust, and the tongue for speaking evil
with, and ears to be the receptacle of evil speech, and the throat to serve the vice of gluttony,
and the belly to be gluttony’s ally, and the genitals for unchaste excesses, and hands for deeds
of violence, and the feet for an erring life; or was the soul placed in the body that it might
become a thought-manufactory of snares, and fraud, and injustice? I think not; for if God,
as the righteous ex-actor of innocence, hates everything like malignity—if He hates utterly
such plotting of evil, it is clear beyond a doubt, that, of all things that have come from His
hand, He has made none to lead to works which He condemns, even though these same
works may be carried on by things of His making; for, in fact, it is the one ground of condemnation,
that the creature misuses the creation. We, therefore, who in our knowledge of
the Lord have obtained some knowledge also of His foe—who, in our discovery of the Creator,
have at the same time laid hands upon the great corrupter, ought neither to wonder
nor to doubt that, as the prowess of the corrupting and God-opposing angel overthrew in
the beginning the virtue of man, the work and image of God, the possessor of the world, so
he has entirely changed man’s nature—created, like his own, for perfect sinlessness—into
his own state of wicked enmity against his Maker, that in the very thing whose gift to man,
but not to him, had grieved him, he might make man guilty in God’s eyes, and set up his
own supremacy.351</p>

<head>Chapter III.</head>
<p>Fortified by this knowledge against heathen views, let us rather turn to the unworthy
reasonings of our own people; for the faith of some, either too simple or too scrupulous,
demands direct authority from Scripture for giving up the shows, and holds out that the
matter is a doubtful one, because such abstinence is not clearly and in words imposed upon
God’s servants. Well, we never find it expressed with the same precision, “Thou shalt not
enter circus or theatre, thou shalt not look on combat or show;” as it is plainly laid down,
“Thou shalt not kill; thou shalt not worship an idol; thou shalt not commit adultery or
fraud.”352 But we find that that first word of David bears on this very sort of thing: “Blessed,”
he says, “is the man who has not gone into the assembly of the impious, nor stood in the
way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of scorners.”353 Though he seems to have predicted beforehand
of that just man, that he took no part in the meetings and deliberations of the Jews,
taking counsel about the slaying of our Lord, yet divine Scripture has ever far-reaching applications:
after the immediate sense has been exhausted, in all directions it fortifies the
practice of the religious life, so that here also you have an utterance which is not far from a
plain interdicting of the shows. If he called those few Jews an assembly of the wicked, how
much more will he so designate so vast a gathering of heathens! Are the heathens less impious,
less sinners, less enemies of Christ, than the Jews were then? And see, too, how other things
agree. For at the shows they also stand in the way. For they call the spaces between the seats
going round the amphitheatre, and the passages which separate the people running down,
ways. The place in the curve where the matrons sit is called a chair. Therefore, on the contrary,
it holds, unblessed is he who has entered any council of wicked men, and has stood
in any way of sinners, and has sat in any chair of scorners. We may understand a thing as
spoken generally, even when it requires a certain special interpretation to be given to it. For
some things spoken with a special reference contain in them general truth. When God admonishes
the Israelites of their duty, or sharply reproves them, He has surely a reference to
all men; when He threatens destruction to Egypt and Ethiopia, He surely pre-condemns
every sinning nation, whatever. If, reasoning from species to genus, every nation that sins
against them is an Egypt and Ethiopia; so also, reasoning from genus to species, with reference
to the origin of shows, every show is an assembly of the wicked.</p>

<p>Lest any one think that we are dealing in mere argumentative subtleties, I shall turn to
that highest authority of our “seal” itself. When entering the water, we make profession of
the Christian faith in the words of its rule; we bear public testimony that we have renounced
the devil, his pomp, and his angels. Well, is it not in connection with idolatry, above all, that
you have the devil with his pomp and his angels? from which, to speak briefly—for I do not
wish to dilate—you have every unclean and wicked spirit. If, therefore, it shall be made plain
that the entire apparatus of the shows is based upon idolatry, beyond all doubt that will
carry with it the conclusion that our renunciatory testimony in the laver of baptism has
reference to the shows, which, through their idolatry, have been given over to the devil, and
his pomp, and his angels. We shall set forth, then, their several origins, in what nursingplaces
they have grown to manhood; next the titles of some of them, by what names they
are called; then their apparatus, with what superstitions they are observed; (then their places,
to what patrons they are dedicated;) then the arts which minister to them, to what authors
they are traced. If any of these shall be found to have had no connection with an idol-god,
it will be held as free at once from the taint of idolatry, and as not coming within the range
of our baptismal abjuration.354</p>

<head>Chapter V.</head>
<p>In the matter of their origins, as these are somewhat obscure and but little known to
many among us, our investigations must go back to a remote antiquity, and our authorities
be none other than books of heathen literature. Various authors are extant who have published
works on the subject. The origin of the games as given by them is this. Timæus tells
us that immigrants from Asia, under the leadership of Tyrrhenus, who, in a contest about
his native kingdom, had succumbed to his brother, settled down in Etruria. Well, among
other superstitious observances under the name of religion, they set up in their new home
public shows. The Romans, at their own request, obtain from them skilled performers—the
proper seasons—the name too, for it is said they are called Ludi, from Lydi. And though
Varro derives the name of Ludi from Ludus, that is, from play, as they called the Luperci
also Ludii, because they ran about making sport; still that sporting of young men belongs,
in his view, to festal days and temples, and objects of religious veneration. However, it is of
little consequence the origin of the name, when it is certain that the thing springs from idolatry.
The Liberalia, under the general designation of Ludi, clearly declared the glory of
Father Bacchus; for to Bacchus these festivities were first consecrated by grateful peasants,
in return for the boon he conferred on them, as they say, making known the pleasures of
wine. Then the Consualia were called Ludi, and at first were in honour of Neptune, for
Neptune has the name of Consus also. Thereafter Romulus dedicated the Equiria to Mars,
though they claim the Consualia too for Romulus, on the ground that he consecrated them
to Consus, the god, as they will have it, of counsel; of the counsel, forsooth, in which he
planned the rape of the Sabine virgins for wives to his soldiers. An excellent counsel truly;
and still I suppose reckoned just and righteous by the Romans themselves, I may not say by
God. This goes also to taint the origin: you cannot surely hold that to be good which has
sprung from sin, from shamelessness, from violence, from hatred, from a fratricidal founder,
from a son of Mars. Even now, at the first turning-post in the circus, there is a subterranean
altar to this same Consus, with an inscription to this effect: “Consus, great in counsel, Mars,
in battle mighty tutelar deities.” The priests of the state sacrifice at it on the nones of July;
the priest of Romulus and the Vestals on the twelfth before the Kalends of September. In
addition to this, Romulus instituted games in honor of Jupiter Feretrius on the Tarpeian
Hill, according to the statement Piso has handed down to us, called both Tarpeian and
Capitoline. After him Numa Pompilius instituted games to Mars and Robigo (for they have
also invented a goddess of rust); then Tullus Hostilius; then Ancus Martius; and various
others in succession did the like. As to the idols in whose honour these games were established,
ample information is to be found in the pages of Suetonius Tranquillus. But we need
say no more to prove the accusation of idolatrous origin.</p>
</div>

 <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<pb n="164"/>
<head>Chapter VI.</head>
<p>To the testimony of antiquity is added that of later games instituted in their turn, and
betraying their origin from the titles which they bear even at the present day, in which it is
imprinted as on their very face, for what idol and for what religious object games, whether
of the one kind or the other, were designed. You have festivals bearing the name of the great
Mother355and Apollo of Ceres too, and Neptune, and Jupiter Latiaris, and Flora, all celebrated
for a common end; the others have their religious origin in the birthdays and solemnities
of kings, in public successes in municipal holidays. There are also testamentary exhibitions,
in which funeral honours are rendered to the memories of private persons; and this according
to an institution of ancient times. For from the first the “Ludi” were regarded as of two sons,
sacred and funereal, that is in honour of the heathen deities and of the dead. But in the
matter of idolatry, it makes no difference with us under what name or title it is practised,
while it has to do with the wicked spirits whom we abjure. If it is lawful to offer homage to
the dead, it will be just as lawful to offer it to their gods: you have the same origin in both
cases; there is the same idolatry; there is on our part the same solemn renunciation of all
idolatry.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.</head>
<p>The two kinds of public games, then, have one origin; and they have common names,
as owning the same parentage. So, too, as they are equally tainted with the sin of idolatry,
their foundress, they must needs be like each other in their pomp. But the more ambitious
preliminary display of the circus games to which the name procession specially belongs, is
in itself the proof to whom the whole thing appertains, in the many images the long line of
statues, the chariots of all sorts, the thrones, the crowns, the dresses. What high religious
rites besides, what sacrifices precede, come between, and follow. How many guilds, how
many priesthoods, how many offices are set astir, is known to the inhabitants of the great
city in which the demon convention has its headquarters. If these things are done in humbler
style in the provinces, in accordance with their inferior means, still all circus games must
be counted as belonging to that from which they are derived; the fountain from which they
spring defiles them. The tiny streamlet from its very spring-head, the little twig from its very
budding, contains in it the essential nature of its origin. It may be grand or mean, no matter,
any circus procession whatever is offensive to God. Though there be few images to grace
it, there is idolatry in one; though there be no more than a single sacred car, it is a chariot
of Jupiter: anything of idolatry whatever, whether meanly arrayed or modestly rich and
gorgeous, taints it in its origin.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="8">

<head>Chapter VIII.</head>
<p>To follow out my plan in regard to places: the circus is chiefly consecrated to the Sun,
whose temple stands in the middle of it, and whose image shines forth from its temple
summit; for they have not thought it proper to pay sacred honours underneath a roof to an
83object they have itself in open space. Those who assert that the first spectacle was exhibited
by Circe, and in honour of the Sun her father, as they will have it, maintain also the name
of circus was derived from her. Plainly, then, the enchantress did this in the name of the
parties whose priestess she was—I mean the demons and spirits of evil. What an aggregation
of idolatries you see, accordingly, in the decoration of the place! Every ornament of the circus
is a temple by itself. The eggs are regarded as sacred to the Castors, by men who are not
ashamed to profess faith in their production from the egg of a swan, which was no other
than Jupiter himself. The Dolphins vomit forth in honour of Neptune. Images of Sessia, so
called as the goddess of sowing; of Messia, so called as the goddess of reaping; of Tutulina,
so called as the fruit-protecting deity—load the pillars. In front of these you have three altars
to these three gods—Great, Mighty, Victorious. They reckon these of Samo-Thrace. The
huge Obelisk, as Hermeteles affirms, is set up in public to the Sun; its inscription, like its
origin, belongs to Egyptian superstition. Cheerless were the demon-gathering without their
Mater Magna; and so she presides there over the Euripus. Consus, as we have mentioned,
lies hidden under ground at the Murcian Goals. These two sprang from an idol. For they
will have it that Murcia is the goddess of love; and to her, at that spot, they have consecrated
a temple. See, Christian, how many impure names have taken possession of the circus! You
have nothing to do with a sacred place which is tenanted by such multitudes of diabolic
spirits. And speaking of places, this is the suitable occasion for some remarks in anticipation
of a point that some will raise. What, then, you say; shall I be in danger of pollution if I go
to the circus when the games are not being celebrated? There is no law forbidding the mere
places to us. For not only the places for show-gatherings, but even the temples, may be
entered without any peril of his religion by the servant of God, if he has only some honest
reason for it, unconnected with their proper business and official duties. Why, even the
streets and the market-place, and the baths, and the taverns, and our very dwelling-places,
are not altogether free from idols. Satan and his angels have filled the whole world. It is not
by merely being in the world, however, that we lapse from God, but by touching and tainting
ourselves with the world’s sins. I shall break with my Maker, that is, by going to the Capitol
or the temple of Serapis to sacrifice or adore, as I shall also do by going as a spectator to the
circus and the theatre. The places in themselves do not contaminate, but what is done in
them; from this even the places themselves, we maintain, become defiled. The polluted
things pollute us. It is on this account that we set before you to whom places of the kind

<pb n="167"/>
are dedicated, that we may prove the things which are done in them to belong to the idolpatrons
to whom the very places are sacred.356</p>

<head>Chapter IX.</head>
<p>Now as to the kind of performances peculiar to the circus exhibitions. In former days
equestrianism was practised in a simple way on horseback, and certainly its ordinary use
had nothing sinful in it; but when it was dragged into the games, it passed from the service
of God into the employment of demons. Accordingly this kind of circus performances is
regarded as sacred to Castor and Pollux, to whom, Stesichorus tells us, horses were given
by Mercury. And Neptune, too, is an equestrian deity, by the Greeks called Hippius. In regard
to the team, they have consecrated the chariot and four to the sun; the chariot and pair to
the moon. But, as the poet has it, “Erichthonius first dared to yoke four horses to the
chariot, and to ride upon its wheels with victorious swiftness.” Erichthonius, the son of
Vulcan and Minerva, fruit of unworthy passion upon earth, is a demon-monster, nay, the
devil himself, and no mere snake. But if Trochilus the Argive is maker of the first chariot,
he dedicated that work of his to Juno. If Romulus first exhibited the four-horse chariot at
Rome, he too, I think, has a place given him among idols, at least if he and Quirinus are the
same. But as chariots had such inventors, the charioteers were naturally dressed, too, in the
colours of idolatry; for at first these were only two, namely white and red,—the former sacred
to the winter with its glistening snows, the latter sacred to the summer with its ruddy sun:
but afterwards, in the progress of luxury as well as of superstition, red was dedicated by
some to Mars, and white by others to the Zephyrs, while green was given to Mother Earth,
or spring, and azure to the sky and sea, or autumn. But as idolatry of every kind is condemned
by God, that form of it surely shares the condemnation which is offered to the elements of
nature.</p>

<head>Chapter X.</head>
<p>Let us pass on now to theatrical exhibitions, which we have already shown have a com-
mon origin with the circus, and bear like idolatrous designations—even as from the first
they have borne the name of “Ludi,” and equally minister to idols. They resemble each
other also in their pomp, having the same procession to the scene of their display from
temples and altars, and that mournful profusion of incense and blood, with music of pipes
and trumpets, all under the direction of the soothsayer and the undertaker, those two foul
masters of funeral rites and sacrifices. So as we went on from the origin of the “Ludi” to the
circus games, we shall now direct our course thence to those of the theatre, beginning with
the place of exhibition. At first the theatre was properly a temple of Venus; and, to speak
briefly, it was owing to this that stage performances were allowed to escape censure, and
got a footing in the world. For ofttimes the censors, in the interests of morality, put down
above all the rising theatres, foreseeing, as they did, that there was great danger of their
leading to a general profligacy; so that already, from this accordance of their own people
with us, there is a witness to the heathen, and in the anticipatory judgment of human
knowledge even a confirmation of our views. Accordingly Pompey the Great, less only than
his theatre, when he had erected that citadel of all impurities, fearing some time or other
censorian condemnation of his memory, superposed on it a temple of Venus; and summoning
by public proclamation the people to its consecration, he called it not a theatre, but a temple,
“under which,” said he, “we have placed tiers of seats for viewing the shows.” So he threw
a veil over a structure on which condemnation had been often passed, and which is ever to
be held in reprobation, by pretending that it was a sacred place; and by means of superstition
he blinded the eyes of a virtuous discipline. But Venus and Bacchus are close allies. These
two evil spirits are in sworn confederacy with each other, as the patrons of drunkenness and
lust. So the theatre of Venus is as well the house of Bacchus: for they properly gave the name
of Liberalia also to other theatrical amusements—which besides being consecrated to Bacchus
(as were the Dionysia of the Greeks), were instituted by him; and, without doubt, the performances
of the theatre have the common patronage of these two deities. That immodesty
of gesture and attire which so specially and peculiarly characterizes the stage are consecrated
to them—the one deity wanton by her sex, the other by his drapery; while its services of
voice, and song, and lute, and pipe, belong to Apollos, and Muses, and Minervas, and Mercuries.
You will hate, O Christian, the things whose authors must be the objects of your utter
detestation. So we would now make a remark about the arts of the theatre, about the things
also whose authors in the names we execrate. We know that the names of the dead are
nothing, as are their images; but we know well enough, too, who, when images are set up,
under these names carry on their wicked work, and exult in the homage rendered to them,
and pretend to be divine—none other than spirits accursed, than devils. We see, therefore,
that the arts also are consecrated to the service of the beings who dwell in the names of their

<pb n="170"/>
founders; and that things cannot be held free from the taint of idolatry whose inventors
have got a place among the gods for their discoveries. Nay, as regards the arts, we ought to
have gone further back, and barred all further argument by the position that the demons,
predetermining in their own interests from the first, among other evils of idolatry, the pollutions
of the public shows, with the object of drawing man away from his Lord and binding
him to their own service, carried out their purpose by bestowing on him the artistic gifts
which the shows require. For none but themselves would have made provision and preparation
for the objects they had in view; nor would they have given the arts to the world by
any but those in whose names, and images, and histories they set up for their own ends the
artifice of consecration.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="11">
<pb n="171"/>
<head>Chapter XI.</head>
<p>In fulfilment of our plan, let us now go on to consider the combats. Their origin is akin
to that of the games (ludi). Hence they are kept as either sacred or funereal, as they have
been instituted in honour of the idol-gods of the nations or of the dead. Thus, too, they are
called Olympian in honour of Jupiter, known at Rome as the Capitoline; Nemean, in honour
of Hercules; Isthmian, in honour of Neptune; the rest mortuarii, as belonging to the dead.
What wonder, then, if idolatry pollutes the combat-parade with profane crowns, with sacerdotal
chiefs, with attendants belonging to the various colleges, last of all with the blood of
its sacrifices? To add a completing word about the “place”—in the common place for the
college of the arts sacred to the Muses, and Apollo, and Minerva, and also for that of the
arts dedicated to Mars, they with contest and sound of trumpet emulate the circus in the
arena, which is a real temple—I mean of the god whose festivals it celebrates. The gymnastic
arts also originated with their Castors, and Herculeses, and Mercuries.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="12">
<pb n="172"/>
<head>Chapter XII.</head>
<p>It remains for us to examine the “spectacle” most noted of all, and in highest favour. It
is called a dutiful service (munus), from its being an office, for it bears the name of “officium”
as well as “munus.” The ancients thought that in this solemnity they rendered offices to the
dead; at a later period, with a cruelty more refined, they somewhat modified its character.
For formerly, in the belief that the souls of the departed were appeased by human blood,
they were in the habit of buying captives or slaves of wicked disposition, and immolating
them in their funeral obsequies. Afterwards they thought good to throw the veil of pleasure
over their iniquity.357 Those, therefore, whom they had provided for the combat, and then
trained in arms as best they could, only that they might learn to die, they, on the funeral
day, killed at the places of sepulture. They alleviated death by murders. Such is the origin
of the “Munus.” But by degrees their refinement came up to their cruelty; for these human
wild beasts could not find pleasure exquisite enough, save in the spectacle of men torn to
pieces by wild beasts. Offerings to propitiate the dead then were regarded as belonging to
the class of funeral sacrifices; and these are idolatry: for idolatry, in fact, is a sort of homage
to the departed; the one as well as the other is a service to dead men. Moreover, demons
have abode in the images of the dead. To refer also to the matter of names, though this sort
of exhibition has passed from honours of the dead to honours of the living, I mean, to
quæstorships and magistracies—to priestly offices of different kinds; yet, since idolatry still
cleaves to the dignity’s name, whatever is done in its name partakes of its impurity. The
same remark will apply to the procession of the “Munus,” as we look at that in the pomp
which is connected with these honours themselves; for the purple robes, the fasces, the fillets,
the crowns, the proclamations too, and edicts, the sacred feasts of the day before, are not
without the pomp of the devil, without invitation of demons. What need, then, of dwelling
on the place of horrors, which is too much even for the tongue of the perjurer? For the amphitheatre358
is consecrated to names more numerous and more dire359 than is the Capitol
itself, temple of all demons as it is. There are as many unclean spirits there as it holds men.
To conclude with a single remark about the arts which have a place in it, we know that its
two sorts of amusement have for their patrons Mars and Diana.</p>

<p>We have, I think, faithfully carried out our plan of showing in how many different ways
the sin of idolatry clings to the shows, in respect of their origins, their titles, their equipments,
their places of celebration, their arts; and we may hold it as a thing beyond all doubt, that
for us who have twice360 renounced all idols, they are utterly unsuitable. “Not that an idol
is anything,”361 as the apostle says, but that the homage they render is to demons, who are
the real occupants of these consecrated images, whether of dead men or (as they think) of
gods. On this account, therefore, because they have a common source—for their dead and
their deities are one—we abstain from both idolatries. Nor do we dislike the temples less
than the monuments: we have nothing to do with either altar, we adore neither image; we
do not offer sacrifices to the gods, and we make no funeral oblations to the departed; nay,
we do not partake of what is offered either in the one case or the other, for we cannot partake
of God’s feast and the feast of devils.362 If, then, we keep throat and belly free from such
defilements, how much more do we withhold our nobler parts, our ears and eyes, from the
idolatrous and funereal enjoyments, which are not passed through the body, but are digested
in the very spirit and soul, whose purity, much more than that of our bodily organs, God
has a right to claim from us.</p>

<p>Having sufficiently established the charge of idolatry, which alone ought to be reason
enough for our giving up the shows, let us now ex abundanti look at the subject in another
way, for the sake of those especially who keep themselves comfortable in the thought that
the abstinence we urge is not in so many words enjoined, as if in the condemnation of the
lusts of the world there was not involved a sufficient declaration against all these amusements.
For as there is a lust of money, or rank, or eating, or impure enjoyment, or glory, so there
is also a lust of pleasure. But the show is just a sort of pleasure. I think, then, that under the
general designation of lusts, pleasures are included; in like manner, under the general idea
of pleasures, you have as a specific class the “shows.” But we have spoken already of how it
is with the places of exhibition, that they are not polluting in themselves, but owing to the
things that are done in them from which they imbibe impurity, and then spirt it again on
others.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="15">
<pb n="175"/>
<head>Chapter XV.</head>
<p>Having done enough, then, as we have said, in regard to that principal argument, that
there is in them all the taint of idolatry—having sufficiently dealt with that, let us now contrast
the other characteristics of the show with the things of God. God has enjoined us to deal
calmly, gently, quietly, and peacefully with the Holy Spirit, because these things are alone
in keeping with the goodness of His nature, with His tenderness and sensitiveness, and not
to vex Him with rage, ill-nature, anger, or grief. Well, how shall this be made to accord with
the shows? For the show always leads to spiritual agitation, since where there is pleasure,
there is keenness of feeling giving pleasure its zest; and where there is keenness of feeling,
there is rivalry giving in turn its zest to that. Then, too, where you have rivalry, you have
rage, bitterness, wrath and grief, with all bad things which flow from them—the whole entirely
out of keeping with the religion of Christ. For even suppose one should enjoy the shows in
a moderate way, as befits his rank, age or nature, still he is not undisturbed in mind, without
some unuttered movings of the inner man. No one partakes of pleasures such as these
without their strong excitements; no one comes under their excitements without their natural
lapses. These lapses, again, create passionate desire. If there is no desire, there is no
pleasure, and he is chargeable with trifling who goes where nothing is gotten; in my view,
even that is foreign to us. Moreover, a man pronounces his own condemnation in the very
act of taking his place among those with whom, by his disinclination to be like them, he
confesses he has no sympathy. It is not enough that we do no such things ourselves, unless
we break all connection also with those who do. “If thou sawest a thief,” says the Scripture,
“thou consentedst with him.”363 Would that we did not even inhabit the same world with
these wicked men! But though that wish cannot be realized, yet even now we are separate
from them in what is of the world; for the world is God’s, but the worldly is the devil’s.</p>

<p>Since, then, all passionate excitement is forbidden us, we are debarred from every kind
of spectacle, and especially from the circus, where such excitement presides as in its proper
element. See the people coming to it already under strong emotion, already tumultuous,
already passion-blind, already agitated about their bets. The prætor is too slow for them:
their eyes are ever rolling as though along with the lots in his urn; then they hang all eager
on the signal; there is the united shout of a common madness. Observe how “out of themselves”
they are by their foolish speeches. “He has thrown it!” they exclaim; and they announce
each one to his neighbour what all have seen. I have clearest evidence of their blindness;
they do not see what is really thrown. They think it a “signal cloth,” but it is the likeness of
the devil cast headlong from on high. And the result accordingly is, that they fly into rages,
and passions, and discords, and all that they who are consecrated to peace ought never to
indulge in. Then there are curses and reproaches, with no cause of hatred; there are cries of
applause, with nothing to merit them. What are the partakers in all this—not their own
masters—to obtain of it for themselves? unless, it may be, that which makes them not their
own: they are saddened by another’s sorrow, they are gladdened by another’s joy. Whatever
they desire on the one hand, or detest on the other, is entirely foreign to themselves. So love
with them is a useless thing, and hatred is unjust. Or is a causeless love perhaps more legitimate
than a causeless hatred? God certainly forbids us to hate even with a reason for our
hating; for He commands us to love our enemies. God forbids us to curse, though there be
some ground for doing so, in commanding that those who curse us we are to bless. But what
is more merciless than the circus, where people do not spare even their rulers and fellowcitizens?
If any of its madnesses are becoming elsewhere in the saints of God, they will be
seemly in the circus too; but if they are nowhere right, so neither are they there.</p>

<p>Are we not, in like manner, enjoined to put away from us all immodesty? On this
ground, again, we are excluded from the theatre, which is immodesty’s own peculiar abode,
where nothing is in repute but what elsewhere is disreputable. So the best path to the highest
favour of its god is the vileness which the Atellan364 gesticulates, which the buffoon in woman’s
clothes exhibits, destroying all natural modesty, so that they blush more readily at
home than at the play, which finally is done from his childhood on the person of the pantomime,
that he may become an actor. The very harlots, too, victims of the public lust, are
brought upon the stage, their misery increased as being there in the presence of their own
sex, from whom alone they are wont to hide themselves: they are paraded publicly before
every age and every rank—their abode, their gains, their praises, are set forth, and that even
in the hearing of those who should not hear such things. I say nothing about other matters,
which it were good to hide away in their own darkness and their own gloomy caves, lest
they should stain the light of day. Let the Senate, let all ranks, blush for very shame! Why,
even these miserable women, who by their own gestures destroy their modesty, dreading
the light of day, and the people’s gaze, know something of shame at least once a year. But
if we ought to abominate all that is immodest, on what ground is it right to hear what we
must not speak? For all licentiousness of speech, nay, every idle word, is condemned by
God. Why, in the same way, is it right to look on what it is disgraceful to do? How is it that
the things which defile a man in going out of his mouth, are not regarded as doing so when
they go in at his eyes and ears—when eyes and ears are the immediate attendants on the
spirit—and that can never be pure whose servants-in-waiting are impure? You have the
theatre forbidden, then, in the forbidding of immodesty. If, again, we despise the teaching
of secular literature as being foolishness in God’s eyes, our duty is plain enough in regard
to those spectacles, which from this source derive the tragic or comic play. If tragedies and
comedies are the bloody and wanton, the impious and licentious inventors of crimes and
lusts, it is not good even that there should be any calling to remembrance the atrocious or
the vile. What you reject in deed, you are not to bid welcome to in word.</p>

<p>OBut if you argue that the racecourse is mentioned in Scripture, I grant it at once. But
you will not refuse to admit that the things which are done there are not for you to look
upon: the blows, and kicks, and cuffs, and all the recklessness of hand, and everything like
that disfiguration of the human countenance, which is nothing less than the disfiguration
of God’s own image. You will never give your approval to those foolish racing and throwing
feats, and yet more foolish leapings; you will never find pleasure in injurious or useless exhibitions
of strength; certainly you will not regard with approval those efforts after an artificial
body which aim at surpassing the Creator’s work; and you will have the very opposite
of complacency in the athletes Greece, in the inactivity of peace, feeds up. And the wrestler’s
art is a devil’s thing. The devil wrestled with, and crushed to death, the first human beings.

<p>We shall now see how the Scriptures condemn the amphitheatre. If we can maintain
that it is right to indulge in the cruel, and the impious, and the fierce, let us go there. If we
are what we are said to be, let us regale ourselves there with human blood. It is good, no
doubt, to have the guilty punished. Who but the criminal himself will deny that? And yet
the innocent can find no pleasure in another’s sufferings: he rather mourns that a brother
has sinned so heinously as to need a punishment so dreadful. But who is my guarantee that
it is always the guilty who are adjudged to the wild beasts, or to some other doom, and that
the guiltless never suffer from the revenge of the judge, or the weakness of the defence, or
the pressure of the rack? How much better, then, is it for me to remain ignorant of the
punishment inflicted on the wicked, lest I am obliged to know also of the good coming to
untimely ends—if I may speak of goodness in the case at all! At any rate, gladiators not
chargeable with crime are offered in sale for the games, that they may become the victims
of the public pleasure. Even in the case of those who are judicially condemned to the amphitheatre,
what a monstrous thing it is, that, in undergoing their punishment, they, from some
less serious delinquency, advance to the criminality of manslayers! But I mean these remarks
for heathen. As to Christians, I shall not insult them by adding another word as to the
aversion with which they should regard this sort of exhibition; though no one is more able
than myself to set forth fully the whole subject, unless it be one who is still in the habit of
going to the shows. I would rather withal be incomplete than set memory a-working.365</p>

<p>How vain, then—nay, how desperate—is the reasoning of persons, who, just because
they decline to lose a pleasure, hold out that we cannot point to the specific words or the
very place where this abstinence is mentioned, and where the servants of God are directly
forbidden to have anything to do with such assemblies! I heard lately a novel defence of
himself by a certain play-lover. “The sun,” said he, “nay, God Himself, looks down from
heaven on the show, and no pollution is contracted.” Yes, and the sun, too, pours down his
rays into the common sewer without being defiled. As for God, would that all crimes were
hid from His eye, that we might all escape judgment! But He looks on robberies too; He
looks on falsehoods, adulteries, frauds, idolatries, and these same shows; and precisely on
that account we will not look on them, lest the All-seeing see us. You are putting on the
same level, O man, the criminal and the judge; the criminal who is a criminal because he is
seen, and the Judge who is a Judge because He sees. Are we set, then, on playing the madman
outside the circus boundaries? Outside the gates of the theatre are we bent on lewdness,
outside the course on arrogance, and outside the amphitheatre on cruelty, because outside
the porticoes, the tiers and the curtains, too, God has eyes? Never and nowhere is that free
from blame which God ever condemns; never and nowhere is it right to do what you may
not do at all times and in all places. It is the freedom of the truth from change of opinion
and varying judgments which constitutes its perfection, and gives it its claims to full mastery,
unchanging reverence, and faithful obedience. That which is really good or really evil cannot
be ought else. But in all things the truth of God is immutable.</p>

<p>The heathen, who have not a full revelation of the truth, for they are not taught of God,
hold a thing evil and good as it suits self-will and passion, making that which is good in one
place evil in another, and that which is evil in one place in another good. So it strangely
happens, that the same man who can scarcely in public lift up his tunic, even when necessity
of nature presses him, takes it off in the circus, as if bent on exposing himself before everybody;
the father who carefully protects and guards his virgin daughter’s ears from every
polluting word, takes her to the theatre himself, exposing her to all its vile words and attitudes;
he, again, who in the streets lays hands on or covers with reproaches the brawling pugilist,
in the arena gives all encouragement to combats of a much more serious kind; and he who
looks with horror on the corpse of one who has died under the common law of nature, in
the amphitheatre gazes down with most patient eyes on bodies all mangled and torn and
smeared with their own blood; nay, the very man who comes to the show, because he thinks
murderers ought to suffer for their crime, drives the unwilling gladiator to the murderous
deed with rods and scourges; and one who demands the lion for every manslayer of deeper
dye, will have the staff for the savage swordsman, and rewards him with the cap of liberty.
Yes and he must have the poor victim back again, that he may get a sight of his face—with
zest inspecting near at hand the man whom he wished torn in pieces at safe distance from
him: so much the more cruel he if that was not his wish.</p>

<p>What wonder is there in it? Such inconsistencies as these are just such as we might expect
from men, who confuse and change the nature of good and evil in their inconstancy of
feeling and fickleness in judgment. Why, the authors and managers of the spectacles, in that
very respect with reference to which they highly laud the charioteers, and actors, and
wrestlers, and those most loving gladiators, to whom men prostitute their souls, women too
their bodies, slight and trample on them, though for their sakes they are guilty of the deeds
they reprobate; nay, they doom them to ignominy and the loss of their rights as citizens,
excluding them from the Curia, and the rostra, from senatorial and equestrian rank, and
from all other honours as well as certain distinctions. What perversity! They have pleasure
in those whom yet they punish; they put all slights on those to whom, at the same time, they
award their approbation; they magnify the art and brand the artist. What an outrageous
thing it is, to blacken a man on account of the very things which make him meritorious in
their eyes! Nay, what a confession that the things are evil, when their authors, even in highest
favour, are not without a mark of disgrace upon them!</p>

<p>Seeing, then, man’s own reflections, even in spite of the sweetness of pleasure, lead him
to think that people such as these should be condemned to a hapless lot of infamy, losing
all the advantages connected with the possession of the dignities of life, how much more
does the divine righteousness inflict punishment on those who give themselves to these arts!
Will God have any pleasure in the charioteer who disquiets so many souls, rouses up so
many furious passions, and creates so many various moods, either crowned like a priest or
wearing the colours of a pimp, decked out by the devil that he may be whirled away in his
chariot, as though with the object of taking off Elijah? Will He be pleased with him who
applies the razor to himself, and completely changes his features; who, with no respect for
his face, is not content with making it as like as possible to Saturn and Isis and Bacchus, but
gives it quietly over to contumelious blows, as if in mockery of our Lord? The devil, forsooth,
makes it part, too, of his teaching, that the cheek is to be meekly offered to the smiter. In
the same way, with their high shoes, he has made the tragic actors taller, because “none can
add a cubit to his stature.”366 His desire is to make Christ a liar. And in regard to the wearing
of masks, I ask is that according to the mind of God, who forbids the making of every likeness,
and especially then the likeness of man who is His own image? The Author of truth hates
all the false; He regards as adultery all that is unreal. Condemning, therefore, as He does
hypocrisy in every form, He never will approve any putting on of voice, or sex, or age; He
never will approve pretended loves, and wraths, and groans, and tears. Then, too, as in His
law it is declared that the man is cursed who attires himself in female garments,367 what
must be His judgment of the pantomime, who is even brought up to play the woman! And
will the boxer go unpunished? I suppose he received these cæstus-scars, and the thick skin
of his fists, and these growths upon his ears, at his creation! God, too, gave him eyes for no
other end than that they might be knocked out in fighting! I say nothing of him who, to
save himself, thrusts another in the lion’s way, that he may not be too little of a murderer
when he puts to death that very same man on the arena.</p>

<p>In how many other ways shall we yet further show that nothing which is peculiar to the
shows has God’s approval, or without that approval is becoming in God’s servants? If we
have succeeded in making it plain that they were instituted entirely for the devil’s sake, and
have been got up entirely with the devil’s things (for all that is not God’s, or is not pleasing
in His eyes, belongs to His wicked rival), this simply means that in them you have that pomp
of the devil which in the “seal” of our faith we abjure. We should have no connection with
the things which we abjure, whether in deed or word, whether by looking on them or looking
forward to them; but do we not abjure and rescind that baptismal pledge, when we cease to
bear its testimony? Does it then remain for us to apply to the heathen themselves. Let them
tell us, then, whether it is right in Christians to frequent the show. Why, the rejection of
these amusements is the chief sign to them that a man has adopted the Christian faith. If
any one, then, puts away the faith’s distinctive badge, he is plainly guilty of denying it. What
hope can you possibly retain in regard to a man who does that? When you go over to the
enemy’s camp, you throw down your arms, desert the standards and the oath of allegiance
to your chief: you cast in your lot for life or death with your new friends.</p>

<p>Seated where there is nothing of God, will one be thinking of his Maker? Will there be
peace in his soul when there is eager strife there for a charioteer? Wrought up into a frenzied
excitement, will he learn to be modest? Nay, in the whole thing he will meet with no greater
temptation than that gay attiring of the men and women. The very intermingling of emotions,
the very agreements and disagreements with each other in the bestowment of their favours,
where you have such close communion, blow up the sparks of passion. And then there is
scarce any other object in going to the show, but to see and to be seen. When a tragic actor
is declaiming, will one be giving thought to prophetic appeals? Amid the measures of the
effeminate player, will he call up to himself a psalm? And when the athletes are hard at
struggle, will he be ready to proclaim that there must be no striking again? And with his eye
fixed on the bites of bears, and the sponge-nets of the net-fighters, can he be moved by
compassion? May God avert from His people any such passionate eagerness after a cruel
enjoyment! For how monstrous it is to go from God’s church to the devil’s—from the sky
to the stye,368 as they say; to raise your hands to God, and then to weary them in the applause
of an actor; out of the mouth, from which you uttered Amen over the Holy Thing, to give
witness in a gladiator’s favour; to cry “forever” to any one else but God and Christ!</p>

creature was upbraided with having dared to attack a believer, he firmly replied,370 “And
in truth I did it most righteously, for I found her in my domain.” Another case, too, is well
known, in which a woman had been hearing a tragedian, and on the very night she saw in
her sleep a linen cloth—the actor’s name being mentioned at the same time with strong
disapproval—and five days after that woman was no more. How many other undoubted
proofs we have had in the case of persons who, by keeping company with the devil in the

that there God’s name is blasphemed—that there the cry “To the lions!” is daily raised against
us373—that from thence persecuting decrees are wont to emanate, and temptations are sent
forth. What will you do if you are caught in that heaving tide of impious judgments? Not
that there any harm is likely to come to you from men: nobody knows that you are a
Christian; but think how it fares with you in heaven. For at the very time the devil is working
havoc in the church, do you doubt that the angels are looking down from above, and
marking every man, who speaks and who listens to the blaspheming word, who lends his
tongue and who lends his ears to the service of Satan against God? Shall you not then shun
those tiers where the enemies of Christ assemble, that seat of all that is pestilential, and the
very super incumbent atmosphere all impure with wicked cries? Grant that you have there
things that are pleasant, things both agreeable and innocent in themselves; even some things
that are excellent. Nobody dilutes poison with gall and hellebore: the accursed thing is put
into condiments well seasoned and of sweetest taste. So, too, the devil puts into the deadly
draught which he prepares, things of God most pleasant and most acceptable. Everything
there, then, that is either brave, noble, loud-sounding, melodious, or exquisite in taste, hold

as of the danger you run from its attractions.</p>

down in fellowship with them, as neither can they with us. Things in this matter go by their
turns. Now they have gladness and we are troubled. “The world,” says Jesus, “shall rejoice;
ye shall be sorrowful.”374 Let us mourn, then, while the heathen are merry, that in the day
of their sorrow we may rejoice; lest, sharing now in their gladness, we share then also in
their grief. Thou art too dainty, Christian, if thou wouldst have pleasure in this life as well
as in the next; nay, a fool thou art, if thou thinkest this life’s pleasures to be really pleasures.
The philosophers, for instance, give the name of pleasure to quietness and repose; in that
they have their bliss; in that they find entertainment: they even glory in it. You long for the
goal, and the stage, and the dust, and the place of combat! I would have you answer me this

under foot the gods of the nations—to exorcise evil spirits376—to perform cures—to seek

Christian men—holy, everlasting, free. Count of these as your circus games, fix your eyes

goal of the final consummation, defend the societies of the churches, be startled at God’s

of the stage delight you, we have literature in abundance of our own—plenty of verses,
sentences, songs, proverbs; and these not fabulous, but true; not tricks of art, but plain
realities. Would you have also fightings and wrestlings? Well, of these there is no lacking,
and they are not of slight account. Behold unchastity overcome by chastity, perfidy slain by
faithfulness, cruelty stricken by compassion, impudence thrown into the shade by modesty:

The Chaplet, or De Corona.380</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>Chapter I.</head>
<p>Very lately it happened thus: while the bounty of our most excellent emperors381 was
dispensed in the camp, the soldiers, laurel-crowned, were approaching. One of them, more
a soldier of God, more stedfast than the rest of his brethren, who had imagined that they
could serve two masters, his head alone uncovered, the useless crown in his hand—already
even by that peculiarity known to every one as a Christian—was nobly conspicuous. Accordingly,
all began to mark him out, jeering him at a distance, gnashing on him near at hand.
The murmur is wafted to the tribune, when the person had just left the ranks. The tribune
at once puts the question to him, Why are you so different in your attire? He declared that
he had no liberty to wear the crown with the rest. Being urgently asked for his reasons, he
answered, I am a Christian. O soldier! boasting thyself in God. Then the case was considered
and voted on; the matter was remitted to a higher tribunal; the offender was conducted to
the prefects. At once he put away the heavy cloak, his disburdening commenced; he loosed
from his foot the military shoe, beginning to stand upon holy ground;382 he gave up the
sword, which was not necessary either for the protection of our Lord; from his hand likewise
dropped the laurel crown; and now, purple-clad with the hope of his own blood, shod with
the preparation of the gospel, girt with the sharper word of God, completely equipped in
the apostles’ armour, and crowned more worthily with the white crown of martyrdom, he
awaits in prison the largess of Christ. Thereafter adverse judgments began to be passed upon
his conduct—whether on the part of Christians I do not know, for those of the heathen are
not different—as if he were headstrong and rash, and too eager to die, because, in being
taken to task about a mere matter of dress, he brought trouble on the bearers of the
Name,383—he, forsooth, alone brave among so many soldier-brethren, he alone a Christian.
<note type="footnote">380 [Kaye, apparently accepting the judgment of Dr. Neander, assigns this treatise to a.d. 204. The bounty

It is plain that as they have rejected the prophecies of the Holy Spirit,384 they are also purposing
the refusal of martyrdom. So they murmur that a peace so good and long is endangered
for them. Nor do I doubt that some are already turning their back on the Scriptures,
are making ready their luggage, are equipped for flight from city to city; for that is all of the
gospel they care to remember. I know, too, their pastors are lions in peace, deer in the fight.
As to the questions asked for extorting confessions from us, we shall teach elsewhere. Now,
as they put forth also the objection—But where are we forbidden to be crowned?—I shall
take this point up, as more suitable to be treated of here, being the essence, in fact, of the
present contention. So that, on the one hand, the inquirers who are ignorant, but anxious,
may be instructed; and on the other, those may be refuted who try to vindicate the sin, especially
the laurel-crowned Christians themselves, to whom it is merely a question of debate,
as if it might be regarded as either no trespass at all, or at least a doubtful one, because it
may be made the subject of investigation. That it is neither sinless nor doubtful, I shall now,
however, show.</p>

the Montanist notion of “New Prophecy” seems to justify the decision of critics against Gibbon, who, as Kaye

against Imperial Law.]</note>

<head>Chapter I.</head>
<p>I affirm that not one of the Faithful has ever a crown upon his head, except at a time of
trial. That is the case with all, from catechumens to confessors and martyrs,385 or (as the
case may be) deniers. Consider, then, whence the custom about which we are now chiefly
inquiring got its authority. But when the question is raised why it is observed, it is meanwhile
evident that it is observed. Therefore that can neither be regarded as no offence, or an uncertain
one, which is perpetrated against a practice which is capable of defence, on the
ground even of its repute, and is sufficiently ratified by the support of general acceptance.
It is undoubted, so that we ought to inquire into the reason of the thing; but without prejudice
to the practice, not for the purpose of overthrowing it, but rather of building it up, that you
may all the more carefully observe it, when you are also satisfied as to its reason. But what
sort of procedure is it, for one to be bringing into debate a practice, when he has fallen from
it, and to be seeking the explanation of his having ever had it, when he has left it off? Since,
although he may wish to seem on this account desirous to investigate it, that he may show
that he has not done wrong in giving it up, it is evident that he nevertheless transgressed
previously in its presumptuous observance. If he has done no wrong to-day in accepting
the crown he offended before in refusing it. This treatise, therefore, will not be for those
who not in a proper condition for inquiry, but for those who, with the real desire of getting
instruction, bring forward, not a question for debate, but a request for advice. For it is from
this desire that a true inquiry always proceeds; and I praise the faith which has believed in
the duty of complying with the rule, before it has learned the reason of it. An easy thing it
is at once to demand where it is written that we should not be crowned. But is it written
that we should be crowned? Indeed, in urgently demanding the warrant of Scripture in a
different side from their own, men prejudge that the support of Scripture ought no less to
appear on their part. For if it shall be said that it is lawful to be crowned on this ground,
that Scripture does not forbid it, it will as validly be retorted that just on this ground is the
crown unlawful, because the Scripture does not enjoin it. What shall discipline do? Shall it
accept both things, as if neither were forbidden? Or shall it refuse both, as if neither were
enjoined? But “the thing which is not forbidden is freely permitted.” I should rather say386
that what has not been freely allowed is forbidden.</p>

<head>Chapter III.</head>
<p>And how long shall we draw the saw to and fro through this line, when we have an ancient
practice, which by anticipation has made for us the state, i.e., of the question? If no
passage of Scripture has prescribed it, assuredly custom, which without doubt flowed from
tradition, has confirmed it. For how can anything come into use, if it has not first been
handed down? Even in pleading tradition, written authority, you say, must be demanded.
Let us inquire, therefore, whether tradition, unless it be written, should not be admitted.
Certainly we shall say that it ought not to be admitted, if no cases of other practices which,
without any written instrument, we maintain on the ground of tradition alone, and the
countenance thereafter of custom, affords us any precedent. To deal with this matter briefly,
I shall begin with baptism.387 When we are going to enter the water, but a little before, in
the presence of the congregation and under the hand of the president, we solemnly profess
that we disown the devil, and his pomp, and his angels. Hereupon we are thrice immersed,
making a somewhat ampler pledge than the Lord has appointed in the Gospel. Then when
we are taken up (as new-born children),388 we taste first of all a mixture of milk and honey,
and from that day we refrain from the daily bath for a whole week. We take also, in congregations
before daybreak, and from the hand of none but the presidents, the sacrament of the
Eucharist, which the Lord both commanded to be eaten at meal-times, and enjoined to be
taken by all alike.389 As often as the anniversary comes round, we make offerings for the
dead as birthday honours. We count fasting or kneeling in worship on the Lord’s day to be
unlawful. We rejoice in the same privilege also from Easter to Whitsunday. We feel pained
should any wine or bread, even though our own, be cast upon the ground. At every forward
step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when
we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary
actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign.390</p>

<p>If, for these and other such rules, you insist upon having positive Scripture injunction,
you will find none. Tradition will be held forth to you as the originator of them, custom as
their strengthener, and faith as their observer. That reason will support tradition, and custom,
and faith, you will either yourself perceive, or learn from some one who has. Meanwhile
you will believe that there is some reason to which submission is due. I add still one case
more, as it will be proper to show you how it was among the ancients also. Among the Jews,
so usual is it for their women to have the head veiled, that they may thereby be recognised.
I ask in this instance for the law. I put the apostle aside. If Rebecca at once drew down her
veil, when in the distance she saw her betrothed, this modesty of a mere private individual
could not have made a law, or it will have made it only for those who have the reason which
she had. Let virgins alone be veiled, and this when they are coming to be married, and not
till they have recognised their destined husband. If Susanna also, who was subjected to unveiling
on her trial,391 furnishes an argument for the veiling of women, I can say here also,
the veil was a voluntary thing. She had come accused, ashamed of the disgrace she had
brought on herself, properly concealing her beauty, even because now she feared to please.
But I should not suppose that, when it was her aim to please, she took walks with a veil on
in her husband’s avenue. Grant, now, that she was always veiled. In this particular case, too,
or, in fact, in that of any other, I demand the dress-law. If I nowhere find a law, it follows
that tradition has given the fashion in question to custom, to find subsequently (its authorization
in) the apostle’s sanction, from the true interpretation of reason. This instances,
therefore, will make it sufficiently plain that you can vindicate the keeping of even unwritten
tradition established by custom; the proper witness for tradition when demonstrated by
long-continued observance.392 But even in civil matters custom is accepted as law, when
positive legal enactment is wanting; and it is the same thing whether it depends on writing
or on reason, since reason is, in fact, the basis of law. But, (you say), if reason is the ground
of law, all will now henceforth have to be counted law, whoever brings it forward, which
shall have reason as its ground.393 Or do you think that every believer is entitled to originate
and establish a law, if only it be such as is agreeable to God, as is helpful to discipline, as
promotes salvation, when the Lord says, “But why do you not even of your own selves judge
what is right?”394 And not merely in regard to a judicial sentence, but in regard to every

decision in matters we are called on to consider, the apostle also says, “If of anything you
are ignorant, God shall reveal it unto you;”395 he himself, too, being accustomed to afford
counsel though he had not the command of the Lord, and to dictate of himself396 as possessing
the Spirit of God who guides into all truth. Therefore his advice has, by the warrant of
divine reason, become equivalent to nothing less than a divine command. Earnestly now
inquire of this teacher,397 keeping intact your regard for tradition, from whomsoever it
originally sprang; nor have regard to the author, but to the authority, and especially that of
custom itself, which on this very account we should revere, that we may not want an interpreter;
so that if reason too is God’s gift, you may then learn, not whether custom has to be
followed by you, but why.</p>

<head>Chapter V.</head>
<p>The argument for Christian practices becomes all the stronger, when also nature, which
is the first rule of all, supports them. Well, she is the first who lays it down that a crown does
not become the head. But I think ours is the God of nature, who fashioned man; and, that
he might desire, (appreciate, become partaker of) the pleasures afforded by His creatures,
endowed him with certain senses, (acting) through members, which, so to speak, are their
peculiar instruments. The sense of hearing he has planted in the ears; that of sight, lighted
up in the eyes; that of taste, shut up in the mouth; that of smell, wafted into the nose; that
of touch, fixed in the tips of the fingers. By means of these organs of the outer man doing
duty to the inner man, the enjoyments of the divine gifts are conveyed by the senses to the
soul.398 What, then, in flowers affords you enjoyment? For it is the flowers of the field which
are the peculiar, at least the chief, material of crowns. Either smell, you say, or colour, or
both together. What will be the senses of colour and smell? Those of seeing and smelling, I
suppose. What members have had these senses allotted to them? The eyes and the nose, if
I am not mistaken. With sight and smell, then, make use of flowers, for these are the senses
by which they are meant to be enjoyed; use them by means of the eyes and nose, which are
the members to which these senses belong. You have got the thing from God, the mode of
it from the world; but an extraordinary mode does not prevent the use of the thing in the
common way. Let flowers, then, both when fastened into each other and tied together in
thread and rush, be what they are when free, when loose—things to be looked at and smelt.
You count it a crown, let us say, when you have a bunch of them bound together in a series,
that you may carry many at one time that you may enjoy them all at once. Well, lay them
in your bosom if they are so singularly pure, and strew them on your couch if they are so
exquisitely soft, and consign them to your cup if they are so perfectly harmless. Have the
pleasure of them in as many ways as they appeal to your senses. But what taste for a flower,
what sense for anything belonging to a crown but its band, have you in the head, which is
able neither to distinguish colour, nor to inhale sweet perfumes, nor to appreciate softness?
It is as much against nature to long after a flower with the head, as it is to crave food with
the ear, or sound with the nostril. But everything which is against nature deserves to be
branded as monstrous among all men; but with us it is to be condemned also as sacrilege
against God, the Lord and Creator of nature.</p>

<p>Demanding then a law of God, you have that common one prevailing all over the world,
engraven on the natural tables to which the apostle too is wont to appeal, as when in respect
of the woman’s veil he says, “Does not even Nature teach you?”399—as when to the Romans,
affirming that the heathen do by nature those things which the law requires,400 he suggests
both natural law and a law-revealing nature. Yes, and also in the first chapter of the epistle
he authenticates nature, when he asserts that males and females changed among themselves
the natural use of the creature into that which is unnatural,401 by way of penal retribution
for their error. We first of all indeed know God Himself by the teaching of Nature, calling
Him God of gods, taking for granted that He is good, and invoking Him as Judge. Is it a
question with you whether for the enjoyment of His creatures, Nature should be our guide,
that we may not be carried away in the direction in which the rival of God has corrupted,
along with man himself, the entire creation which had been made over to our race for certain
uses, whence the apostle says that it too unwillingly became subject to vanity, completely
bereft of its original character, first by vain, then by base, unrighteous, and ungodly uses?
It is thus, accordingly, in the pleasures of the shows, that the creature is dishonoured by
those who by nature indeed perceive that all the materials of which shows are got up belong
to God, but lack the knowledge to perceive as well that they have all been changed by the
devil. But with this topic we have, for the sake of our own play-lovers, sufficiently dealt, and
that, too, in a work in Greek.402</p>

<p>Let these dealers in crowns then recognize in the meantime the authority of Nature, on
the ground of a common sense as human beings, and the certifications of their peculiar religion,
as, according to the last chapter, worshippers of the God of nature; and, as it were,
thus over and above what is required, let them consider those other reasons too which forbid
us wearing crowns, especially on the head, and indeed crowns of every sort. For we are obliged
to turn from the rule of Nature, which we share with mankind in general, that we may
maintain the whole peculiarity of our Christian discipline, in relation also to other kinds of
crowns which seem to have been provided for different uses, as being composed of different
substances, lest, because they do not consist of flowers, the use of which nature has indicated
(as it does in the case of this military laurel one itself), they may be thought not to come
under the prohibition of our sect, since they have escaped any objections of nature. I see,
then, that we must go into the matter both with more research, and more fully, from its
beginnings on through its successive stages of growth to its more erratic developments. For
this we need to turn to heathen literature, for things belonging to the heathen must be proved
from their own documents. The little of this I have acquired, will, I believe, be enough. If
there really was a Pandora, whom Hesiod mentions as the first of women, hers was the first
head the graces crowned, for she received gifts from all the gods whence she got her name
Pandora. But Moses, a prophet, not a poet-shepherd, shows us the first woman Eve having
her loins more naturally girt about with leaves than her temples with flowers. Pandora,
then, is a myth. And so we have to blush for the origin of the crown, even on the ground of
the falsehood connected with it; and, as will soon appear, on the ground no less of its realities.
For it is an undoubted fact that certain persons either originated the thing, or shed lustre
on it. Pherecydes relates that Saturn was the first who wore a crown; Diodorus, that Jupiter,
after conquering the Titans, was honoured with this gift by the rest of the gods. To Priapus
also the same author assigns fillets; and to Ariadne a garland of gold and of Indian gems,
the gift of Vulcan, afterwards of Bacchus, and subsequently turned into a constellation.
Callimachus has put a vine crown upon Juno. So too at Argos, her statue, vine-wreathed,
with a lion’s skin placed beneath her feet, exhibits the stepmother exulting over the spoils
of her two step-sons. Hercules displays upon his head sometimes poplar, sometimes wildolive,
sometimes parsley. You have the tragedy of Cerberus; you have Pindar; and besides
Callimachus, who mentions that Apollo, too when he had killed the Delphic serpent, as a
suppliant, put on a laurel garland; for among the ancients suppliants were wont to be
crowned. Harpocration argues that Bacchus the same as Osiris among the Egyptians, was
designedly crowned with ivy, because it is the nature of ivy to protect the brain against
drowsiness. But that in another way also Bacchus was the originator of the laurel crown (the
crown) in which he celebrated his triumph over the Indians, even the rabble acknowledge,
when they call the days dedicated to him the “great crown.” If you open, again, the writings

<pb n="201"/>
of the Egyptian Leo, you learn that Isis was the first who discovered and wore ears of corn
upon her head—a thing more suited to the belly. Those who want additional information
will find an ample exposition of the subject in Claudius Saturninus, a writer of distinguished
talent who treats this question also, for he has a book on crowns, so explaining their beginnings
as well as causes, and kinds, and rites, that you find all that is charming in the flower,
all that is beautiful in the leafy branch, and every sod or vine-shoot has been dedicated to
some head or other; making it abundantly clear how foreign to us we should judge the custom
of the crowned head, introduced as it was by, and thereafter constantly managed for the
honour of, those whom the world has believed to be gods. If the devil, a liar from the beginning,
is even in this matter working for his false system of godhead (idolatry), he had himself
also without doubt provided for his god-lie being carried out. What sort of thing, then, must
that be counted among the people of the true God, which was brought in by the nations in
honour of the devil’s candidates, and was set apart from the beginning to no other than
these; and which even then received its consecration to idolatry by idols and in idols yet
alive? Not as if an idol were anything, but since the things which others offer up to idols
belong to demons. But if the things which others offer to them belong to demons how much
more what idols offered to themselves, when they were in life! The demons themselves,
doubtless, had made provision for themselves by means of those whom they had possessed,
while in a state of desire and craving, before provision had been actually made.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.</head>
<p>Hold fast in the meantime this persuasion, while I examine a question which comes in
our way. For I already hear it is said, that many other things as well as crowns have been
invented by those whom the world believes to be gods, and that they are notwithstanding
to be met with both in our present usages and in those of early saints, and in the service of
God, and in Christ Himself, who did His work as man by no other than these ordinary instrumentalities
of human life. Well, let it be so; nor shall I inquire any further back into the
origin of this things. Let Mercury have been the first who taught the knowledge of letters;
I will own that they are requisite both for the business and commerce of life, and for performing
our devotion to God. Nay, if he also first strung the chord to give forth melody, I
will not deny, when listening to David, that this invention has been in use with the saints,
and has ministered to God. Let Æsculapius have been the first who sought and discovered
cures: Esaias403 mentions that he ordered Hezekiah medicine when he was sick. Paul, too,
knows that a little wine does the stomach good.404 Let Minerva have been the first who built
a ship: I shall see Jonah and the apostles sailing. Nay, there is more than this: for even Christ,
we shall find, has ordinary raiment; Paul, too, has his cloak.405 If at once, of every article of
furniture and each household vessel, you name some god of the world as the originator,
well, I must recognise Christ, both as He reclines on a couch, and when He presents a basin
for the feet of His disciples, and when He pours water into it from a ewer, and when He is
girt about with a linen towel406—a garment specially sacred to Osiris. It is thus in general
I reply upon the point, admitting indeed that we use along with others these articles, but
challenging that this be judged in the light of the distinction between things agreeable and
things opposed to reason, because the promiscuous employment of them is deceptive,
concealing the corruption of the creature, by which it has been made subject to vanity. For
we affirm that those things only are proper to be used, whether by ourselves or by those
who lived before us, and alone befit the service of God and Christ Himself, which to meet
the necessities of human life supply what is simply; useful and affords real assistance and
honourable comfort, so that they may be well believed to have come from God’s own inspiration,
who first of all no doubt provided for and taught and ministered to the enjoyment, I
should suppose, of His own man. As for the things which are out of this class, they are not
fit to be used among us, especially those which on that account indeed are not to be found
either with the world, or in the ways of Christ.</p>

<p>In short, what patriarch, what prophet, what Levite, or priest, or ruler, or at a later
period what apostle, or preacher of the gospel, or bishop, do you ever find the wearer of a
crown?407 I think not even the temple of God itself was crowned; as neither was the ark of
the testament, nor the tabernacle of witness, nor the altar, nor the candlestick crowned
though certainly, both on that first solemnity of the dedication, and in that second rejoicing
for the restoration, crowning would have been most suitable if it were worthy of God. But
if these things were figures of us (for we are temples of God, and altars, and lights, and sacred
vessels), this too they in figure set forth, that the people of God ought not to be crowned.
The reality must always correspond with the image. If, perhaps, you object that Christ
Himself was crowned, to that you will get the brief reply: Be you too crowned, as He was;
you have full permission. Yet even that crown of insolent ungodliness was not of any decree
of the Jewish people. It was a device of the Roman soldiers, taken from the practice of the
world,—a practice which the people of God never allowed either on the occasion of public
rejoicing or to gratify innate luxury: so they returned from the Babylonish captivity with
timbrels, and flutes, and psalteries, more suitably than with crowns; and after eating and
drinking, uncrowned, they rose up to play. Neither would the account of the rejoicing nor
the exposure of the luxury have been silent touching the honour or dishonour of the crown.
Thus too Isaiah, as he says, “With timbrels, and psalteries, and flutes they drink wine,”408

<head>Chapter X.</head>
<p>So, when you allege that the ornaments of the heathen deities are found no less with
God, with the object of claiming among these for general use the head-crown, you already
lay it down for yourself, that we must not have among us, as a thing whose use we are to
share with others, what is not to be found in the service of God. Well, what is so unworthy
of God indeed as that which is worthy of an idol? But what is so worthy of an idol as that
which is also worthy of a dead man? For it is the privilege of the dead also to be thus crowned,
as they too straightway become idols, both by their dress and the service of deification,
which (deification) is with us a second idolatry. Wanting, then, the sense, it will be theirs
to use the thing for which the sense is wanting, just as if in full possession of the sense they
wished to abuse it. When there ceases to be any reality in the use, there is no distinction
between using and abusing. Who can abuse a thing, when the precipient nature with which
he wishes to carry out his purpose is not his to use it? The apostle, moreover, forbids us to
abuse, while he would more naturally have taught us not to use, unless on the ground that,
where there is no sense for things, there is no wrong use of them. But the whole affair is
meaningless, and is, in fact, a dead work so far as concerns the idols; though, without doubt,
a living one as respects the demons409 to whom the religious rite belongs. “The idols of the
heathen,” says David, “are silver and gold.” “They have eyes, and see not; a nose, and smell
not; hands, and they will not handle.”410 By means of these organs, indeed, we are to enjoy
flowers; but if he declares that those who make idols will be like them, they already are so
who use anything after the style of idol adornings. “To the pure all things are pure: so, likewise,
all things to the impure are impure;”411 but nothing is more impure than idols. The
substances are themselves as creatures of God without impurity, and in this their native
state are free to the use of all; but the ministries to which in their use they are devoted, makes
all the difference; for I, too, kill a cock for myself, just as Socrates did for Æsculapius; and
if the smell of some place or other offends me, I burn the Arabian product myself, but not
with the same ceremony, nor in the same dress, nor with the same pomp, with which it is
done to idols.412 If the creature is defiled by a mere word, as the apostle teaches, “But if any
one say, This is offered in sacrifice to idols, you must not touch it,”413 much more when it
is polluted by the dress, and rites, and pomp of what is offered to the gods. Thus the crown

<pb n="205"/>
also is made out to be an offering to idols;414 for with this ceremony, and dress, and pomp,
it is presented in sacrifice to idols, its originators, to whom its use is specially given over,
and chiefly on this account, that what has no place among the things of God may not be
admitted into use with us as with others. Wherefore the apostle exclaims, “Flee idolatry:”415
certainly idolatry whole and entire he means. Reflect on what a thicket it is, and how many
thorns lie hid in it. Nothing must be given to an idol, and so nothing must be taken from
one. If it is inconsistent with faith to recline in an idol temple, what is it to appear in an idol
dress? What communion have Christ and Belial? Therefore flee from it; for he enjoins us
to keep at a distance from idolatry—to have no close dealings with it of any kind. Even an
earthly serpent sucks in men at some distance with its breath. Going still further, John says,
“My little children, keep yourselves from idols,”416—not now from idolatry, as if from the
service of it, but from idols—that is, from any resemblance to them: for it is an unworthy
thing that you, the image of the living God, should become the likeness of an idol and a
dead man. Thus far we assert, that this attire belongs to idols, both from the history of its
origin, and from its use by false religion; on this ground, besides, that while it is not mentioned
as connected with the worship of God, it is more and more given over to those in
whose antiquities, as well as festivals and services, it is found. In a word, the very doors, the
very victims and altars, the very servants and priests, are crowned. You have, in Claudius,
the crowns of all the various colleges of priests. We have added also that distinction between
things altogether different from each other—things, namely, agreeable, and things contrary
to reason—in answer to those who, because there happens to be the use of some things in
common, maintain the right of participation in all things. With reference to this part of the
subject, therefore, it now remains that the special grounds for wearing crowns should be
examined, that while we show these to be foreign, nay, even opposed to our Christian discipline,
we may demonstrate that none of them have any plea of reason to support it, on
the basis of which this article of dress might be vindicated as one in whose use we can participate,
as even some others may whose instances are cast up to us.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.</head>
<p>To begin with the real ground of the military crown, I think we must first inquire
whether warfare is proper at all for Christians. What sense is there in discussing the merely
accidental, when that on which it rests is to be condemned? Do we believe it lawful for a
human oath417 to be superadded to one divine, for a man to come under promise to another
master after Christ, and to abjure father, mother, and all nearest kinsfolk, whom even the
law has commanded us to honour and love next to God Himself, to whom the gospel, too,
holding them only of less account than Christ, has in like manner rendered honour? Shall
it be held lawful to make an occupation of the sword, when the Lord proclaims that he who
uses the sword shall perish by the sword? And shall the son of peace take part in the battle
when it does not become him even to sue at law? And shall he apply the chain, and the
prison, and the torture, and the punishment, who is not the avenger even of his own wrongs?
Shall he, forsooth, either keep watch-service for others more than for Christ, or shall he do
it on the Lord’s day, when he does not even do it for Christ Himself? And shall he keep
guard before the temples which he has renounced? And shall he take a meal where the
apostle has forbidden him?418 And shall he diligently protect by night those whom in the
day-time he has put to flight by his exorcisms, leaning and resting on the spear the while
with which Christ’s side was pierced? Shall he carry a flag,419 too, hostile to Christ? And
shall he ask a watchword from the emperor who has already received one from God? Shall
he be disturbed in death by the trumpet of the trumpeter, who expects to be aroused by the
angel’s trump? And shall the Christian be burned according to camp rule, when he was not
permitted to burn incense to an idol, when to him Christ remitted the punishment of fire?
Then how many other offences there are involved in the performances of camp offices,
which we must hold to involve a transgression of God’s law, you may see by a slight survey.
The very carrying of the name over from the camp of light to the camp of darkness is a violation
of it. Of course, if faith comes later, and finds any preoccupied with military service,
their case is different, as in the instance of those whom John used to receive for baptism,
and of those most faithful centurions, I mean the centurion whom Christ approves, and the
centurion whom Peter instructs; yet, at the same time, when a man has become a believer,
and faith has been sealed, there must be either an immediate abandonment of it, which has
been the course with many; or all sorts of quibbling will have to be resorted to in order to
avoid offending God, and that is not allowed even outside of military service;420 or, last of

<pb n="207"/>
all, for God the fate must be endured which a citizen-faith has been no less ready to accept.
Neither does military service hold out escape from punishment of sins, or exemption from
martyrdom. Nowhere does the Christian change his character. There is one gospel, and the
same Jesus, who will one day deny every one who denies, and acknowledge every one who
acknowledges God,—who will save, too, the life which has been lost for His sake; but, on
the other hand, destroy that which for gain has been saved to His dishonour. With Him the
faithful citizen is a soldier, just as the faithful soldier is a citizen.421 A state of faith admits
no plea of necessity; they are under no necessity to sin, whose one necessity is, that they do
not sin. For if one is pressed to the offering of sacrifice and the sheer denial of Christ by the
necessity of torture or of punishment, yet discipline does not connive even at that necessity;
because there is a higher necessity to dread denying and to undergo martyrdom, than to
escape from suffering, and to render the homage required. In fact, an excuse of this sort
overturns the entire essence of our sacrament, removing even the obstacle to voluntary sins;
for it will be possible also to maintain that inclination is a necessity, as involving in it, forsooth,
a sort of compulsion. I have, in fact, disposed of this very allegation of necessity with
reference to the pleas by which crowns connected with official position are vindicated, in
support of which it is in common use, since for this very reason offices must be either refused,
that we may not fall into acts of sin, or martyrdoms endured that we may get quit of offices.
Touching this primary aspect of the question, as to the unlawfulness even of a military life
itself, I shall not add more, that the secondary question may be restored to its place. Indeed,
if, putting my strength to the question, I banish from us the military life, I should now to
no purpose issue a challenge on the matter of the military crown. Suppose, then, that the
military service is lawful, as far as the plea for the crown is concerned.422</p>
<note type="footnote">as one of the methods by which a soldier who has become a Christian may continue faithful to Jesus. But the
words extra militiam are a genuine part of the text. There is no good ground, therefore, for the statement of

it had been generally known, was not very proper to conciliate the favour of the emperors toward the Christian

<p>But I first say a word also about the crown itself. This laurel one is sacred to Apollo or
Bacchus—to the former as the god of archery, to the latter as the god of triumphs. In like
manner Claudius teaches; when he tells us that soldiers are wont too to be wreathed in
myrtle. For the myrtle belongs to Venus, the mother of the Æneadæ, the mistress also of
the god of war, who, through Ilia and the Romuli is Roman. But I do not believe that Venus
is Roman as well as Mars, because of the vexation the concubine gave her.423 When military
service again is crowned with olive, the idolatry has respect to Minerva, who is equally the
goddess of arms—but got a crown of the tree referred to, because of the peace she made
with Neptune. In these respects, the superstition of the military garland will be everywhere
defiled and all-defiling. And it is further defiled, I should think, also in the grounds of it. Lo
the yearly public pronouncing of vows, what does that bear on its face to be? It takes place
first in the part of the camp where the general’s tent is, and then in the temples. In addition
to the places, observe the words also: “We vow that you, O Jupiter, will then have an ox
with gold-decorated horns.” What does the utterance mean? Without a doubt the denial
(of Christ). Albeit the Christian says nothing in these places with the mouth, he makes his
response by having the crown on his head. The laurel is likewise commanded (to be used)
at the distribution of the largess. So you see idolatry is not without its gain, selling, as it does,
Christ for pieces of gold, as Judas did for pieces of silver. Will it be “Ye cannot serve God
and mammon”424 to devote your energies to mammon, and to depart from God? Will it be
“Render unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar’s, and unto God the things which are
God’s,”425 not only not to render the human being to God, but even to take the denarius
from Cæsar? Is the laurel of the triumph made of leaves, or of corpses? Is it adorned with
ribbons, or with tombs? Is it bedewed with ointments, or with the tears of wives and mothers?
It may be of some Christians too;426 for Christ is also among the barbarians.427 Has not he
who has carried (a crown for) this cause on his head, fought even against himself? Another
son of service belongs to the royal guards. And indeed crowns are called (Castrenses), as
belonging to the camp; Munificæ likewise, from the Cæsarean functions they perform. But
even then you are still the soldier and the servant of another; and if of two masters, of God
and Cæsar: but assuredly then not of Cæsar, when you owe yourself to God, as having
higher claims, I should think, even in matters in which both have an interest.</p>

<p>For state reasons, the various orders of the citizens also are crowned with laurel crowns;
but the magistrates besides with golden ones, as at Athens, and at Rome. Even to those are
preferred the Etruscan. This appellation is given to the crowns which, distinguished by their
gems and oak leaves of gold, they put on, with mantles having an embroidery of palm
branches, to conduct the chariots containing the images of the gods to the circus. There are
also provincial crowns of gold, needing now the larger heads of images instead of those of
men. But your orders, and your magistracies, and your very place of meeting, the church,
are Christ’s. You belong to Him, for you have been enrolled in the books of life.428 There
the blood of the Lord serves for your purple robe, and your broad stripe is His own cross;
there the axe is already laid to the trunk of the tree;429 there is the branch out of the root of
Jesse.430 Never mind the state horses with their crown. Your Lord, when, according to the
Scripture, He would enter Jerusalem in triumph, had not even an ass of His own. These (put
their trust) in chariots, and these in horses; but we will seek our help in the name of the
Lord our God.431 From so much as a dwelling in that Babylon of John’s Revelation432 we
are called away; much more then from its pomp. The rabble, too, are crowned, at one time
because of some great rejoicing for the success of the emperors; at another, on account of
some custom belonging to municipal festivals. For luxury strives to make her own every
occasion of public gladness. But as for you, you are a foreigner in this world, a citizen of
Jerusalem, the city above. Our citizenship, the apostle says, is in heaven.433 You have your
own registers, your own calendar; you have nothing to do with the joys of the world; nay,
you are called to the very opposite, for “the world shall rejoice, but ye shall mourn.”434 And
I think the Lord affirms, that those who mourn are happy, not those who are crowned.
Marriage, too, decks the bridegroom with its crown; and therefore we will not have heathen
brides, lest they seduce us even to the idolatry with which among them marriage is initiated.
You have the law from the patriarchs indeed; you have the apostle enjoining people to marry
in the Lord.435 You have a crowning also on the making of a freeman; but you have been
already ransomed by Christ, and that at a great price. How shall the world manumit the
servant of another? Though it seems to be liberty, yet it will come to be found bondage. In

the world everything is nominal, and nothing real. For even then, as ransomed by Christ,
you were under no bondage to man; and now, though man has given you liberty, you are
the servant of Christ. If you think freedom of the world to be real, so that you even seal it
with a crown, you have returned to the slavery of man, imagining it to be freedom; you have
lost the freedom of Christ, fancying it is slavery. Will there be any dispute as to the cause of
crown-wearing, which contests in the games in their turn supply, and which, both as sacred
to the gods and in honour of the dead, their own reason at once condemns? It only remains,
that the Olympian Jupiter, and the Nemean Hercules, and the wretched little Archemorus,
and the hapless Antinous, should be crowned in a Christian, that he himself may become
a spectacle disgusting to behold. We have recounted, as I think, all the various causes of the
wearing of the crown, and there is not one which has any place with us: all are foreign to
us, unholy, unlawful, having been abjured already once for all in the solemn declaration of
the sacrament. For they were of the pomp of the devil and his angels, offices of the world,436
honours, festivals, popularity huntings, false vows, exhibitions of human servility, empty
praises, base glories, and in them all idolatry, even in respect of the origin of the crowns
alone, with which they are all wreathed. Claudius will tell us in his preface, indeed, that in
the poems of Homer the heaven also is crowned with constellations, and that no doubt by
God, no doubt for man; therefore man himself, too, should be crowned by God. But the
world crowns brothels, and baths, and bakehouses, and prisons, and schools, and the very
amphitheatres, and the chambers where the clothes are stripped from dead gladiators, and
the very biers of the dead. How sacred and holy, how venerable and pure is this article of
dress, determine not from the heaven of poetry alone, but from the traffickings of the whole
world. But indeed a Christian will not even dishonour his own gate with laurel crowns, if
so be he knows how many gods the devil has attached to doors; Janus so-called from gate,
Limentinus from threshold, Forcus and Carna from leaves and hinges; among the Greeks,
too, the Thyræan Apollo, and the evil spirits, the Antelii.</p>

<p>Much less may the Christian put the service of idolatry on his own head—nay, I might
have said, upon Christ, since Christ is the Head of the Christian man—(for his head) is as
free as even Christ is, under no obligation to wear a covering, not to say a band. But even
the head which is bound to have the veil, I mean woman’s, as already taken possession of
by this very thing, is not open also to a band. She has the burden of her own humility to
bear. If she ought not to appear with her head uncovered on account of the angels,437 much
more with a crown on it will she offend those (elders) who perhaps are then wearing crowns
above.438 For what is a crown on the head of a woman, but beauty made seductive, but mark
of utter wantonness,—a notable casting away of modesty, a setting temptation on fire?
Therefore a woman, taking counsel from the apostles’ foresight,439 will not too elaborately
adorn herself, that she may not either be crowned with any exquisite arrangement of her
hair. What sort of garland, however, I pray you, did He who is the Head of the man and
the glory of the woman, Christ Jesus, the Husband of the church, submit to in behalf of both
sexes? Of thorns, I think, and thistles,—a figure of the sins which the soil of the flesh brought
forth for us, but which the power of the cross removed, blunting, in its endurance by the
head of our Lord, death’s every sting. Yes, and besides the figure, there is contumely with
ready lip, and dishonour, and infamy, and the ferocity involved in the cruel things which
then disfigured and lacerated the temples of the Lord, that you may now be crowned with
laurel, and myrtle, and olive, and any famous branch, and which is of more use, with hundred-
leaved roses too, culled from the garden of Midas, and with both kinds of lily, and with
violets of all sorts, perhaps also with gems and gold, so as even to rival that crown of Christ
which He afterwards obtained. For it was after the gall He tasted the honeycomb440 and He
was not greeted as King of Glory in heavenly places till He had been condemned to the cross
as King of the Jews, having first been made by the Father for a time a little less than the angels,
and so crowned with glory and honour. If for these things, you owe your own head to Him,
repay it if you can, such as He presented His for yours; or be not crowned with flowers at
all, if you cannot be with thorns, because you may not be with flowers.</p>

<p>Keep for God His own property untainted; He will crown it if He choose. Nay, then,
He does even choose. He calls us to it. To him who conquers He says, “I will give a crown
of life.”441 Be you, too, faithful unto death, and fight you, too, the good fight, whose crown
the apostle442 feels so justly confident has been laid up for him. The angel443 also, as he goes
forth on a white horse, conquering and to conquer, receives a crown of victory; and another444
is adorned with an encircling rainbow (as it were in its fair colours)—a celestial
meadow. In like manner, the elders sit crowned around, crowned too with a crown of gold,
and the Son of Man Himself flashes out above the clouds. If such are the appearances in the
vision of the seer, of what sort will be the realities in the actual manifestation? Look at those
crowns. Inhale those odours. Why condemn you to a little chaplet, or a twisted headband,
the brow which has been destined for a diadem? For Christ Jesus has made us even kings
to God and His Father. What have you in common with the flower which is to die? You
have a flower in the Branch of Jesse, upon which the grace of the Divine Spirit in all its fulness
rested—a flower undefiled, unfading, everlasting, by choosing which the good soldier, too,
has got promotion in the heavenly ranks. Blush, ye fellow-soldiers of his, henceforth not
to be condemned even by him, but by some soldier of Mithras, who, at his initiation in the
gloomy cavern, in the camp, it may well be said, of darkness, when at the sword’s point a
crown is presented to him, as though in mimicry of martyrdom, and thereupon put upon
his head, is admonished to resist and cast it off, and, if you like, transfer it to his shoulder,
saying that Mithras is his crown. And thenceforth he is never crowned; and he has that for
a mark to show who he is, if anywhere he be subjected to trial in respect of his religion; and
he is at once believed to be a soldier of Mithras if he throws the crown away—if he say that
in his god he has his crown. Let us take note of the devices of the devil, who is wont to ape
some of God’s things with no other design than, by the faithfulness of his servants, to put
us to shame, and to condemn us.</p>

(Usages, p. 94.)</p>
<p>Here a reference to Bunsen’s Hippolytus, vol. III., so often referred to in the former
volume, will be useful. A slight metaphrase will bring out the sense, perhaps, of this most
interesting portrait of early Christian usages.</p>
<p>In baptism, we use trine immersion, in honour of the trinal Name, after renouncing the
devil and his angels and the pomps and vanities of his kingdom.445 But this trinal rite is a
ceremonial amplification of what is actually commanded. It was heretofore tolerated in
some places that communicants should take each one his portion, with his own hand, but
now we suffer none to receive this sacrament except at the hand of the minister. By our
Lord’s own precept and example, it may be received at the hour of ordinary meals, and alike
by all the faithful whether men or women, yet we usually do this in our gatherings before
daybreak. Offerings are made in honour of our departed friends, on the anniversaries of
their deaths, which we esteem their true birthdays, as they are born to a better life. We kneel
at other times, but on the Lord’s day, and from the Paschal Feast to Pentecost we stand in
prayer, nor do we count it lawful to fast on Sundays. We are concerned if even a particle of
the wine or bread, made ours, in the Lord’s Supper, falls to the ground, by our carelessness.
In all the ordinary occasions of life we furrow our foreheads with the sign of the Cross, in
which we glory none the less because it is regarded as our shame by the heathen in presence
of whom it is a profession of our faith.</p>
<p>He owns there is no Scripture for any of these usages, in which there was an amplifying
of the precepts of Christ. Let us note there was yet no superstitious usage even of this sign
of the Cross. It was an act by which, in suffering “shame for Jesus’ name,” they fortified
themselves against betraying the Master. It took the place, be it remembered, of innumerable
heathen practices, and was a protest against them. It meant—“God forbid that I should
glory, save in the Cross.” I express no personal opinion as to this observance, but give the
explanation which the early Christians would have given. Tertullian touched with
Montanism, but not yet withdrawn from Catholic Communion, pleads the common cause
of believers.</p>

(Traditions, cap. iv., p. 95.)</p>
<p>The traditions here argued for respect things in their nature indifferent. And as our
author asserts the long continuance of such usages to be their chief justification, it is evident
that he supposed them common from the Sub-apostolic age. There is nothing here to justify
amplifications and traditions which, subsequently, came in like a flood to change principles
of the Faith once delivered to the Saints. Even in his little plea for Montanistic revelations
of some possible novelties, he pre-supposes that reason must be subject to Scripture and
Apostolic Law. In a word, his own principle of “Prescription” must be honoured even in
things indifferent; if novel they are not Catholic.</p>

<head>Chapter I.</head>
<p>We are not in any great perturbation or alarm about the persecutions we suffer from
the ignorance of men; for we have attached ourselves to this sect, fully accepting the terms
of its covenant, so that, as men whose very lives are not their own, we engage in these conflicts,
our desire being to obtain God’s promised rewards, and our dread lest the woes with
which He threatens an unchristian life should overtake us. Hence we shrink not from the
grapple with your utmost rage, coming even forth of our own accord to the contest; and
condemnation gives us more pleasure than acquittal. We have sent, therefore, this tract to
you in no alarm about ourselves, but in much concern for you and for all our enemies, to
say nothing of our friends. For our religion commands us to love even our enemies, and to
pray for those who persecute us, aiming at a perfection all its own, and seeking in its disciples
something of a higher type than the commonplace goodness of the world. For all love those
who love them; it is peculiar to Christians alone to love those that hate them. Therefore
mourning over your ignorance, and compassionating human error, and looking on to that
future of which every day shows threatening signs, necessity is laid on us to come forth in
this way also, that we may set before you the truths you will not listen to openly.</p>

<head>Chapter II.</head>
<p>We are worshippers of one God, of whose existence and character Nature teaches all
men; at whose lightnings and thunders you tremble, whose benefits minister to your happiness.
You think that others, too, are gods, whom we know to be devils. However, it is a
fundamental human right, a privilege of nature, that every man should worship according
to his own convictions: one man’s religion neither harms nor helps another man. It is assuredly
no part of religion to compel religion—to which free-will and not force should lead
us—the sacrificial victims even being required of a willing mind. You will render no real
service to your gods by compelling us to sacrifice. For they can have no desire of offerings
from the unwilling, unless they are animated by a spirit of contention, which is a thing altogether
undivine. Accordingly the true God bestows His blessings alike on wicked men and
on His own elect; upon which account He has appointed an eternal judgment, when both
thankful and unthankful will have to stand before His bar. Yet you have never detected
us—sacrilegious wretches though you reckon us to be—in any theft, far less in any sacrilege.
But the robbers of your temples, all of them swear by your gods, and worship them; they
are not Christians, and yet it is they who are found guilty of sacrilegious deeds. We have
not time to unfold in how many other ways your gods are mocked and despised by their
own votaries. So, too, treason is falsely laid to our charge, though no one has ever been able
to find followers of Albinus, or Niger, or Cassius, among Christians; while the very men
who had sworn by the genii of the emperors, who had offered and vowed sacrifices for their
safety, who had often pronounced condemnation on Christ’s disciples, are till this day found
traitors to the imperial throne. A Christian is enemy to none, least of all to the Emperor of
Rome, whom he knows to be appointed by his God, and so cannot but love and honour;
and whose well-being moreover, he must needs desire, with that of the empire over which
he reigns so long as the world shall stand—for so long as that shall Rome continue.447 To
the emperor, therefore, we render such reverential homage as is lawful for us and good for
him; regarding him as the human being next to God who from God has received all his
power, and is less than God alone. And this will be according to his own desires. For thus—as
less only than the true God—he is greater than all besides. Thus he is greater than the very
gods themselves, even they, too, being subject to him. We therefore sacrifice for the emperor’s
safety, but to our God and his, and after the manner God has enjoined, in simple prayer.
For God, Creator of the universe, has no need of odours or of blood. These things are the

food of devils.448 But we not only reject those wicked spirits: we overcome them; we daily
hold them up to contempt; we exorcise them from their victims, as multitudes can testify.
So all the more we pray for the imperial well-being, as those who seek it at the hands of Him
who is able to bestow it. And one would think it must be abundantly clear to you that the
religious system under whose rules we act is one inculcating a divine patience; since, though
our numbers are so great—constituting all but the majority in every city—we conduct
ourselves so quietly and modestly; I might perhaps say, known rather as individuals than
as organized communities, and remarkable only for the reformation of our former vices.
For far be it from us to take it ill that we have laid on us the very things we wish, or in any
way plot the vengeance at our own hands, which we expect to come from God.</p>

<p>However, as we have already remarked, it cannot but distress us that no state shall bear
unpunished the guilt of shedding Christian blood; as you see, indeed, in what took place
during the presidency of Hilarian, for when there had been some agitation about places of
sepulture for our dead, and the cry arose, “No areæ—no burial-grounds for the Christians,”
it came that their own areæ,449 their threshing-floors, were a-wanting, for they gathered in
no harvests. As to the rains of the bygone year, it is abundantly plain of what they were intended
to remind men—of the deluge, no doubt, which in ancient times overtook human
unbelief and wickedness; and as to the fires which lately hung all night over the walls of
Carthage, they who saw them know what they threatened; and what the preceding thunders
pealed, they who were hardened by them can tell. All these things are signs of God’s impending
wrath, which we must needs publish and proclaim in every possible way; and in the
meanwhile we must pray it may be only local. Sure are they to experience it one day in its
universal and final form, who interpret otherwise these samples of it. That sun, too, in the
metropolis of Utica,450 with light all but extinguished, was a portent which could not have
occurred from an ordinary eclipse, situated as the lord of day was in his height and house.
You have the astrologers, consult them about it. We can point you also to the deaths of some
provincial rulers, who in their last hours had painful memories of their sin in persecuting
the followers of Christ.451 Vigellius Saturninus, who first here used the sword against us,
lost his eyesight. Claudius Lucius Herminianus in Cappadocia, enraged that his wife had
become a Christian, had treated the Christians with great cruelty: well, left alone in his
palace, suffering under a contagious malady, he boiled out in living worms, and was heard
exclaiming, “Let nobody know of it, lest the Christians rejoice, and Christian wives take
encouragement.” Afterwards he came to see his error in having tempted so many from their
stedfastness by the tortures he inflicted, and died almost a Christian himself. In that doom
which overtook Byzantium,452 Cæcilius Capella could not help crying out, “Christians, rejoice!”
Yes, and the persecutors who seem to themselves to have acted with impunity shall
not escape the day of judgment. For you we sincerely wish it may prove to have been a
warning only, that, immediately after you had condemned Mavilus of Adrumetum to the
wild beasts, you were overtaken by those troubles, and that even now for the same reason
you are called to a blood-reckoning. But do not forget the future.</p>

<p>We who are without fear ourselves are not seeking to frighten you, but we would save
all men if possible by warning them not to fight with God.453 You may perform the duties
of your charge, and yet remember the claims of humanity; if on no other ground than that
you are liable to punishment yourself, (you ought to do so). For is not your commission
simply to condemn those who confess their guilt, and to give over to the torture those who
deny? You see, then, how you trespass yourselves against your instructions to wring from
the confessing a denial. It is, in fact, an acknowledgment of our innocence that you refuse
to condemn us at once when we confess. In doing your utmost to extirpate us, if that is your
object, it is innocence you assail. But how many rulers, men more resolute and more cruel
than you are, have contrived to get quit of such causes altogether,—as Cincius Severus, who
himself suggested the remedy at Thysdris, pointing out how the Christians should answer
that they might secure an acquittal; as Vespronius Candidus, who dismissed from his bar a
Christian, on the ground that to satisfy his fellow-citizens would break the peace of the
community; as Asper, who, in the case of a man who gave up his faith under slight infliction
of the torture, did not compel the offering of sacrifice, having owned before, among the
advocates and assessors of court, that he was annoyed at having had to meddle with such a
case. Pudens, too, at once dismissed a Christian who was brought before him, perceiving
from the indictment that it was a case of vexatious accusation; tearing the document in
pieces, he refused so much as to hear him without the presence of his accuser, as not being
consistent with the imperial commands. All this might be officially brought under your
notice, and by the very advocates, who are themselves also under obligations to us, although
in court they give their voice as it suits them. The clerk of one of them who was liable to be
thrown upon the ground by an evil spirit, was set free from his affliction; as was also the
relative of another, and the little boy of a third. How many men of rank (to say nothing of
common people) have been delivered from devils, and healed of diseases! Even Severus
himself, the father of Antonine, was graciously mindful of the Christians; for he sought out
the Christian Proculus, surnamed Torpacion, the steward of Euhodias, and in gratitude for
his having once cured him by anointing, he kept him in his palace till the day of his death.454
Antonine, too, brought up as he was on Christian milk, was intimately acquainted with this
man. Both women and men of highest rank, whom Severus knew well to be Christians, were
not merely permitted by him to remain uninjured; but he even bore distinguished testimony
in their favour, and gave them publicly back to us from the hands of a raging populace.

offered to God, got rain in that well-known thirst.455 When, indeed, have not droughts been
put away by our kneelings and our fastings? At times like these, moreover, the people crying
to “the God of gods, the alone Omnipotent,” under the name of Jupiter, have borne witness
to our God. Then we never deny the deposit placed in our hands; we never pollute the
marriage bed; we deal faithfully with our wards; we give aid to the needy; we render to none
evil for evil. As for those who falsely pretend to belong to us, and whom we, too, repudiate,
let them answer for themselves. In a word, who has complaint to make against us on other
grounds? To what else does the Christian devote himself, save the affairs of his own community,
which during all the long period of its existence no one has ever proved guilty of
the incest or the cruelty charged against it? It is for freedom from crime so singular, for a
probity so great, for righteousness, for purity, for faithfulness, for truth, for the living God,
that we are consigned to the flames; for this is a punishment you are not wont to inflict
either on the sacrilegious, or on undoubted public enemies, or on the treason-tainted, of
whom you have so many. Nay, even now our people are enduring persecution from the
governors of Legio and Mauritania; but it is only with the sword, as from the first it was
ordained that we should suffer. But the greater our conflicts, the greater our rewards.</p>

<p>Your cruelty is our glory. Only see you to it, that in having such things as these to endure,
we do not feel ourselves constrained to rush forth to the combat, if only to prove that we
have no dread of them, but on the contrary, even invite their infliction. When Arrius Antoninus
was driving things hard in Asia, the whole Christians of the province, in one united
band, presented themselves before his judgment-seat; on which, ordering a few to be led
forth to execution, he said to the rest, “O miserable men, if you wish to die, you have precipices
or halters.” If we should take it into our heads to do the same thing here, what will you
make of so many thousands, of such a multitude of men and women, persons of every sex
and every age and every rank, when they present themselves before you? How many fires,
how many swords will be required? What will be the anguish of Carthage itself, which you
will have to decimate,456 as each one recognises there his relatives and companions, as he
sees there it may be men of your own order, and noble ladies, and all the leading persons
of the city, and either kinsmen or friends of those of your own circle? Spare thyself, if not
us poor Christians! Spare Carthage, if not thyself! Spare the province, which the indication
of your purpose has subjected to the threats and extortions at once of the soldiers and of
private enemies.</p>
<p>We have no master but God. He is before you, and cannot be hidden from you, but to
Him you can do no injury. But those whom you regard as masters are only men, and one
day they themselves must die. Yet still this community will be undying, for be assured that
just in the time of its seeming overthrow it is built up into greater power. For all who witness
the noble patience of its martyrs, as struck with misgivings, are inflamed with desire to examine
into the matter in question;457 and as soon as they come to know the truth, they
straightway enrol themselves its disciples.</p>

(Scapula, cap. i., p. 105.)</p>
<p>Scapula was Proconsul of Carthage, and though its date is conjectural (a.d. 217), this
work gives valuable indices of its time and circumstances. It was composed after the death
of Severus, to whom there is an allusion in chapter iv., after the destruction of Byzantium
(a.d. 196), to which there is a reference in chapter iii.; and Dr. Allix suggests, after the dark
day of Utica (a.d. 210) which he supposes to be referred to in the same chapter. Cincius
Severus, who is mentioned in chapter iv., was put to death by Severus, a.d. 198.</p>

<p>Mr. Lewin (St. Paul, ii. 397), building on the fascinating theory of Archdeacon Williams,
thinks St. Paul’s Claudia (Qu. Gladys?) may very well have been the daughter of Caradoc,
with whose noble character we are made acquainted by Tacitus. (Annals xii. 36.) And
Archdeacon Williams gives us very strong reason to believe he was a Christian. He may very
well have lived to behold the Coliseum completed. What more natural then, in view of the
cruelty against Christians there exercised, for the expressions with which he is credited? In
this case his words contain an eloquent ambiguity, which Christians would appreciate, and
which may have been in our author’s mind when he says—“quousque sæculum stabit.” To
those who looked for the Second Advent, daily, this did not mean what the heathen might
suppose.</p>
<p>Bede’s version of the speech (See Du Cange, II., 407., ) is this: “Quandiu stabit Colyseus—

<head>Chapter I.459—The Hatred Felt by the Heathen Against the Christians is Unjust,
Because Based on Culpable Ignorance.</head>
<p>One proof of that ignorance of yours, which condemns460 whilst it excuses461 your injustice,
is at once apparent in the fact, that all who once shared in your ignorance and hatred
(of the Christian religion), as soon as they have come to know it, leave off their hatred when
they cease to be ignorant; nay more, they actually themselves become what they had hated,
and take to hating what they had once been. Day after day, indeed, you groan over the increasing
number of the Christians. Your constant cry is, that the state is beset (by us); that
Christians are in your fields, in your camps, in your islands. You grieve over it as a calamity,
that each sex, every age—in short, every rank—is passing over from you to us; yet you do
not even after this set your minds upon reflecting whether there be not here some latent
good. You do not allow yourselves in suspicions which may prove too true,462 nor do you
like ventures which may be too near the mark.463 This is the only instance in which human
curiosity grows torpid. You love to be ignorant of what other men rejoice to have discovered;
you would rather not know it, because you now cherish your hatred as if you were aware
<note type="footnote">458 [As a recapitulation I insert this here to close this class of argument for the reasons following.] This
treatise resembles The Apology, both in its general purport as a vindication of Christianity against heathen prejudice,
and in many of its expressions and statements. So great is the resemblance that this shorter work has
been thought by some to have been a first draft of the longer and perfect one. Tertullian, however, here addresses
his expostulations to the general public, while in The Apology it is the rulers and magistrates of the empire whom
he seeks to influence. [Dr. Allix conjectures the date of this treatise to be about a.d. 217. See Kaye, p. 50.]</note>

that, (with the knowledge,) your hatred would certainly come to an end. Still,464 if there
shall be no just ground for hatred, it will surely be found to be the best course to cease from
the past injustice. Should, however, a cause have really existed there will be no diminution
of the hatred, which will indeed accumulate so much the more in the consciousness of its
justice; unless it be, forsooth,465 that you are ashamed to cast off your faults,466 or sorry to
free yourselves from blame.467 I know very well with what answer you usually meet the argument
from our rapid increase.468 That indeed must not, you say, be hastily accounted a
good thing which converts a great number of persons, and gains them over to its side. I am
aware how the mind is apt to take to evil courses. How many there are which forsake virtuous
living! How many seek refuge in the opposite! Many, no doubt;469 nay, very many, as the
last days approach.470 But such a comparison as this fails in fairness of application; for all
are agreed in thinking thus of the evil-doer, so that not even the guilty themselves, who take
the wrong side, and turn away from the pursuit of good to perverse ways, are bold enough
to defend evil as good.471 Base things excite their fear, impious ones their shame. In short,
they are eager for concealment, they shrink from publicity, they tremble when caught; when
accused, they deny; even when tortured, they do not readily or invariably confess (their
crime); at all events,472 they grieve when they are condemned. They reproach themselves
for their past life; their change from innocence to an evil disposition they even attribute to
fate. They cannot say that it is not a wrong thing, therefore they will not admit it to be their
own act. As for the Christians, however, in what does their case resemble this? No one is
ashamed; no one is sorry, except for his former (sins).473 If he is pointed at (for his religion),
he glories in it; if dragged to trial, he does not resist; if accused, he makes no defence. When
questioned, he confesses; when condemned, he rejoices. What sort of evil is this, in which
the nature of evil comes to a standstill?474</p>

<head>Chapter II.475—The Heathen Perverted Judgment in the Trial of Christians. They
Would Be More Consistent If They Dispensed with All Form of Trial. Tertullian
Urges This with Much Indignation.</head>
<p>In this case you actually476 conduct trials contrary to the usual form of judicial process
against criminals; for when culprits are brought up for trial, should they deny the charge,
you press them for a confession by tortures. When Christians, however, confess without
compulsion, you apply the torture to induce them to deny. What great perverseness is this,
when you stand out against confession, and change the use of the torture, compelling the
man who frankly acknowledges the charge477 to evade it, and him who is unwilling, to deny
it? You, who preside for the purpose of extorting truth, demand falsehood from us alone
that we may declare ourselves not to be what we are. I suppose you do not want us to be
bad men, and therefore you earnestly wish to exclude us from that character. To be sure,478
you put others on the rack and the gibbet, to get them to deny what they have the reputation
of being. Now, when they deny (the charge against them), you do not believe them but on
our denial, you instantly believe us. If you feel sure that we are the most injurious of men,
why, even in processes against us, are we dealt with by you differently from other offenders?
I do not mean that you make no account of479 either an accusation or a denial (for your
practice is not hastily to condemn men without an indictment and a defence); but, to take
an instance in the trial of a murderer, the case is not at once ended, or the inquiry satisfied,
on a man’s confessing himself the murderer. However complete his confession,480 you do
not readily believe him; but over and above this, you inquire into accessory circumstances—
how often had he committed murder; with what weapons, in what place, with
what plunder, accomplices, and abettors after the fact481 (was the crime perpetrated)—to
the end that nothing whatever respecting the criminal might escape detection, and that
every means should be at hand for arriving at a true verdict. In our case, on the contrary,482
whom you believe to be guilty of more atrocious and numerous crimes, you frame your indictments483
in briefer and lighter terms. I suppose you do not care to load with accusations

men whom you earnestly wish to get rid of, or else you do not think it necessary to inquire
into matters which are known to you already. It is, however, all the more perverse that you
compel us to deny charges about which you have the clearest evidence. But, indeed,484 how
much more consistent were it with your hatred of us to dispense with all forms of judicial
process, and to strive with all your might not to urge us to say “No,” and so have to acquit
the objects of your hatred; but to confess all and singular the crimes laid to our charge, that
your resentments might be the better glutted with an accumulation of our punishments,
when it becomes known how many of those feasts each one of us may have celebrated, and
how many incests we may have committed under cover of the night! What am I saying?
Since your researches for rooting out our society must needs be made on a wide scale, you
ought to extend your inquiry against our friends and companions. Let our infanticides and
the dressers (of our horrible repasts) be brought out,—ay, and the very dogs which minister
to our (incestuous) nuptials;485 then the business (of our trial) would be without a fault.
Even to the crowds which throng the spectacles a zest would be given; for with how much
greater eagerness would they resort to the theatre, when one had to fight in the lists who
had devoured a hundred babies! For since such horrid and monstrous crimes are reported
of us, they ought, of course, to be brought to light, lest they should seem to be incredible,
and the public detestation of us should begin to cool. For most persons are slow to believe
such things,486 feeling a horrible disgust at supposing that our nature could have an appetite
for the food of wild beasts, when it has precluded these from all concubinage with the race
of man.</p>

guilty of most horrible crimes; that in the celebration of our sacrament we put a child to death, which we afterward
devour, and at the end of our banquet revel in incest; that we employ dogs as ministers of our impure delights,
to overthrow the candles, and thus to provide darkness, and remove all shame which might interfere with these
impious lusts” (Chevalier’s translation). These calumnies were very common, and are noticed by Justin Martyr,
Minucius Felix, Eusebius, Athenagoras, and Origen, who attributes their origin to the Jews. Oehler reads infantariæ,
after the Agobardine codex and editio princeps, and quotes Martial (Epigr. iv. 88), where the word occurs
in the sense of an inordinate love of children.</note>

<head>Chapter III.487—The Great Offence in the Christians Lies in Their Very Name. The Name Vindicated.</head>
<p>Since, therefore, you who are in other cases most scrupulous and persevering in investigating
charges of far less serious import, relinquish your care in cases like ours, which are
so horrible, and of such surpassing sin that impiety is too mild a word for them, by declining
to hear confession, which should always be an important process for those who conduct
judicial proceedings; and failing to make a full inquiry, which should be gone into by such
as sue for a condemnation, it becomes evident that the crime laid to our charge consists not
of any sinful conduct, but lies wholly in our name. If, indeed,488 any real crimes were clearly
adducible against us, their very names would condemn us, if found applicable,489 so that
distinct sentences would be pronounced against us in this wise: Let that murderer, or that
incestuous criminal, or whatever it be that we are charged with, be led to execution, be
crucified, or be thrown to the beasts. Your sentences, however,490 import only that one has
confessed himself a Christian. No name of a crime stands against us, but only the crime of
a name. Now this in very deed is neither more nor less than491 the entire odium which is
felt against us. The name is the cause: some mysterious force intensified by your ignorance
assails it, so that you do not wish to know for certain that which for certain you are sure you
know nothing of; and therefore, further, you do not believe things which are not submitted
to proof, and, lest they should be easily refuted,492 you refuse to make inquiry, so that the
odious name is punished under the presumption of (real) crimes. In order, therefore, that
the issue may be withdrawn from the offensive name, we are compelled to deny it; then
upon our denial we are acquitted, with an entire absolution493 for the past: we are no longer
murderers, no longer incestuous, because we have lost that name.494 But since this point is
dealt with in a place of its own,495 do you tell us plainly why you are pursuing this name
even to extirpation? What crime, what offence, what fault is there in a name? For you are
barred by the rule496 which puts it out of your power to allege crimes (of any man), which

no legal action moots, no indictment specifies, no sentence enumerates. In any case which
is submitted to the judge,497 inquired into against the defendant, responded to by him or
denied, and cited from the bench, I acknowledge a legal charge. Concerning, then, the
merit of a name, whatever offence names may be charged with, whatever impeachment
words may be amenable to, I for my part498 think, that not even a complaint is due to a
word or a name, unless indeed it has a barbarous sound, or smacks of ill-luck, or is immodest,
or is indecorous for the speaker, or unpleasant to the hearer. These crimes in (mere) words
and names are just like barbarous words and phrases, which have their fault, and their solecism,
and their absurdity of figure. The name Christian, however, so far as its meaning
goes, bears the sense of anointing. Even when by a faulty pronunciation you call us
“Chrestians” (for you are not certain about even the sound of this noted name), you in fact
lisp out the sense of pleasantness and goodness.499 You are therefore vilifying500 in harmless
men even the harmless name we bear, which is not inconvenient for the tongue, nor harsh
to the ear, nor injurious to a single being, nor rude for our country, being a good Greek
word, as many others also are, and pleasant in sound and sense. Surely, surely,501 names
are not things which deserve punishment by the sword, or the cross, or the beasts.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.502—The Truth Hated in the Christians; So in Measure Was It, of Old, in Socrates. The Virtues of the Christians.</head>
<p>But the sect, you say, is punished in the name of its founder. Now in the first place it is,
no doubt, a fair and usual custom that a sect should be marked out by the name of its founder,
since philosophers are called Pythagoreans and Platonists after their masters; in the same
way physicians are called after Erasistratus, and grammarians after Aristarchus. If, therefore,
a sect has a bad character because its founder was bad, it is punished503 as the traditional
bearer504 of a bad name. But this would be indulging in a rash assumption. The first step
was to find out what the founder was, that his sect might be understood, instead of hindering505
inquiry into the founder’s character from the sect. But in our case,506 by being necessarily
ignorant of the sect, through your ignorance of its founder, or else by not taking a fair
survey of the founder, because you make no inquiry into his sect, you fasten merely on the
name, just as if you vilified in it both sect and founder, whom you know nothing of whatever.
And yet you openly allow your philosophers the right of attaching themselves to any school,
and bearing its founder’s name as their own; and nobody stirs up any hatred against them,
although both in public and in private they bark out507 their bitterest eloquence against
your customs, rites, ceremonies, and manner of life, with so much contempt for the laws,
and so little respect for persons, that they even flaunt their licentious words508 against the
emperors themselves with impunity. And yet it is the truth, which is so troublesome to the
world, that these philosophers affect, but which Christians possess: they therefore who have
it in possession afford the greater displeasure, because he who affects a thing plays with it;
he who possesses it maintains it. For example,509 Socrates was condemned on that side (of
his wisdom) in which he came nearest in his search to the truth, by destroying your gods.
Although the name of Christian was not at that time in the world, yet truth was always suffering
condemnation. Now you will not deny that he was a wise man, to whom your own
Pythian (god) had borne witness. Socrates, he said, was the wisest of men. Truth overbore
Apollo, and made him pronounce even against himself since he acknowledged that he was
no god, when he affirmed that that was the wisest man who was denying the gods. How-

ever,510 on your principle he was the less wise because he denied the gods, although, in
truth, he was all the wiser by reason of this denial. It is just in the same way that you are in
the habit of saying of us: “Lucius Titius is a good man, only he is a Christian;” while another
says; “I wonder that so worthy511 a man as Caius Seius has become a Christian.”512 According
to513 the blindness of their folly men praise what they know, (and) blame what they are ignorant
of; and that which they know, they vitiate by that which they do not know. It occurs
to none (to consider) whether a man is not good and wise because he is a Christian, or
therefore a Christian because he is wise and good, although it is more usual in human conduct
to determine obscurities by what is manifest, than to prejudice what is manifest by what is
obscure. Some persons wonder that those whom they had known to be unsteady, worthless,
or wicked before they bore this514 name, have been suddenly converted to virtuous courses;
and yet they better know how to wonder (at the change) than to attain to it; others are so
obstinate in their strife as to do battle with their own best interests, which they have it in
their power to secure by intercourse515 with that hated name. I know more than one516
husband, formerly anxious about their wives’ conduct, and unable to bear even mice to
creep into their bed-room without a groan of suspicion, who have, upon discovering the
cause of their new assiduity, and their unwonted attention to the duties of home,517 offered
the entire loan of their wives to others,518 disclaimed all jealousy, (and) preferred to be the
husbands of she-wolves than of Christian women: they could commit themselves to a perverse
abuse of nature, but they could not permit their wives to be reformed for the better! A
father disinherited his son, with whom he had ceased to find fault. A master sent his slave
to bridewell,519 whom he had even found to be indispensable to him. As soon as they discovered
them to be Christians, they wished they were criminals again; for our discipline
carries its own evidence in itself, nor are we betrayed by anything else than our own goodness,
just as bad men also become conspicuous520 by their own evil. Else how is it that we alone
are, contrary to the lessons of nature, branded as very evil because of our good? For what

<head>Chapter V.522—The Inconsistent Life of Any False Christian No More Condemns
True Disciples of Christ, Than a Passing Cloud Obscures a Summer Sky.</head>
<p>As to your saying of us that we are a most shameful set, and utterly steeped in luxury,
avarice, and depravity, we will not deny that this is true of some. It is, however, a sufficient
testimonial for our name, that this cannot be said of all, not even of the greater part of us.
It must happen even in the healthiest and purest body, that a mole should grow, or a wart
arise on it, or freckles disfigure it. Not even the sky itself is clear with so perfect523 a serenity
as not to be flecked with some filmy cloud.524 A slight spot on the face, because it is obvious
in so conspicuous a part, only serves to show purity of the entire complexion. The goodness
of the larger portion is well attested by the slender flaw. But although you prove that some
of our people are evil, you do not hereby prove that they are Christians. Search and see
whether there is any sect to which (a partial shortcoming) is imputed as a general stain.525
You are accustomed in conversation yourselves to say, in disparagement of us, “Why is soand-
so deceitful, when the Christians are so self-denying? why merciless, when they are so
merciful?” You thus bear your testimony to the fact that this is not the character of Christians,
when you ask, in the way of a retort,526 how men who are reputed to be Christians can be
of such and such a disposition. There is a good deal of difference between an imputation
and a name,527 between an opinion and the truth. For names were appointed for the express
purpose of setting their proper limits between mere designation and actual condition.528
How many indeed are said to be philosophers, who for all that do not fulfil the law of
philosophy? All bear the name in respect of their profession; but they hold the designation
without the excellence of the profession, and they disgrace the real thing under the shallow
pretence of its name. Men are not straightway of such and such a character, because they
are said to be so; but when they are not, it is vain to say so of them: they only deceive people
who attach reality to a name, when it is its consistency with fact which decides the condition
implied in the name.529 And yet persons of this doubtful stamp do not assemble with us,
neither do they belong to our communion: by their delinquency they become yours once
more530 since we should be unwilling to mix even with them whom your violence and

<head>Chapter VI.531—The Innocence of the Christians Not Compromised by the Iniquitous Laws Which Were Made Against Them.</head>
<p>Whenever these statements and answers of ours, which truth suggests of its own accord,
press and restrain your conscience, which is the witness of its own ignorance, you betake
yourselves in hot haste to that poor altar of refuge,532 the authority of the laws, because
these, of course, would never punish the offensive533 sect, if their deserts had not been fully
considered by those who made the laws. Then what is it which has prevented a like consideration
on the part of those who put the laws in force, when, in the case of all other crimes
which are similarly forbidden and punished by the laws, the penalty is not inflicted534 until
it is sought by regular process?535 Take,536 for instance, the case of a murderer or an
adulterer. An examination is ordered touching the particulars537 of the crime, even though
it is patent to all what its nature538 is. Whatever wrong has been done by the Christian ought
to be brought to light. No law forbids inquiry to be made; on the contrary, inquiry is made
in the interest of the laws.539 For how are you to keep the law by precautions against that
which the law forbids, if you neutralize the carefulness of the precaution by your failing to
perceive540 what it is you have to keep? No law must keep to itself541 the knowledge of its
own righteousness,542 but (it owes it) to those from whom it claims obedience. The law,
however, becomes an object of suspicion when it declines to approve itself. Naturally
enough,543 then, are the laws against the Christians supposed to be just and deserving of
respect and observance, just as long as men remain ignorant of their aim and purport; but
when this is perceived, their extreme injustice is discovered, and they are deservedly rejected
with abhorrence,544 along with (their instruments of torture)—the swords, the crosses, and

Deception and Atrocious Slanders of the Christians Lengthily Described.</head>
<p>Whence comes it to pass, you will say to us, that such a character could have been attributed
to you, as to have justified the lawmakers perhaps by its imputation? Let me ask on my
side, what voucher they had then, or you now, for the truth of the imputation? (You answer,)
Fame. Well, now, is not this—
<lg>
<l>“Fama malum, quo non aliud velocius ullum?”546</l>

</p>
<p>Now, why a plague,547 if it be always true? It never ceases from lying; nor even at the
moment when it reports the truth is it so free from the wish to lie, as not to interweave the
false with the true, by processes of addition, diminution, or confusion of various facts. Indeed,
548 such is its condition, that it can only continue to exist while it lies. For it lives only
just so long as it fails to prove anything. As soon as it proves itself true, it falls; and, as if its
office of reporting news were at an end, it quits its post: thenceforward the thing is held to
be a fact, and it passes under that name. No one, then, says, to take an instance, “The report
is that this happened at Rome,” or, “The rumour goes that he has got a province;” but, “He
has got a province,” and, “This happened at Rome.” Nobody mentions a rumour except at
an uncertainty, because nobody can be sure of a rumour, but only of certain knowledge;
and none but a fool believes a rumour, because no wise man puts faith in an uncertainty.
In however wide a circuit549 a report has been circulated, it must needs have originated
some time or other from one mouth; afterwards it creeps on somehow to ears and tongues
which pass it on550 and so obscures the humble error in which it began, that no one considers
whether the mouth which first set it a-going disseminated a falsehood,—a circumstance
which often happens either from a temper of rivalry, or a suspicious turn, or even the
pleasure of feigning news. It is, however, well that time reveals all things, as your own sayings
and proverbs testify; yea, as nature herself attests, which has so ordered it that nothing lies
hid, not even that which fame has not reported. See, now, what a witness551 you have suborned
against us: it has not been able up to this time to prove the report it set in motion,
although it has had so long a time to recommend it to our acceptance. This name of ours
took its rise in the reign of Augustus; under Tiberius it was taught with all clearness and

publicity;552 under Nero it was ruthlessly condemned,553 and you may weigh its worth and
character even from the person of its persecutor. If that prince was a pious man, then the
Christians are impious; if he was just, if he was pure, then the Christians are unjust and
impure; if he was not a public enemy, we are enemies of our country: what sort of men we
are, our persecutor himself shows, since he of course punished what produced hostility to
himself.554 Now, although every other institution which existed under Nero has been destroyed,
yet this of ours has firmly remained—righteous, it would seem, as being unlike the
author (of its persecution). Two hundred and fifty years, then, have not yet passed since our
life began. During the interval there have been so many criminals; so many crosses have
obtained immortality;555 so many infants have been slain; so many loaves steeped in blood;
so many extinctions of candles;556 so many dissolute marriages. And up to the present time
it is mere report which fights against the Christians. No doubt it has a strong support in the
wickedness of the human mind, and utters its falsehoods with more success among cruel
and savage men. For the more inclined you are to maliciousness, the more ready are you to
believe evil; in short, men more easily believe the evil that is false, than the good which is
true. Now, if injustice has left any place within you for the exercise of prudence in investig-
ating the truth of reports, justice of course demanded that you should examine by whom
the report could have been spread among the multitude, and thus circulated through the
world. For it could not have been by the Christians themselves, I suppose, since by the very
constitution and law of all mysteries the obligation of silence is imposed. How much more
would this be the case in such (mysteries as are ascribed to us), which, if divulged, could
not fail to bring down instant punishment from the prompt resentment of men! Since,
therefore, the Christians are not their own betrayers, it follows that it must be strangers.
Now I ask, how could strangers obtain knowledge of us, when even true and lawful mysteries
exclude every stranger from witnessing them, unless illicit ones are less exclusive? Well,
then, it is more in keeping with the character of strangers both to be ignorant (of the true
state of a case), and to invent (a false account). Our domestic servants (perhaps) listened,
and peeped through crevices and holes, and stealthily got information of our ways. What,
then, shall we say when our servants betray them to you?557 It is better, (to be sure,)558 for
us all not to be betrayed by any; but still, if our practices be so atrocious, how much more

proper is it when a righteous indignation bursts asunder even all ties of domestic fidelity?
How was it possible for it to endure what horrified the mind and affrighted the eye? This is
also a wonderful thing, both that he who was so overcome with impatient excitement as to
turn informer,559 did not likewise desire to prove (what he reported), and that he who heard
the informer’s story did not care to see for himself, since no doubt the reward560 is equal
both for the informer who proves what he reports, and for the hearer who convinces himself
of the credibility561 of what he hears. But then you say that (this is precisely what has taken
place): first came the rumour, then the exhibition of the proof; first the hearsay, then the
inspection; and after this, fame received its commission. Now this, I must say,562 surpasses
all admiration, that that was once for all detected and divulged which is being for ever repeated,
unless, forsooth, we have by this time ceased from the reiteration of such things563
(as are alleged of us). But we are called still by the same (offensive) name, and we are supposed
to be still engaged in the same practices, and we multiply from day to day; the more564 we
are, to the more become we objects of hatred. Hatred increases as the material for it increases.
Now, seeing that the multitude of offenders is ever advancing, how is it that the crowd of
informers does not keep equal pace therewith? To the best of my belief, even our manner
of life565 has become better known; you know the very days of our assemblies; therefore we
are both besieged, and attacked, and kept prisoners actually in our secret congregations.
Yet who ever came upon a half-consumed corpse (amongst us)? Who has detected the traces
of a bite in our blood-steeped loaf? Who has discovered, by a sudden light invading our
darkness, any marks of impurity, I will not say of incest, (in our feasts)? If we save ourselves
by a bribe566 from being dragged out before the public gaze with such a character, how is
it that we are still oppressed? We have it indeed in our own power not to be thus apprehended
at all; for who either sells or buys information about a crime, if the crime itself has no existence?
But why need I disparagingly refer to567 strange spies and informers, when you allege
against us such charges as we certainly do not ourselves divulge with very much noise—either
as soon as you hear of them, if we previously show them to you, or after you have yourselves
discovered them, if they are for the time concealed from you? For no doubt,568 when any

desire initiation in the mysteries, their custom is first to go to the master or father of the
sacred rites. Then he will say (to the applicant), You must bring an infant, as a guarantee
for our rites, to be sacrificed, as well as some bread to be broken and dipped in his blood;
you also want candles, and dogs tied together to upset them, and bits of meat to rouse the
dogs. Moreover, a mother too, or a sister, is necessary for you. What, however, is to be said
if you have neither? I suppose in that case you could not be a genuine Christian. Now, do
let me ask you, Will such things, when reported by strangers, bear to be spread about (as
charges against us)? It is impossible for such persons to understand proceedings in which
they take no part.569 The first step of the process is perpetrated with artifice; our feasts and
our marriages are invented and detailed570 by ignorant persons, who had never before heard
about Christian mysteries. And though they afterwards cannot help acquiring some knowledge
of them, it is even then as having to be administered by others whom they bring on
the scene.571 Besides, how absurd is it that the profane know mysteries which the priest
knows not! They keep them all to themselves, then,572 and take them for granted; and so
these tragedies, (worse than those) of Thyestes or OEdipus, do not at all come forth to light,
nor find their way573 to the public. Even more voracious bites take nothing away from the

allegations can be proved to be true, how incalculable must be esteemed the grandeur (of
that religion) which is manifestly not overbalanced even by the burden of these vast atrocities!
O ye heathen; who have and deserve our pity,575 behold, we set before you the promise
which our sacred system offers. It guarantees eternal life to such as follow and observe it;
on the other hand, it threatens with the eternal punishment of an unending fire those who
are profane and hostile; while to both classes alike is preached a resurrection from the dead.

to know whether you are ready to reach them, as we do, through such crimes. Come, whosoever
you are, plunge your sword into an infant; or if that is another’s office, then simply

recline. Carefully distinguish the places where your mother or your sister may have made
their bed; mark them well, in order that, when the shades of night have fallen upon them,
putting of course to the test the care of every one of you, you may not make the awkward
mistake of alighting on somebody else:580 you would have to make an atonement, if you
failed of the incest. When you have effected all this, eternal life will be in store for you. I
want you to tell me whether you think eternal life worth such a price. No, indeed,581 you

Why should you be able if others are unable? What would you wish impunity (and) eternity

<head>Chapter VIII.585—The Calumny Against the Christians Illustrated in the Discovery of Psammetichus. Refutation of the Story.</head>
<p>We are indeed said to be the “third race” of men. What, a dog-faced race?586 Or broadly
shadow-footed?587 Or some subterranean588 Antipodes? If you attach any meaning to these
names, pray tell us what are the first and the second race, that so we may know something
of this “third.” Psammetichus thought that he had hit upon the ingenious discovery of the
primeval man. He is said to have removed certain new-born infants from all human intercourse,
and to have entrusted them to a nurse, whom he had previously deprived of her
tongue, in order that, being completely exiled from all sound of the human voice, they might
form their speech without hearing it; and thus, deriving it from themselves alone, might
indicate what that first nation was whose speech was dictated by nature. Their first utterance
was Bekkos, a word which means “bread” in the language of Phrygia: the Phrygians, therefore,
are supposed to be the first of the human race.589 But it will not be out of place if we make
one observation, with a view to show how your faith abandons itself more to vanities than
to verities. Can it be, then, at all credible that the nurse retained her life, after the loss of so
important a member, the very organ of the breath of life,590—cut out, too, from the very
root, with her throat591 mutilated, which cannot be wounded even on the outside without
danger, and the putrid gore flowing back to the chest, and deprived for so long a time of
her food? Come, even suppose that by the remedies of a Philomela she retained her life, in
the way supposed by wisest persons, who account for the dumbness not by cutting out the
tongue, but from the blush of shame; if on such a supposition she lived, she would still be
able to blurt out some dull sound. And a shrill inarticulate noise from opening the mouth
only, without any modulation of the lips, might be forced from the mere throat, though
there were no tongue to help. This, it is probable, the infants readily imitated, and the more
so because it was the only sound; only they did it a little more neatly, as they had tongues;592
and then they attached to it a definite signification. Granted, then, that the Phrygians were
the earliest race, it does not follow that the Christians are the third. For how many other
nations come regularly after the Phrygians? Take care, however, lest those whom you call

the third race should obtain the first rank, since there is no nation indeed which is not
Christian. Whatever nation, therefore, was the first, is nevertheless Christian now.593 It is
ridiculous folly which makes you say we are the latest race, and then specifically call us the
third. But it is in respect of our religion,594 not of our nation, that we are supposed to be
the third; the series being the Romans, the Jews, and the Christians after them. Where, then,
are the Greeks? or if they are reckoned amongst the Romans in regard to their superstition
(since it was from Greece that Rome borrowed even her gods), where at least are the Egyptians,
since these have, so far as I know, a mysterious religion peculiar to themselves? Now,
if they who belong to the third race are so monstrous, what must they be supposed to be

<p>But why should I be astonished at your vain imputations? Under the same natural form,
malice and folly have always been associated in one body and growth, and have ever opposed
us under the one instigator of error.596 Indeed, I feel no astonishment; and therefore, as it
is necessary for my subject, I will enumerate some instances, that you may feel the astonishment
by the enumeration of the folly into which you fall, when you insist on our being the
causes of every public calamity or injury. If the Tiber has overflowed its banks, if the Nile
has remained in its bed, if the sky has been still, or the earth been in commotion, if death597
has made its devastations, or famine its afflictions, your cry immediately is, “This is the
fault598 of the Christians!” As if they who fear the true God could have to fear a light thing,
or at least anything else (than an earthquake or famine, or such visitations).599 I suppose it
is as despisers of your gods that we call down on us these strokes of theirs. As we have remarked
already,600 three hundred years have not yet passed in our existence; but what vast
scourges before that time fell on all the world, on its various cities and provinces! what terrible
wars, both foreign and domestic! what pestilences, famines, conflagrations, yawnings, and
quakings of the earth has history recorded!601 Where were the Christians, then, when the
Roman state furnished so many chronicles of its disasters? Where were the Christians when
the islands Hiera, Anaphe, and Delos, and Rhodes, and Cea were desolated with multitudes
of men? or, again, when the land mentioned by Plato as larger than Asia or Africa was sunk
in the Atlantic Sea? or when fire from heaven overwhelmed Volsinii, and flames from their
own mountain consumed Pompeii? when the sea of Corinth was engulphed by an earthquake?
when the whole world was destroyed by the deluge? Where then were (I will not say the
Christians, who despise your gods, but) your gods themselves, who are proved to be of later
origin than that great ruin by the very places and cities in which they were born, sojourned,
and were buried, and even those which they founded? For else they would not have remained

insignificance; for they would not be angry with you for loitering over our punishment, if
they could do anything themselves,—although you admit the same thing indeed in another

of Them Often Displayed by Heathen Official Persons. Homer Made the Gods
Contemptible.</head>
<p>Pour out now all your venom; fling against this name of ours all your shafts of calumny:
I shall stay no longer to refute them; but they shall by and by be blunted, when we come to
explain our entire discipline.605 I shall content myself now indeed with plucking these shafts
out of our own body, and hurling them back on yourselves. The same wounds which you
have inflicted on us by your charges I shall show to be imprinted on yourselves, that you
may fall by your own swords and javelins.606 Now, first, when you direct against us the
general charge of divorcing ourselves from the institutions of our forefathers, consider again
and again whether you are not yourselves open to that accusation in common with us. For
when I look through your life and customs, lo, what do I discover but the old order of things
corrupted, nay, destroyed by you? Of the laws I have already said, that you are daily supplanting
them with novel decrees and statutes. As to everything else in your manner of life,
how great are the changes you have made from your ancestors—in your style, your dress,
your equipage, your very food, and even in your speech; for the old-fashioned you banish,
as if it were offensive to you! Everywhere, in your public pursuits and private duties, antiquity
is repealed; all the authority of your forefathers your own authority has superseded. To be
sure,607 you are for ever praising old customs; but this is only to your greater discredit, for
you nevertheless persistently reject them. How great must your perverseness have been, to
have bestowed approbation on your ancestors’ institutions, which were too inefficient to
be lasting, all the while that you were rejecting the very objects of your approbation! But
even that very heir-loom608 of your forefathers, which you seem to guard and defend with
greatest fidelity, in which you actually609 find your strongest grounds for impeaching us as
violators of the law, and from which your hatred of the Christian name derives all its life—I
mean the worship of the gods—I shall prove to be undergoing ruin and contempt from
yourselves no less than610 (from us),—unless it be that there is no reason for our being regarded
as despisers of the gods like yourselves, on the ground that nobody despises what
he knows has absolutely no existence. What certainly exists can be despised. That which

is nothing, suffers nothing. From those, therefore, to whom it is an existing thing,611 must
necessarily proceed the suffering which affects it. All the heavier, then, is the accusation
which burdens you who believe that there are gods and (at the same time) despise them,
who worship and also reject them, who honour and also assail them. One may also gather
the same conclusion from this consideration, above all: since you worship various gods,
some one and some another, you of course despise those which you do not worship. A
preference for the one is not possible without slighting the other, and no choice can be made
without a rejection. He who selects some one out of many, has already slighted the other
which he does not select. But it is impossible that so many and so great gods can be worshipped
by all. Then you must have exercised your contempt (in this matter) even at the
beginning, since indeed you were not then afraid of so ordering things, that all the gods
could not become objects of worship to all. For those very wise and prudent ancestors of
yours, whose institutions you know not how to repeal, especially in respect of your gods,
are themselves found to have been impious. I am much mistaken, if they did not sometimes
decree that no general should dedicate a temple, which he may have vowed in battle, before
the senate gave its sanction; as in the case of Marcus Æmilius, who had made a vow to the
god Alburnus. Now is it not confessedly the greatest impiety, nay, the greatest insult, to
place the honour of the Deity at the will and pleasure of human judgment, so that there
cannot be a god except the senate permit him? Many times have the censors destroyed612
(a god) without consulting the people. Father Bacchus, with all his ritual, was certainly by
the consuls, on the senate’s authority, cast not only out of the city, but out of all Italy; whilst
Varro informs us that Serapis also, and Isis, and Arpocrates, and Anubis, were excluded
from the Capitol, and that their altars which the senate had thrown down were only restored
by the popular violence. The Consul Gabinius, however, on the first day of the ensuing
January, although he gave a tardy consent to some sacrifices, in deference to the crowd
which assembled, because he had failed to decide about Serapis and Isis, yet held the judgment
of the senate to be more potent than the clamour of the multitude, and forbade the altars
to be built. Here, then, you have amongst your own forefathers, if not the name, at all events
the procedure,613 of the Christians, which despises the gods. If, however, you were even
innocent of the charge of treason against them in the honour you pay them, I still find that
you have made a consistent advance in superstition as well as impiety. For how much more
irreligious are you found to be! There are your household gods, the Lares and the Penates,
which you possess614 by a family consecration:615 you even tread them profanely under

foot, you and your domestics, by hawking and pawning them for your wants or your whims.
Such insolent sacrilege might be excusable, if it were not practised against your humbler
deities; as it is, the case is only the more insolent. There is, however, some consolation for
your private household gods under these affronts, that you treat your public deities with
still greater indignity and insolence. First of all, you advertise them for auction, submit them
to public sale, knock them down to the highest bidder, when you every five years bring them
to the hammer among your revenues. For this purpose you frequent the temple of Serapis
or the Capitol, hold your sales there,616 conclude your contracts,617 as if they were markets,
with the well-known618 voice of the crier, (and) the self-same levy619 of the quæstor. Now
lands become cheaper when burdened with tribute, and men by the capitation tax diminish
in value (these are the well-known marks of slavery). But the gods, the more tribute they
pay, become more holy; or rather,620 the more holy they are, the more tribute do they pay.
Their majesty is converted into an article of traffic; men drive a business with their religion;
the sanctity of the gods is beggared with sales and contracts. You make merchandise of the
ground of your temples, of the approach to your altars, of your offerings,621 of your sacrifices.
622 You sell the whole divinity (of your gods). You will not permit their gratuitous
worship. The auctioneers necessitate more repairs623 than the priests.</p>
<p>It was not enough that you had insolently made a profit of your gods, if we would test
the amount of your contempt; and you are not content to have withheld honour from them,
you must also depreciate the little you do render to them by some indignity or other. What,
indeed, do you do by way of honouring your gods, which you do not equally offer to your
dead? You build temples for the gods, you erect temples also to the dead; you build altars
for the gods, you build them also for the dead; you inscribe the same superscription over
both; you sketch out the same lineaments for their statues—as best suits their genius, or
profession, or age; you make an old man of Saturn, a beardless youth of Apollo; you form
a virgin from Diana; in Mars you consecrate a soldier, a blacksmith in Vulcan. No wonder,
therefore, if you slay the same victims and burn the same odours for your dead as you do
for your gods. What excuse can be found for that insolence which classes the dead of whatever
sort624 as equal with the gods? Even to your princes there are assigned the services of priests

and sacred ceremonies, and chariots,625 and cars, and the honours of the solisternia and the
lectisternia, holidays and games. Rightly enough,626 since heaven is open to them; still it is
none the less contumelious to the gods: in the first place, because it could not possibly be
decent that other beings should be numbered with them, even if it has been given to them
to become divine after their birth; in the second place, because the witness who beheld the
man caught up into heaven627 would not forswear himself so freely and palpably before the
people, if it were not for the contempt felt about the objects sworn to both by himself and
those628 who allow the perjury. For these feel of themselves, that what is sworn to is nothing;
and more than that, they go so far as to fee the witness, because he had the courage to publicly
despise the avengers of perjury. Now, as to that, who among you is pure of the charge of
perjury? By this time, indeed, there is an end to all danger in swearing by the gods, since
the oath by Cæsar carries with it more influential scruples, which very circumstance indeed
tends to the degradation of your gods; for those who perjure themselves when swearing by
Cæsar are more readily punished than those who violate an oath to a Jupiter. But, of the
two kindred feelings of contempt and derision, contempt is the more honourable, having
a certain glory in its arrogance; for it sometimes proceeds from confidence, or the security
of consciousness, or a natural loftiness of mind. Derision, however, is a more wanton feeling,
and so far it points more directly629 to a carping insolence. Now only consider what great
deriders of your gods you show yourselves to be! I say nothing of your indulgence of this
feeling during your sacrificial acts, how you offer for your victims the poorest and most
emaciated creatures; or else of the sound and healthy animals only the portions which are
useless for food, such as the heads and hoofs, or the plucked feathers and hair, and whatever
at home you would have thrown away. I pass over whatever may seem to the taste630 of the
vulgar and profane to have constituted the religion631 of your forefathers; but then the most
learned and serious classes (for seriousness and wisdom to some extent632 profess633 to be
derived from learning) are always, in fact, the most irreverent towards your gods; and if
their learning ever halts, it is only to make up for the remissness by a more shameful invention

of follies and falsehoods about their gods. I will begin with that enthusiastic fondness which
you show for him from whom every depraved writer gets his dreams, to whom you ascribe
as much honour as you derogate from your gods, by magnifying him who has made such
sport of them. I mean Homer by this description. He it is, in my opinion, who has treated
the majesty of the Divine Being on the low level of human condition, imbuing the gods with
the falls634 and the passions of men; who has pitted them against each other with varying
success, like pairs of gladiators: he wounds Venus with an arrow from a human hand; he
keeps Mars a prisoner in chains for thirteen months, with the prospect of perishing;635 he
parades636 Jupiter as suffering a like indignity from a crowd of celestial (rebels;) or he draws
from him tears for Sarpedon; or he represents him wantoning with Juno in the most disgraceful
way, advocating his incestuous passion for her by a description and enumeration
of his various amours. Since then, which of the poets has not, on the authority of their great
prince, calumniated the gods, by either betraying truth or feigning falsehood? Have the
dramatists also, whether in tragedy or comedy, refrained from making the gods the authors637
of the calamities and retributions (of their plays)? I say nothing of your philosophers, whom
a certain inspiration of truth itself elevates against the gods, and secures from all fear in their
proud severity and stern discipline. Take, for example,638 Socrates. In contempt of your
gods, he swears by an oak, and a dog, and a goat. Now, although he was condemned to die
for this very reason, the Athenians afterwards repented of that condemnation, and even put
to death his accusers. By this conduct of theirs the testimony of Socrates is replaced at its
full value, and I am enabled to meet you with this retort, that in his case you have approbation
bestowed on that which is now-a-days reprobated in us. But besides this instance there is
Diogenes, who, I know not to what extent, made sport of Hercules; whilst Varro, that Diogenes
of the Roman cut,639 introduces to our view some three hundred Joves, or, as they
ought to be called, Jupiters,640 (and all) without heads. Your other wanton wits641 likewise
minister to your pleasures by disgracing the gods. Examine carefully the sacrilegious642
beauties of your Lentuli and Hostii; now, is it the players or your gods who become the objects
of your mirth in their tricks and jokes? Then, again, with what pleasure do you take up the

literature of the stage, which describes all the foul conduct of the gods! Their majesty is defiled
in your presence in some unchaste body. The mask of some deity, at your will,643 covers
some infamous paltry head. The Sun mourns for the death of his son by a lightning-flash
amid your rude rejoicing. Cybele sighs for a shepherd who disdains her, without raising a
blush on your cheek; and you quietly endure songs which celebrate644 the gallantries of
Jove. You are, of course, possessed of a more religious spirit in the show of your gladiators,
when your gods dance, with equal zest, over the spilling of human blood, (and) over those
filthy penalties which are at once their proof and plot for executing your criminals, or else
(when) your criminals are punished personating the gods themselves.645 We have often
witnessed in a mutilated criminal your god of Pessinum, Attis; a wretch burnt alive has
personated Hercules. We have laughed at the sport of your mid-day game of the gods, when
Father Pluto, Jove’s own brother, drags away, hammer in hand, the remains of the gladiators;
when Mercury, with his winged cap and heated wand, tests with his cautery whether the
bodies were really lifeless, or only feigning death. Who now can investigate every particular

of being so represented.649 I hardly know, therefore, whether your gods have more

some criminals had to play the part of Orpheus; others of Mutius Scævola. It will be observed that these executions

yielding up his own life. The indignant irony of the whole passage, led off by the “plane religiosiores estis,” is

<head>Chapter XI.651—The Absurd Cavil of the Ass’s Head Disposed of.</head>
<p>In this matter we are (said to be) guilty not merely of forsaking the religion of the
community, but of introducing a monstrous superstition; for some among you have dreamed
that our god is an ass’s head,—an absurdity which Cornelius Tacitus first suggested. In the
fourth book of his histories,652 where he is treating of the Jewish war, he begins his description
with the origin of that nation, and gives his own views respecting both the origin and the
name of their religion. He relates that the Jews, in their migration in the desert, when suffering
for want of water, escaped by following for guides some wild asses, which they supposed to
be going in quest of water after pasture, and that on this account the image of one of these
animals was worshipped by the Jews. From this, I suppose, it was presumed that we, too,
from our close connection with the Jewish religion, have ours consecrated under the same
emblematic form. The same Cornelius Tacitus, however,—who, to say the truth, is most
loquacious in falsehood—forgetting his later statement, relates how Pompey the Great, after
conquering the Jews and capturing Jerusalem, entered the temple, but found nothing in the
shape of an image, though he examined the place carefully. Where, then, should their God
have been found? Nowhere else, of course, than in so memorable a temple which was carefully
shut to all but the priests, and into which there could be no fear of a stranger entering. But
what apology must I here offer for what I am going to say, when I have no other object at
the moment than to make a passing remark or two in a general way which shall be equally
applicable to yourselves?653 Suppose that our God, then, be an asinine person, will you at
all events deny that you possess the same characteristics with ourselves in that matter? (Not
their heads only, but) entire asses, are, to be sure, objects of adoration to you, along with
their tutelar Epona; and all herds, and cattle, and beasts you consecrate, and their stables
into the bargain! This, perhaps, is your grievance against us, that, when surrounded by
cattle-worshippers of every kind we are simply devoted to asses!</p>

<head>Chapter XII.654—The Charge of Worshipping a Cross. The Heathens Themselves
Made Much of Crosses in Sacred Things; Nay, Their Very Idols Were Formed
on a Crucial Frame.</head>
<p>As for him who affirms that we are “the priesthood of a cross,”655 we shall claim him656
as our co-religionist.657 A cross is, in its material, a sign of wood; amongst yourselves also
the object of worship is a wooden figure. Only, whilst with you the figure is a human one,
with us the wood is its own figure. Never mind658 for the present what is the shape, provided
the material is the same: the form, too, is of no importance,659 if so be it be the actual body
of a god. If, however, there arises a question of difference on this point what, (let me ask,)
is the difference between the Athenian Pallas, or the Pharian Ceres, and wood formed into
a cross,660 when each is represented by a rough stock, without form, and by the merest
rudiment of a statue661 of unformed wood? Every piece of timber662 which is fixed in the
ground in an erect position is a part of a cross, and indeed the greater portion of its mass.
But an entire cross is attributed to us, with its transverse beam,663 of course, and its projecting
seat. Now you have the less to excuse you, for you dedicate to religion only a mutilated imperfect
piece of wood, while others consecrate to the sacred purpose a complete structure.
The truth, however, after all is, that your religion is all cross, as I shall show. You are indeed
unaware that your gods in their origin have proceeded from this hated cross.664 Now, every
image, whether carved out of wood or stone, or molten in metal, or produced out of any
other richer material, must needs have had plastic hands engaged in its formation. Well,
then, this modeller,665 before he did anything else,666 hit upon the form of a wooden cross,
because even our own body assumes as its natural position the latent and concealed outline
of a cross. Since the head rises upwards, and the back takes a straight direction, and the

shoulders project laterally, if you simply place a man with his arms and hands outstretched,
you will make the general outline of a cross. Starting, then, from this rudimental form and
prop,667 as it were, he applies a covering of clay, and so gradually completes the limbs, and
forms the body, and covers the cross within with the shape which he meant to impress upon
the clay; then from this design, with the help of compasses and leaden moulds, he has got
all ready for his image which is to be brought out into marble, or clay, or whatever the material
be of which he has determined to make his god. (This, then, is the process:) after the
cross-shaped frame, the clay; after the clay, the god. In a well-understood routine, the cross
passes into a god through the clayey medium. The cross then you consecrate, and from it
the consecrated (deity) begins to derive his origin.668 By way of example, let us take the case
of a tree which grows up into a system of branches and foliage, and is a reproduction of its
own kind, whether it springs from the kernel of an olive, or the stone of a peach, or a grain
of pepper which has been duly tempered under ground. Now, if you transplant it, or take a
cutting off its branches for another plant, to what will you attribute what is produced by the
propagation? Will it not be to the grain, or the stone, or the kernel? Because, as the third
stage is attributable to the second, and the second in like manner to the first, so the third
will have to be referred to the first, through the second as the mean. We need not stay any
longer in the discussion of this point, since by a natural law every kind of produce
throughout nature refers back its growth to its original source; and just as the product is
comprised in its primal cause, so does that cause agree in character with the thing produced.
Since, then, in the production of your gods, you worship the cross which originates them,
here will be the original kernel and grain, from which are propagated the wooden materials
of your idolatrous images. Examples are not far to seek. Your victories you celebrate with
religious ceremony669 as deities; and they are the more august in proportion to the joy they
bring you. The frames on which you hang up your trophies must be crosses: these are, as it
were, the very core of your pageants.670 Thus, in your victories, the religion of your camp
makes even crosses objects of worship; your standards it adores, your standards are the
sanction of its oaths; your standards it prefers before Jupiter himself. But all that parade671
of images, and that display of pure gold, are (as so many) necklaces of the crosses. In like
manner also, in the banners and ensigns, which your soldiers guard with no less sacred care,

<p>Others, with greater regard to good manners, it must be confessed, suppose that the

east, or because we make Sunday a day of festivity. What then? Do you do less than this?
Do not many among you, with an affectation of sometimes worshipping the heavenly bodies
likewise, move your lips in the direction of the sunrise? It is you, at all events, who have
even admitted the sun into the calendar of the week; and you have selected its day,673 in
preference to the preceding day674 as the most suitable in the week675 for either an entire
abstinence from the bath, or for its postponement until the evening, or for taking rest and
for banqueting. By resorting to these customs, you deliberately deviate from your own religious
rites to those of strangers. For the Jewish feasts on the Sabbath and “the Purification,”676
and Jewish also are the ceremonies of the lamps,677 and the fasts of unleavened bread, and
the “littoral prayers,”678 all which institutions and practices are of course foreign from your
gods. Wherefore, that I may return from this digression, you who reproach us with the sun
and Sunday should consider your proximity to us. We are not far off from your Saturn and

<head>Chapter XIV.679—The Vile Calumny About Onocoetes Retorted on the Heathen by
Tertullian.</head>
<p>Report has introduced a new calumny respecting our God. Not so long ago, a most
abandoned wretch in that city of yours,680 a man who had deserted indeed his own religion—
a Jew, in fact, who had only lost his skin, flayed of course by wild beasts,681 against
which he enters the lists for hire day after day with a sound body, and so in a condition to
lose his skin682—carried about in public a caricature of us with this label: Onocoetes.683 This
(figure) had ass’s ears, and was dressed in a toga with a book, having a hoof on one of his
feet. And the crowd believed this infamous Jew. For what other set of men is the seed-plot684
of all the calumny against us? Throughout the city, therefore, Onocoetes is all the talk. As,
however, it is less then “a nine days’ wonder,”685 and so destitute of all authority from time,
and weak enough from the character of its author, I shall gratify myself by using it simply
in the way of a retort. Let us then see whether you are not here also found in our company.
Now it matters not what their form may be, when our concern is about deformed images.
You have amongst you gods with a dog’s head, and a lion’s head, with the horns of a cow,
and a ram, and a goat, goat-shaped or serpent-shaped, and winged in foot, head, and back.
Why therefore brand our one God so conspicuously? Many an Onocoetes is found amongst
yourselves.</p>

<head>Chapter XV.686—The Charge of Infanticide Retorted on the Heathen.</head>
<p>Since we are on a par in respect of the gods, it follows that there is no difference between
us on the point of sacrifice, or even of worship,687 if I may be allowed to make good our
comparison from another sort of evidence. We begin our religious service, or initiate our
mysteries, with slaying an infant. As for you, since your own transactions in human blood
and infanticide have faded from your memory, you shall be duly reminded of them in the
proper place; we now postpone most of the instances, that we may not seem to be everywhere688
handling the selfsame topics. Meanwhile, as I have said, the comparison between
us does not fail in another point of view. For if we are infanticides in one sense, you also
can hardly be deemed such in any other sense; because, although you are forbidden by the
laws to slay new-born infants, it so happens that no laws are evaded with more impunity or
greater safety, with the deliberate knowledge of the public, and the suffrages689 of this entire
age.690 Yet there is no great difference between us, only you do not kill your infants in the
way of a sacred rite, nor (as a service) to God. But then you make away with them in a more
cruel manner, because you expose them to the cold and hunger, and to wild beasts, or else
you get rid of them by the slower death of drowning. If, however, there does occur any dissimilarity
between us in this matter,691 you must not overlook the fact that it is your own
dear children692 whose life you quench; and this will supplement, nay, abundantly aggravate,
on your side of the question, whatever is defective in us on other grounds. Well, but we are
said to sup off our impious sacrifice! Whilst we postpone to a more suitable place693 whatever
resemblance even to this practice is discoverable amongst yourselves, we are not far removed
from you in voracity. If in the one case there is unchastity, and in ours cruelty, we are still
on the same footing (if I may so far admit our guilt694) in nature, where cruelty is always
found in concord with unchastity. But, after all, what do you less than we; or rather, what
do you not do in excess of us? I wonder whether it be a small matter to you695 to pant for
human entrails, because you devour full-grown men alive? Is it, forsooth, only a trifle to

Noble Roman Youth and His Parents.</head>
<p>I am now come to the hour for extinguishing the lamps, and for using the dogs, and
practising the deeds of darkness. And on this point I am afraid I must succumb to you; for
what similar accusation shall I have to bring against you? But you should at once commend
the cleverness with which we make our incest look modest, in that we have devised a
spurious night,699 to avoid polluting the real light and darkness, and have even thought it
right to dispense with earthly lights, and to play tricks also with our conscience. For whatever
we do ourselves, we suspect in others when we choose (to be suspicious). As for your incestuous
deeds, on the contrary,700 men enjoy them at full liberty, in the face of day, or in the
natural night, or before high Heaven; and in proportion to their successful issue is your own
ignorance of the result, since you publicly indulge in your incestuous intercourse in the full
cognizance of broad day-light. (No ignorance, however, conceals our conduct from our
eyes,) for in the very darkness we are able to recognise our own misdeeds. The Persians, you
know very well,701 according to Ctesias, live quite promiscuously with their mothers, in full
knowledge of the fact, and without any horror; whilst of the Macedonians it is well known
that they constantly do the same thing, and with perfect approbation: for once, when the
blinded702 OEdipus came upon their stage, they greeted him with laughter and derisive
cheers. The actor, taking off his mask in great alarm, said, “Gentlemen, have I displeased
you?” “Certainly not,” replied the Macedonians, “you have played your part well enough;
but either the author was very silly, if he invented (this mutilation as an atonement for the
incest), or else OEdipus was a great fool for his pains if he really so punished himself;” and
then they shouted out one to the other, ῝Ηλσυνε εἰς τὴν μητέρα. But how insignificant, (say
you,) is the stain which one or two nations can make on the whole world! As for us, we of
course have infected the very sun, polluted the entire ocean! Quote, then, one nation which
is free from the passions which allure the whole race of men to incest! If there is a single
nation which knows nothing of concubinage through the necessity of age and sex—to say
nothing of lust and licentiousness—that nation will be a stranger to incest. If any nature can
be found so peculiarly removed from the human state as to be liable neither to ignorance,
nor error, nor misfortune, that alone may be adduced with any consistency as an answer to
the Christians. Reflect, therefore, on the licentiousness which floats about amongst men’s

passions703 as if they were the winds, and consider whether there be any communities which
the full and strong tides of passion fail to waft to the commission of this great sin. In the
first place, when you expose your infants to the mercy of others, or leave them for adoption
to better parents than yourselves, do you forget what an opportunity for incest is furnished,
how wide a scope is opened for its accidental commission? Undoubtedly, such of you as are
more serious from a principle of self-restraint and careful reflection, abstain from lusts
which could produce results of such a kind, in whatever place you may happen to be, at
home or abroad, so that no indiscriminate diffusion of seed, or licentious reception thereof,
will produce children to you unawares, such as their very parents, or else other children,
might encounter in inadvertent incest, for no restraint from age is regarded in (the importunities
of) lust. All acts of adultery, all cases of fornication, all the licentiousness of public
brothels, whether committed at home or perpetrated out of doors,704 serve to produce
confusions of blood and complications of natural relationship,705 and thence to conduce
to incest; from which consummation your players and buffoons draw the materials of their
exhibitions. It was from such a source, too, that so flagrant a tragedy recently burst upon
the public as that which the prefect Fuscianus had judicially to decide. A boy of noble birth,
who, by the unintentional neglect of his attendants,706 had strolled too far from home, was
decoyed by some passers-by, and carried off. The paltry Greek707 who had the care of him,
or somebody else,708 in true Greek fashion, had gone into the house and captured him.
Having been taken away into Asia, he is brought, when arrived at full age, back to Rome,
and exposed for sale. His own father buys him unawares, and treats him as a Greek.709 Afterwards,
as was his wont, the youth is sent by his master into the fields, chained as a slave.710
Thither the tutor and the nurse had already been banished for punishment. The whole case
is represented to them; they relate each other’s misfortunes: they, on the one hand, how
they had lost their ward when he was a boy; he, on the other hand, that he had been lost
from his boyhood. But they agreed in the main, that he was a native of Rome of a noble
family; perhaps he further gave sure proofs of his identity. Accordingly, as God willed it
for the purpose of fastening a stain upon that age, a presentiment about the time excites
him, the periods exactly suit his age, even his eyes help to recall711 his features, some pecu-

Our first step in this contumacious conduct concerns that which is ranked by you immediately
after716 the worship due to God, that is, the worship due to the majesty of the Cæsars,
in respect of which we are charged with being irreligious towards them, since we neither
propitiate their images nor swear by their genius. We are called enemies of the people. Well,
be it so; yet at the same time (it must not be forgotten, that) the emperors find enemies
amongst you heathen, and are constantly getting surnames to signalize their triumphs—one
becoming Parthicus,717 and another Medicus and Germanicus.718 On this head719 the Roman

when you do not swear honestly729 even by your gods. Well, we do not call the emperor

<head>Chapter XVIII.732—Christians Charged with an Obstinate Contempt of Death. Instances
of the Same are Found Amongst the Heathen.</head>
<p>The rest of your charge of obstinacy against us you sum up in this indictment, that we
boldly refuse neither your swords, nor your crosses, nor your wild beasts, nor fire, nor tortures,
such is our obduracy and contempt of death. But (you are inconsistent in your charges);
for in former times amongst your own ancestors all these terrors have come in men’s intrepidity733
not only to be despised, but even to be held in great praise. How many swords there
were, and what brave men were willing to suffer by them, it were irksome to enumerate.734
(If we take the torture) of the cross, of which so many instances have occurred, exquisite in
cruelty, your own Regulus readily initiated the suffering which up to his day was without a
precedent;735 a queen of Egypt used wild beasts of her own (to accomplish her death);736
the Carthaginian woman, who in the last extremity of her country was more courageous
than her husband Asdrubal,737 only followed the example, set long before by Dido herself,
of going through fire to her death. Then, again, a woman of Athens defied the tyrant, exhausted
his tortures, and at last, lest her person and sex might succumb through weakness,
she bit off her tongue and spat out of her mouth the only possible instrument of a confession
which was now out of her power.738 But in your own instance you account such deeds
glorious, in ours obstinate. Annihilate now the glory of your ancestors, in order that you
may thereby annihilate us also. Be content from henceforth to repeal the praises of your
forefathers, in order that you may not have to accord commendation to us for the same
(sufferings). Perhaps (you will say) the character of a more robust age may have rendered
the spirits of antiquity more enduring. Now, however, (we enjoy) the blessing of quietness
and peace; so that the minds and dispositions of men (should be) more tolerant even towards
strangers. Well, you rejoin, be it so: you may compare yourselves with the ancients; we must
needs pursue with hatred all that we find in you offensive to ourselves, because it does not
obtain currency739 among us. Answer me, then, on each particular case by itself. I am not
seeking for examples on a uniform scale.740 Since, forsooth, the sword through their contempt

<p>Here end, I suppose, your tremendous charges of obstinacy against the Christians. Now,
since we are amenable to them in common with yourselves, it only remains that we compare
the grounds which the respective parties have for being personally derided. All our obstinacy,
however, is with you a foregone conclusion,751 based on our strong convictions; for we take
for granted752 a resurrection of the dead. Hope in this resurrection amounts to753 a contempt
of death. Ridicule, therefore, as much as you like the excessive stupidity of such minds as
die that they may live; but then, in order that you may be able to laugh more merrily, and
deride us with greater boldness, you must take your sponge, or perhaps your tongue, and
wipe away those records of yours every now and then cropping out,754 which assert in not
dissimilar terms that souls will return to bodies. But how much more worthy of acceptance
is our belief which maintains that they will return to the same bodies! And how much more
ridiculous is your inherited conceit,755 that the human spirit is to reappear in a dog, or a
mule, or a peacock! Again, we affirm that a judgment has been ordained by God according
to the merits of every man. This you ascribe to Minos and Rhadamanthus, while at the same
time you reject Aristides, who was a juster judge than either. By the award of the judgment,
we say that the wicked will have to spend an eternity in endless fire, the pious and innocent
in a region of bliss. In your view likewise an unalterable condition is ascribed to the respective
destinations of Pyriphlegethon756 and Elysium. Now they are not merely your composers
of myth and poetry who write songs of this strain; but your philosophers also speak with all
confidence of the return of souls to their former state,757 and of the twofold award758 of a
final judgment.</p>

to Examine and Embrace It.</head>
<p>How long therefore, O most unjust heathen, will you refuse to acknowledge us, and
(what is more) to execrate your own (worthies), since between us no distinction has place,
because we are one and the same? Since you do not (of course) hate what you yourselves
are, give us rather your right hands in fellowship, unite your salutations,759 mingle your
embraces, sanguinary with the sanguinary, incestuous with the incestuous, conspirators
with conspirators, obstinate and vain with those of the selfsame qualities. In company with
each other, we have been traitors to the majesty of the gods; and together do we provoke
their indignation. You too have your “third race;”760 not indeed third in the way of religious
rite,761 but a third race in sex, and, made up as it is of male and female in one, it is more
fitted to men and women (for offices of lust).762 Well, then, do we offend you by the very
fact of our approximation and agreement? Being on a par is apt to furnish unconsciously
the materials for rivalry. Thus “a potter envies a potter, and a smith a smith.”763 But we
must now discontinue this imaginary confession.764 Our conscience has returned to the
truth, and to the consistency of truth. For all those points which you allege765 (against us)
will be really found in ourselves alone; and we alone can rebut them, against whom they are
adduced, by getting you to listen766 to the other side of the question, whence that full
knowledge is learnt which both inspires counsel and directs the judgment. Now it is in fact
your own maxim, that no one should determine a cause without hearing both sides of it;
and it is only in our own case that you neglect (the equitable principle). You indulge to the
full767 that fault of human nature, that those things which you do not disallow in yourselves

you will choose to occupy yourselves is different from ours: whilst chaste in the eyes of
others, you are unchaste towards your own selves; whilst vigorous against vice out of doors,
you succumb to it at home. This is the injustice (which we have to suffer), that, knowing
truth, we are condemned by those who know it not; free from guilt, we are judged by those
who are implicated in it. Remove the mote, or rather the beam, out of your own eye, that
you may be able to extract the mote from the eyes of others. Amend your own lives first,
that you may be able to punish the Christians. Only so far as you shall have effected your
own reformation, will you refuse to inflict punishment on them—nay, so far will you have
become Christians yourselves; and as you shall have become Christians, so far will you have
compassed your own amendment of life. Learn what that is which you accuse in us, and
you will accuse no longer; search out what that is which you do not accuse in yourselves,
and you will become self-accusers. From these very few and humble remarks, so far as we
have been able to open out the subject to you, you will plainly get some insight into (your
own) error, and some discovery of our truth. Condemn that truth if you have the heart,771
but only after you have examined it; and approve the error still, if you are so minded,772
only first explore it. But if your prescribed rule is to love error and hate truth, why, (let me

<head>Chapter I.—The Heathen Gods from Heathen Authorities. Varro Has Written a
Work on the Subject. His Threefold Classification. The Changeable Character
of that Which Ought to Be Fixed and Certain.</head>
<p>Our defence requires that we should at this point discuss with you the character of your
gods, O ye heathen, fit objects of our pity,774 appealing even to your own conscience to determine
whether they be truly gods, as you would have it supposed, or falsely, as you are
unwilling to have proved.775 Now this is the material part of human error, owing to the
wiles of its author, that it is never free from the ignorance of error,776 whence your guilt is
all the greater. Your eyes are open, yet they see not; your ears are unstopped, yet they hear
not; though your heart beats, it is yet dull, nor does your mind understand777 that of which
it is cognizant.778 If indeed the enormous perverseness (of your worship) could779 be broken
up780 by a single demurrer, we should have our objection ready to hand in the declaration781
that, as we know all those gods of yours to have been instituted by men, all belief in the true
Deity is by this very circumstance brought to nought;782 because, of course, nothing which
some time or other had a beginning can rightly seem to be divine. But the fact is,783 there
are many things by which tenderness of conscience is hardened into the callousness of wilful
error. Truth is beleaguered with the vast force (of the enemy), and yet how secure she is in
her own inherent strength! And naturally enough784 when from her very adversaries she
gains to her side whomsoever she will, as her friends and protectors, and prostrates the entire
host of her assailants. It is therefore against these things that our contest lies—against the
institutions of our ancestors, against the authority of tradition,785 the laws of our governors,

and the reasonings of the wise; against antiquity, custom, submission;786 against precedents,
prodigies, miracles,—all which things have had their part in consolidating that spurious787
system of your gods. Wishing, then, to follow step by step your own commentaries which
you have drawn out of your theology of every sort (because the authority of learned men
goes further with you in matters of this kind than the testimony of facts), I have taken and
abridged the works of Varro;788 for he in his treatise Concerning Divine Things, collected
out of ancient digests, has shown himself a serviceable guide789 for us. Now, if I inquire of
him who were the subtle inventors790 of the gods, he points to either the philosophers, the
peoples, or the poets. For he has made a threefold distinction in classifying the gods: one
being the physical class, of which the philosophers treat; another the mythic class, which is
the constant burden of791 the poets; the third, the gentile class, which the nations have adopted
each one for itself. When, therefore, the philosophers have ingeniously composed
their physical (theology) out of their own conjectures, when the poets have drawn their
mythical from fables, and the (several) nations have forged their gentile (polytheism) according
to their own will, where in the world must truth be placed? In the conjectures? Well,
but these are only a doubtful conception. In the fables? But they are at best an absurd story.
In the popular accounts?792 This sort of opinion,793 however, is only promiscuous794 and
municipal. Now all things with the philosophers are uncertain, because of their variation
with the poets all is worthless, because immoral; with the nations all is irregular and confused,
because dependent on their mere choice. The nature of God, however, if it be the true one
with which you are concerned, is of so definite a character as not to be derived from uncertain
speculations,795 nor contaminated with worthless fables, nor determined by promiscuous
conceits. It ought indeed to be regarded, as it really is, as certain, entire, universal, because
it is in truth the property of all. Now, what god shall I believe? One that has been gauged by
vague suspicion? One that history796 has divulged? One that a community has invented? It

<head>Chapter II.—Philosophers Had Not Succeeded in Discovering God. The Uncertainty
and Confusion of Their Speculations.</head>
<p>But the authority of the physical philosophers is maintained among you798 as the special
property799 of wisdom. You mean of course, that pure and simple wisdom of the philosophers
which attests its own weakness mainly by that variety of opinion which proceeds from an
ignorance of the truth. Now what wise man is so devoid of truth, as not to know that God
is the Father and Lord of wisdom itself and truth? Besides, there is that divine oracle uttered
by Solomon: “The fear of the Lord,” says he, “is the beginning of wisdom.”800 But801 fear
has its origin in knowledge; for how will a man fear that of which he knows nothing?
Therefore he who shall have the fear of God, even if he be ignorant of all things else, if he
has attained to the knowledge and truth of God,802 will possess full and perfect wisdom.
This, however, is what philosophy has not clearly realized. For although, in their inquisitive
disposition to search into all kinds of learning, the philosophers may seem to have investigated
the sacred Scriptures themselves for their antiquity, and to have derived thence some of
their opinions; yet because they have interpolated these deductions they prove that they have
either despised them wholly or have not fully believed them, for in other cases also the
simplicity of truth is shaken803 by the over-scrupulousness of an irregular belief,804 and
that they therefore changed them, as their desire of glory grew, into products of their own
mind. The consequence of this is, that even that which they had discovered degenerated
into uncertainty, and there arose from one or two drops of truth a perfect flood of argumentation.
For after they had simply805 found God, they did not expound Him as they found
Him, but rather disputed about His quality, and His nature, and even about His abode. The
Platonists, indeed, (held) Him to care about worldly things, both as the disposer and judge
thereof. The Epicureans regarded Him as apathetic806 and inert, and (so to say) a non-entity.
807 The Stoics believed Him to be outside of the world; the Platonists, within the world.
The God whom they had so imperfectly admitted, they could neither know nor fear; and

therefore they could not be wise, since they wandered away indeed from the beginning of
wisdom,” that is, “the fear of God.” Proofs are not wanting that among the philosophers
there was not only an ignorance, but actual doubt, about the divinity. Diogenes, when asked
what was taking place in heaven, answered by saying, “I have never been up there.” Again,
whether there were any gods, he replied, “I do not know; only there ought to be gods.”808
When Croesus inquired of Thales of Miletus what he thought of the gods, the latter having
taken some time809 to consider, answered by the word “Nothing.” Even Socrates denied
with an air of certainty810 those gods of yours.811 Yet he with a like certainty requested that
a cock should be sacrificed to Æsculapius. And therefore when philosophy, in its practice
of defining about God, is detected in such uncertainty and inconsistency, what “fear” could
it possibly have had of Him whom it was not competent812 clearly to determine? We have
been taught to believe of the world that it is god.813 For such the physical class of theologizers
conclude it to be, since they have handed down such views about the gods that Dionysius
the Stoic divides them into three kinds. The first, he supposes, includes those gods which
are most obvious, as the Sun, Moon, and Stars; the next, those which are not apparent, as
Neptune; the remaining one, those which are said to have passed from the human state to
the divine, as Hercules and Amphiaraus. In like manner, Arcesilaus makes a threefold form
of the divinity—the Olympian, the Astral, the Titanian—sprung from Coelus and Terra;
from which through Saturn and Ops came Neptune, Jupiter, and Orcus, and their entire
progeny. Xenocrates, of the Academy, makes a twofold division—the Olympian and the
Titanian, which descend from Coelus and Terra. Most of the Egyptians believe that there
are four gods—the Sun and the Moon, the Heaven and the Earth. Along with all the supernal
fire Democritus conjectures that the gods arose. Zeno, too, will have it that their nature resembles
it. Whence Varro also makes fire to be the soul of the world, that in the world fire
governs all things, just as the soul does in ourselves. But all this is most absurd. For he says,
Whilst it is in us, we have existence; but as soon as it has left us, we die. Therefore, when
fire quits the world in lightning, the world comes to its end.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—The Physical Philosophers Maintained the Divinity of the Elements;
The Absurdity of the Tenet Exposed.</head>
<p>From these developments of opinion, we see that your814 physical class of philosophers
are driven to the necessity of contending that the elements are gods, since it alleges that
other gods are sprung from them; for it is only from gods that gods could be born. Now,
although we shall have to examine these other gods more fully in the proper place, in the
mythic section of the poets, yet, inasmuch as we must meanwhile treat of them in their
connection with the present class,815 we shall probably even from their present class,816
when once we turn to the gods themselves, succeed in showing that they can by no means
appear to be gods who are said to be sprung from the elements; so that we have at once a
presumption817 that the elements are not gods, since they which are born of the elements
are not gods. In like manner, whilst we show that the elements are not gods, we shall, according
to the law of natural relationship,818 get a presumptive argument that they cannot rightly
be maintained to be gods whose parents (in this case the elements) are not gods. It is a settled
point819 that a god is born of a god, and that what lacks divinity820 is born of what is not
divine. Now, so far as821 the world of which your philosophers treat822 (for I apply this term
to the universe in the most comprehensive sense823) contains the elements, ministering to
them as its component parts (for whatever its own condition may be, the same of course
will be that of its elements and constituent portions), it must needs have been formed either
by some being, according to the enlightened view824 of Plato, or else by none, according to
the harsh opinion825 of Epicurus; and since it was formed, by having a beginning, it must
also have an end. That, therefore, which at one time before its beginning had no existence,
and will by and by after its end cease to have an existence, cannot of course, by any possibility,
seem to be a god, wanting as it does that essential character of divinity, eternity, which

which they hold to be gods, when the Stoics deny that anything can be born of a god? Likewise,
how is it that they wish those beings, whom they suppose to be born of the elements,
to be regarded as gods, when they deny that a god can be born? Now, what must hold good
of the universe828 will have to be predicated of the elements, I mean of heaven, and of earth,
and of the stars, and of fire, which Varro has vainly proposed that you should believe829 to
be gods, and the parents of gods, contrary to that generation and nativity which he had de-
clared to be impossible in a god. Now this same Varro had shown that the earth and the
stars were animated.830 But if this be the case, they must needs be also mortal, according to
the condition831 of animated nature; for although the soul is evidently immortal, this attribute
is limited to it alone: it is not extended to that with which it is associated, that is, the body.
Nobody, however, will deny that the elements have body, since we both touch them and are
touched by them, and we see certain bodies fall down from them. If, therefore, they are animated,
laying aside the principle832 of a soul, as befits their condition as bodies, they are
mortal—of course not immortal. And yet whence is it that the elements appear to Varro to
be animated? Because, forsooth, the elements have motion. And then, in order to anticipate
what may be objected on the other side, that many things else have motion—as wheels, as
carriages, as several other machines—he volunteers the statement that he believes only such
things to be animated as move of themselves, without any apparent mover or impeller from
without, like the apparent mover of the wheel, or propeller of the carriage, or director of
the machine. If, then, they are not animated, they have no motion of themselves. Now, when
he thus alleges a power which is not apparent, he points to what it was his duty to seek after,
even the creator and controller of the motion; for it does not at once follow that, because
we do not see a thing, we believe that it does not exist. Rather, it is necessary the more profoundly
to investigate what one does not see, in order the better to understand the character
of that which is apparent. Besides if (you admit) only the existence of those things which
appear and are supposed to exist simply because they appear, how is it that you also admit
them to be gods which do not appear? If, moreover, those things seem to have existence

which have none, why may they not have existence also which do not seem to have it? Such,
for instance, as the Mover833 of the heavenly beings. Granted, then, that things are animated
because they move of themselves, and that they move of themselves when they are not moved
by another: still it does not follow that they must straightway be gods, because they are animated,
nor even because they move of themselves; else what is to prevent all animals
whatever being accounted gods, moving as they do of themselves? This, to be sure, is allowed
to the Egyptians, but their superstitious vanity has another basis.834</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Wrong Derivation of the Word Θεός. The Name Indicative of the
True Deity. God Without Shape and Immaterial. Anecdote of Thales.</head>
<p>Some affirm that the gods (i.e. θεοί) were so called because the verbs θέειν and σείσθαι
signify to run and to be moved.835 This term, then, is not indicative of any majesty, for it is
derived from running and motion, not from any dominion836 of godhead. But inasmuch
as the Supreme God whom we worship is also designated Θεός, without however the appearance
of any course or motion in Him, because He is not visible to any one, it is clear that
that word must have had some other derivation, and that the property of divinity, innate
in Himself, must have been discovered. Dismissing, then, that ingenious interpretation, it
is more likely that the gods were not called θεοί from running and motion, but that the term
was borrowed from the designation of the true God; so that you gave the name θεοί to the
gods, whom you had in like manner forged for yourselves. Now, that this is the case, a plain
proof is afforded in the fact that you actually give the common appellation θεοί to all those
gods of yours, in whom there is no attribute of course or motion indicated. When, therefore,
you call them both θεοί and immoveable with equal readiness, there is a deviation as well
from the meaning of the word as from the idea837 of godhead, which is set aside838 if
measured by the notion of course and motion. But if that sacred name be peculiarly significant
of deity, and be simply true and not of a forced interpretation839 in the case of the true God,
but transferred in a borrowed sense840 to those other objects which you choose to call gods,
then you ought to show to us841 that there is also a community of character between them,
so that their common designation may rightly depend on their union of essence. But the
true God, on the sole ground that He is not an object of sense, is incapable of being compared
with those false deities which are cognizable to sight and sense (to sense indeed is sufficient);
for this amounts to a clear statement of the difference between an obscure proof and a
manifest one. Now, since the elements are obvious to all, (and) since God, on the contrary,
<note type="footnote">835 This seems to mean: “because θέειν has also the sense of σείεσθαι (motion as well as progression).”</note>

is visible to none, how will it be in your power from that part which you have not seen to
pass to a decision on the objects which you see? Since, therefore, you have not to combine
them in your perception or your reason, why do you combine them in name with the purpose
of combining them also in power? For see how even Zeno separates the matter of the world
from God: he says that the latter has percolated through the former, like honey through the
comb. God, therefore, and Matter are two words (and) two things. Proportioned to the
difference of the words is the diversity of the things; the condition also of matter follows its
designation. Now if matter is not God, because its very appellation teaches us so, how can
those things which are inherent in matter—that is, the elements—be regarded as gods, since
the component members cannot possibly be heterogeneous from the body? But what concern
have I with physiological conceits? It were better for one’s mind to ascend above the state
of the world, not to stoop down to uncertain speculations. Plato’s form for the world was
round. Its square, angular shape, such as others had conceived it to be, he rounded off, I
suppose, with compasses, from his labouring to have it believed to be simply without a beginning.
842 Epicurus, however, who had said, “What is above us is nothing to us,” wished
notwithstanding to have a peep at the sky, and found the sun to be a foot in diameter. Thus
far you must confess843 men were niggardly in even celestial objects. In process of time
their ambitious conceptions advanced, and so the sun too enlarged its disk.844 Accordingly,
the Peripatetics marked it out as a larger world.845 Now, pray tell me, what wisdom is there
in this hankering after conjectural speculations? What proof is afforded to us, notwithstanding
the strong confidence of its assertions, by the useless affectation of a scrupulous curiosity,
846 which is tricked out with an artful show of language? It therefore served Thales of
Miletus quite right, when, star-gazing as he walked with all the eyes he had, he had the
mortification of falling847 into a well, and was unmercifully twitted by an Egyptian, who
said to him, “Is it because you found nothing on earth to look at, that you think you ought
to confine your gaze to the sky?” His fall, therefore, is a figurative picture of the philosophers;
of those, I mean,848 who persist in applying849 their studies to a vain purpose, since they
indulge a stupid curiosity on natural objects, which they ought rather (intelligently to direct)
to their Creator and Governor.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—The Physical Theory Continued. Further Reasons Advanced Against
the Divinity of the Elements.</head>
<p>Why, then, do we not resort to that far more reasonable850 opinion, which has clear
proof of being derived from men’s common sense and unsophisticated deduction?851 Even
Varro bears it in mind, when he says that the elements are supposed to be divine, because
nothing whatever is capable, without their concurrence,852 of being produced, nourished,
or applied to the sustenance853 of man’s life and of the earth, since not even our bodies and
souls could have sufficed in themselves without the modification854 of the elements. By this
it is that the world is made generally habitable,—a result which is harmoniously secured855
by the distribution into zones,856 except where human residence has been rendered impracticable
by intensity of cold or heat. On this account, men have accounted as gods—the sun,
because it imparts from itself the light of day, ripens the fruit with its warmth, and measures
the year with its stated periods; the moon, which is at once the solace of the night and the
controller of the months by its governance; the stars also, certain indications as they are of
those seasons which are to be observed in the tillage of our fields; lastly, the very heaven
also under which, and the earth over which, as well as the intermediate space within which,
all things conspire together for the good of man. Nor is it from their beneficent influences
only that a faith in their divinity has been deemed compatible with the elements, but from
their opposite qualities also, such as usually happen from what one might call857 their wrath
and anger—as thunder, and hail, and drought, and pestilential winds, floods also, and
openings of the ground, and earthquakes: these are all fairly enough858 accounted gods,
whether their nature becomes the object of reverence as being favourable, or of fear because
terrible—the sovereign dispenser,859 in fact,860 both of help and of hurt. But in the practical

conduct of social life, this is the way in which men act and feel: they do not show gratitude
or find fault with the very things from which the succour or the injury proceeds, so much
as with them by whose strength and power the operation of the things is effected. For even
in your amusements you do not award the crown as a prize to the flute or the harp, but to
the musician who manages the said flute or harp by the power of his delightful skill.861 In
like manner, when one is in ill-health, you do not bestow your acknowledgments on the
flannel wraps,862 or the medicines, or the poultices, but on the doctors by whose care and
prudence the remedies become effectual. So again, in untoward events, they who are
wounded with the sword do not charge the injury on the sword or the spear, but on the
enemy or the robber; whilst those whom a falling house covers do not blame the tiles or the
stones, but the oldness of the building; as again shipwrecked sailors impute their calamity
not to the rocks and waves, but to the tempest. And rightly too; for it is certain that everything
which happens must be ascribed not to the instrument with which, but to the agent by
whom, it takes place; inasmuch as he is the prime cause of the occurrence,863 who appoints
both the event itself and that by whose instrumentality it comes to pass (as there are in all
things these three particular elements—the fact itself, its instrument, and its cause), because
he himself who wills the occurrence of a thing comes into notice864 prior to the thing which
he wills, or the instrument by which it occurs. On all other occasions therefore, your conduct
is right enough, because you consider the author; but in physical phenomena your rule is
opposed to that natural principle which prompts you to a wise judgment in all other cases,
removing out of sight as you do the supreme position of the author, and considering rather
the things that happen, than him by whom they happen. Thus it comes to pass that you
suppose the power and the dominion to belong to the elements, which are but the slaves
and functionaries. Now do we not, in thus tracing out an artificer and master within, expose
the artful structure of their slavery865 out of the appointed functions of those elements to
which you ascribe (the attributes) of power?866 But gods are not slaves; therefore whatever
things are servile in character are not gods. Otherwise867 they should prove to us that, according
to the ordinary course of things, liberty is promoted by irregular licence,868 despotism

the entire management of the world871 is obedient, reaching even to the utility and injury
of the human race? For you cannot pretend that these (phenomena) act and care for themselves

<head>Chapter VI.—The Changes of the Heavenly Bodies, Proof that They are Not Divine.
Transition from the Physical to the Mythic Class of Gods.</head>
<p>Come now, do you allow that the Divine Being not only has nothing servile in His
course, but exists in unimpaired integrity, and ought not to be diminished, or suspended,
or destroyed? Well, then, all His blessedness872 would disappear, if He were ever subject to
change. Look, however, at the stellar bodies; they both undergo change, and give clear
evidence of the fact. The moon tells us how great has been its loss, as it recovers its full
form;873 its greater losses you are already accustomed to measure in a mirror of water;874
so that I need not any longer believe in any wise what magians have asserted. The sun, too,
is frequently put to the trial of an eclipse. Explain as best you may the modes of these celes-
tial casualties, it is impossible875 for God either to become less or to cease to exist. Vain,
therefore, are876 those supports of human learning, which, by their artful method of weaving
conjectures, belie both wisdom and truth. Besides,877 it so happens, indeed, according to
your natural way of thinking, that he who has spoken the best is supposed to have spoken
most truly, instead of him who has spoken the truth being held to have spoken the best.
Now the man who shall carefully look into things, will surely allow it to be a greater probability
that those878 elements which we have been discussing are under some rule and direction,
than that they have a motion of their own, and that being under government they cannot
be gods. If, however, one is in error in this matter, it is better to err simply than speculatively,
like your physical philosophers. But, at the same time,879 if you consider the character of
the mythic school, (and compare it with the physical,) the error which we have already seen
frail men880 making in the latter is really the more respectable one, since it ascribes a divine
nature to those things which it supposes to be superhuman in their sensibility, whether in
respect of their position, their power, their magnitude, or their divinity. For that which you
suppose to be higher than man, you believe to be very near to God.</p>

Such Matters. Homer and the Mythic Poets. Why Irreligious.</head>
<p>But to pass to the mythic class of gods, which we attributed to the poets,881 I hardly
know whether I must only seek to put them on a par with our own human mediocrity, or
whether they must be affirmed to be gods, with proofs of divinity, like the African Mopsus
and the Boeotian Amphiaraus. I must now indeed but slightly touch on this class, of which
a fuller view will be taken in the proper place.882 Meanwhile, that these were only human
beings, is clear from the fact that you do not consistently call them gods, but heroes. Why
then discuss the point? Although divine honours had to be ascribed to dead men, it was not
to them as such, of course. Look at your own practice, when with similar excess of presumption
you sully heaven with the sepulchres of your kings: is it not such as are illustrious for
justice, virtue, piety, and every excellence of this sort, that you honour with the blessedness
of deification, contented even to incur contempt if you forswear yourselves883 for such
characters? And, on the other hand, do you not deprive the impious and disgraceful of even
the old prizes of human glory, tear up884 their decrees and titles, pull down their statues,
and deface885 their images on the current coin? Will He, however, who beholds all things,
who approves, nay, rewards the good, prostitute before all men886 the attribute of His own
inexhaustible grace and mercy? And shall men be allowed an especial mount of care and
righteousness, that they may be wise887 in selecting and multiplying888 their deities? Shall
attendants on kings and princes be more pure than those who wait on the Supreme God?889
You turn your back in horror, indeed, on outcasts and exiles, on the poor and weak, on the
obscurely born and the low-lived;890 but yet you honour, even by legal sanctions,891 unchaste
men, adulterers, robbers, and parricides. Must we regard it as a subject of ridicule or indignation,
that such characters are believed to be gods who are not fit to be men? Then, again,

in this mythic class of yours which the poets celebrate, how uncertain is your conduct as to
purity of conscience and the maintenance thereof! For whenever we hold up to execration
the wretched, disgraceful and atrocious (examples) of your gods, you defend them as mere
fables, on the pretence of poetic licence; whenever we volunteer a silent contempt892 of this
said893 poetic licence, then you are not only troubled with no horror of it, but you go so far
as894 to show it respect, and to hold it as one of the indispensable (fine) arts; nay,895 you
carry out the studies of your higher classes896 by its means, as the very foundation897 of
your literature. Plato was of opinion that poets ought to be banished, as calumniators of the
gods; (he would even have) Homer himself expelled from his republic, although, as you are
aware,898 he was the crowned head of them all. But while you admit and retain them thus,
why should you not believe them when they disclose such things respecting your gods? And
if you do believe your poets, how is it that you worship such gods (as they describe)? If you
worship them simply because you do not believe the poets, why do you bestow praise on
such lying authors, without any fear of giving offence to those whose calumniators you
honour? A regard for truth899 is not, of course, to be expected of poets. But when you say
that they only make men into gods after their death, do you not admit that before death the
said gods were merely human? Now what is there strange in the fact, that they who were
once men are subject to the dishonour900 of human casualties, or crimes, or fables? Do you
not, in fact, put faith in your poets, when it is in accordance with their rhapsodies901 that
you have arranged in some instances your very rituals? How is it that the priestess of Ceres
is ravished, if it is not because Ceres suffered a similar outrage? Why are the children of
others sacrificed to Saturn,902 if it is not because he spared not his own? Why is a male
mutilated in honour of the Idæan goddess Cybele, unless it be that the (unhappy) youth
who was too disdainful of her advances was castrated, owing to her vexation at his daring
to cross her love?903 Why was not Hercules “a dainty dish” to the good ladies of Lanuvium,

A Good Deal of This Perverse Theology Taken from Scripture. Serapis

<p>There remains the gentile class of gods amongst the several nations:906 these were adopted
out of mere caprice, not from the knowledge of the truth; and our information about them
comes from the private notions of different races. God, I imagine, is everywhere known,
everywhere present, powerful everywhere—an object whom all ought to worship, all ought
to serve. Since, then, it happens that even they, whom all the world worships in common,
fail in the evidence of their true divinity, how much more must this befall those whom their
very votaries907 have not succeeded in discovering! For what useful authority could possibly
precede a theology of so defective a character as to be wholly unknown to fame? How many
have either seen or heard of the Syrian Atargatis, the African Coelestis, the Moorish Varsutina,
the Arabian Obodas and Dusaris, or the Norican Belenus, or those whom Varro mentions—
Deluentinus of Casinum, Visidianus of Narnia, Numiternus of Atina, or Ancharia
of Asculum? And who have any clear notions908 of Nortia of Vulsinii?909 There is no difference
in the worth of even their names, apart from the human surnames which distinguish
them. I laugh often enough at the little coteries of gods910 in each municipality, which have
their honours confined within their own city walls. To what lengths this licence of adopting
gods has been pushed, the superstitious practices of the Egyptians show us; for they worship
even their native911 animals, such as cats, crocodiles, and their snake. It is therefore a small
matter that they have also deified a man—him, I mean, whom not Egypt only, or Greece,
but the whole world worships, and the Africans swear by; about whose state also all that
helps our conjectures and imparts to our knowledge the semblance of truth is stated in our
own (sacred) literature. For that Serapis of yours was originally one of our own saints called

sold into Egypt, and became a slave in the family of Pharaoh king of the country.913 Importuned
by the unchaste queen, when he refused to comply with her desire, she turned upon
him and reported him to the king, by whom he is put into prison. There he displays the
power of his divine inspiration, by interpreting aright the dreams of some (fellow-prisoners).
Meanwhile the king, too, has some terrible dreams. Joseph being brought before him, according
to his summons, was able to expound them. Having narrated the proofs of true
interpretation which he had given in the prison, he opens out his dream to the king: those
seven fat-fleshed and well-favoured kine signified as many years of plenty; in like manner,
the seven lean-fleshed animals predicted the scarcity of the seven following years. He accordingly
recommends precautions to be taken against the future famine from the previous
plenty. The king believed him. The issue of all that happened showed how wise he was, how
invariably holy, and now how necessary. So Pharaoh set him over all Egypt, that he might
secure the provision of corn for it, and thenceforth administer its government. They called
him Serapis, from the turban914 which adorned his head. The peck-like915 shape of this
turban marks the memory of his corn-provisioning; whilst evidence is given that the care
of the supplies was all on his head,916 by the very ears of corn which embellish the border
of the head-dress. For the same reason, also, they made the sacred figure of a dog,917 which
they regard (as a sentry) in Hades, and put it under his right hand, because the care of the
Egyptians was concentrated918 under his hand. And they put at his side Pharia,919 whose
name shows her to have been the king’s daughter. For in addition to all the rest of his kind
gifts and rewards, Pharaoh had given him his own daughter in marriage. Since, however,
they had begun to worship both wild animals and human beings, they combined both figures
under one form Anubis, in which there may rather be seen clear proofs of its own character
and condition enshrined920 by a nation at war with itself, refractory921 to its kings, despised
among foreigners, with even the appetite of a slave and the filthy nature of a dog.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—The Power of Rome. Romanized Aspect of All the Heathen Mythology.
Varro’s Threefold Distribution Criticised. Roman Heroes (Æneas Included,)
Unfavourably Reviewed.</head>
<p>Such are the more obvious or more remarkable points which we had to mention in
connection with Varro’s threefold distribution of the gods, in order that a sufficient answer
might seem to be given touching the physical, the poetic, and the gentile classes. Since,
however, it is no longer to the philosophers, nor the poets, nor the nations that we owe the
substitution of all (heathen worship for the true religion) although they transmitted the superstition,
but to the dominant Romans, who received the tradition and gave it wide authority,
another phase of the widespread error of man must now be encountered by us; nay,
another forest must be felled by our axe, which has obscured the childhood of the degenerate
worship922 with germs of superstitions gathered from all quarters. Well, but even the gods
of the Romans have received from (the same) Varro a threefold classification into the certain,
the uncertain, and the select. What absurdity! What need had they of uncertain gods, when
they possessed certain ones? Unless, forsooth, they wished to commit themselves to923 such
folly as the Athenians did; for at Athens there was an altar with this inscription: “To the
unknown gods.”924 Does, then, a man worship that which he knows nothing of? Then,
again, as they had certain gods, they ought to have been contented with them, without requiring
select ones. In this want they are even found to be irreligious! For if gods are selected
as onions are,925 then such as are not chosen are declared to be worthless. Now we on our
part allow that the Romans had two sets of gods, common and proper; in other words, those
which they had in common with other nations, and those which they themselves devised.
And were not these called the public and the foreign926 gods? Their altars tell us so; there is
(a specimen) of the foreign gods at the fane of Carna, of the public gods in the Palatium.
Now, since their common gods are comprehended in both the physical and the mythic
classes, we have already said enough concerning them. I should like to speak of their particular
kinds of deity. We ought then to admire the Romans for that third set of the gods of
their enemies,927 because no other nation ever discovered for itself so large a mass of superstition.
Their other deities we arrange in two classes: those which have become gods from

human beings, and those which have had their origin in some other way. Now, since there
is advanced the same colourable pretext for the deification of the dead, that their lives were
meritorious, we are compelled to urge the same reply against them, that no one of them was
worth so much pains. Their fond928 father Æneas, in whom they believed, was never glorious,
and was felled with a stone929—a vulgar weapon, to pelt a dog withal, inflicting a wound
no less ignoble! But this Æneas turns out930 a traitor to his country; yes, quite as much as
Antenor. And if they will not believe this to be true of him, he at any rate deserted his
companions when his country was in flames, and must be held inferior to that woman of
Carthage,931 who, when her husband Hasdrubal supplicated the enemy with the mild
pusillanimity of our Æneas, refused to accompany him, but hurrying her children along
with her, disdained to take her beautiful self and father’s noble heart932 into exile, but
plunged into the flames of the burning Carthage, as if rushing into the embraces of her (dear
but) ruined country. Is he “pious Æneas” for (rescuing) his young only son and decrepit
old father, but deserting Priam and Astyanax? But the Romans ought rather to detest him;
for in defence of their princes and their royal933 house, they surrender934 even children and
wives, and every dearest pledge.935 They deify the son of Venus, and this with the full
knowledge and consent of her husband Vulcan, and without opposition from even Juno.
Now, if sons have seats in heaven owing to their piety to their parents, why are not those
noble youths936 of Argos rather accounted gods, because they, to save their mother from
guilt in the performance of some sacred rites, with a devotion more than human, yoked
themselves to her car and dragged her to the temple? Why not make a goddess, for her exceeding
piety, of that daughter937 who from her own breasts nourished her father who was
famishing in prison? What other glorious achievement can be related of Æneas, but that he
was nowhere seen in the fight on the field of Laurentum? Following his bent, perhaps he
fled a second time as a fugitive from the battle.938 In like manner, Romulus posthumously

built cities, counting even939 women? To be sure, Romulus slew his brother in the bargain,
and trickishly ravished some foreign virgins. Therefore of course he becomes a god, and
therefore a Quirinus (“god of the spear”), because then their fathers had to use the spear940
on his account. What did Sterculus do to merit deification? If he worked hard to enrich the
fields stercoribus,941 (with manure,) Augias had more dung than he to bestow on them. If
Faunus, the son of Picus, used to do violence to law and right, because struck with madness,
it was more fit that he should be doctored than deified.942 If the daughter of Faunus so excelled
in chastity, that she would hold no conversation with men, it was perhaps from
rudeness, or a consciousness of deformity, or shame for her father’s insanity. How much
worthier of divine honour than this “good goddess”943 was Penelope, who, although
dwelling among so many suitors of the vilest character, preserved with delicate tact the
purity which they assailed! There is Sanctus, too,944 who for his hospitality had a temple

<head>Chapter X.—A Disgraceful Feature of the Roman Mythology. It Honours Such Infamous
Characters as Larentina.</head>
<p>I hasten to even more abominable cases. Your writers have not been ashamed to publish
that of Larentina. She was a hired prostitute, whether as the nurse of Romulus, and therefore
called Lupa, because she was a prostitute, or as the mistress of Hercules, now deceased, that
is to say, now deified. They945 relate that his temple-warder946 happened to be playing at
dice in the temple alone; and in order to represent a partner for himself in the game, in the
absence of an actual one, he began to play with one hand for Hercules and the other for
himself. (The condition was,) that if he won the stakes from Hercules, he should with them
procure a supper and a prostitute; if Hercules, however, proved the winner, I mean his
other hand, then he should provide the same for Hercules. The hand of Hercules won. That
achievement might well have been added to his twelve labours! The temple-warden buys
a supper for the hero, and hires Larentina to play the whore. The fire which dissolved the
body of even a Hercules947 enjoyed the supper, and the altar consumed everything. Larentina
sleeps alone in the temple; and she a woman from the brothel, boasts that in her dreams she
had submitted herself to the pleasure of Hercules;948 and she might possibly have experienced
this, as it passed through her mind, in her sleep. In the morning, on going out of the temple
very early, she is solicited by a young man—“a third Hercules,” so to speak.949 He invites
her home. She complies, remembering that Hercules had told her that it would be for her
advantage. He then, to be sure, obtains permission that they should be united in lawful
wedlock (for none was allowed to have intercourse with the concubine of a god without
being punished for it); the husband makes her his heir. By and by, just before her death, she
bequeathed to the Roman people the rather large estate which she had obtained through
Hercules. After this she sought deification for her daughters too, whom indeed the divine
Larentina ought to have appointed her heirs also. The gods of the Romans received an accession
in her dignity. For she alone of all the wives of Hercules was dear to him, because
she alone was rich; and she was even far more fortunate than Ceres, who contributed to the
pleasure of the (king of the) dead.950 After so many examples and eminent names among
you, who might not have been declared divine? Who, in fact, ever raised a question as to

<head>Chapter XI.—The Romans Provided Gods for Birth, Nay, Even Before Birth, to
Death. Much Indelicacy in This System.</head>
<p>And you are not content to assert the divinity of such as were once known to you, whom
you heard and handled, and whose portraits have been painted, and actions recounted, and
memory retained amongst you; but men insist upon consecrating with a heavenly life953 I
know not what incorporeal, inanimate shadows, and the mere names of things—dividing
man’s entire existence amongst separate powers even from his conception in the womb: so
that there is a god Consevius,954 to preside over concubital generation; and Fluviona,955 to
preserve the (growth of the) infant in the womb; after these come Vitumnus and Sentinus,956
through whom the babe begins to have life and its earliest sensation; then Diespiter,957 by
whose office the child accomplishes its birth. But when women begin their parturition,
Candelifera also comes in aid, since childbearing requires the light of the candle; and other
goddesses there are958 who get their names from the parts they bear in the stages of travail.
There were two Carmentas likewise, according to the general view: to one of them, called
Postverta, belonged the function of assisting the birth of the introverted child; while the
other, Prosa,959 executed the like office for the rightly born. The god Farinus was so called
from (his inspiring) the first utterance; while others believed in Locutius from his gift of
speech. Cunina960 is present as the protector of the child’s deep slumber, and supplies to it
refreshing rest. To lift them (when fallen)961 there is Levana, and along with her Rumina.962
It is a wonderful oversight that no gods were appointed for cleaning up the filth of children.
Then, to preside over their first pap and earliest drink you have Potina and Edula;963 to
teach the child to stand erect is the work of Statina,964 whilst Adeona helps him to come to

<head>Chapter XII.976—The Original Deities Were Human—With Some Very Questionable
Characteristics. Saturn or Time Was Human. Inconsistencies of Opinion About
Him.</head>
<p>Now, how much further need I go in recounting your gods—because I want to descant
on the character of such as you have adopted? It is quite uncertain whether I shall laugh at
your absurdity, or upbraid you for your blindness. For how many, and indeed what, gods
shall I bring forward? Shall it be the greater ones, or the lesser? The old ones, or the novel?
The male, or the female? The unmarried, or such as are joined in wedlock? The clever, or
the unskilful? The rustic or the town ones? The national or the foreign? For the truth is,977
there are so many families, so many nations, which require a catalogue978 (of gods), that
they cannot possibly be examined, or distinguished, or described. But the more diffuse the
subject is, the more restriction must we impose on it. As, therefore, in this review we keep
before us but one object—that of proving that all these gods were once human beings (not,
indeed, to instruct you in the fact,979 for your conduct shows that you have forgotten it)—let
us adopt our compendious summary from the most natural method980 of conducting the
examination, even by considering the origin of their race. For the origin characterizes all
that comes after it. Now this origin of your gods dates,981 I suppose, from Saturn. And when
Varro mentions Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, as the most ancient of the gods, it ought not to
have escaped our notice, that every father is more ancient than his sons, and that Saturn
therefore must precede Jupiter, even as Coelus does Saturn, for Saturn was sprung from
Coelus and Terra. I pass by, however, the origin of Coelus and Terra. They led in some unaccountable
way982 single lives, and had no children. Of course they required a long time
for vigorous growth to attain to such a stature.983 By and by, as soon as the voice of Coelus
began to break,984 and the breasts of Terra to become firm,985 they contract marriage with
one another. I suppose either Heaven986 came down to his spouse, or Earth went up to

meet her lord. Be that as it may, Earth conceived seed of Heaven, and when her year was
fulfilled brought forth Saturn in a wonderful manner. Which of his parents did he resemble?
Well, then, even after parentage began,987 it is certain988 that they had no child previous to
Saturn, and only one daughter afterwards—Ops; thenceforth they ceased to procreate. The
truth is, Saturn castrated Coelus as he was sleeping. We read this name Coelus as of the
masculine gender. And for the matter of that, how could he be a father unless he were a
male? But with what instrument was the castration effected? He had a scythe. What, so early
as that? For Vulcan was not yet an artificer in iron. The widowed Terra, however, although
still quite young, was in no hurry989 to marry another. Indeed, there was no second Coelus
for her. What but Ocean offers her an embrace? But he savours of brackishness, and she has
been accustomed to fresh water.990 And so Saturn is the sole male child of Coelus and Terra.
When grown to puberty, he marries his own sister. No laws as yet prohibited incest, nor
punished parricide. Then, when male children were born to him, he would devour them;
better himself (should take them) than the wolves, (for to these would they become a prey)
if he exposed them. He was, no doubt, afraid that one of them might learn the lesson of his
father’s scythe. When Jupiter was born in course of time, he was removed out of the way:991
(the father) swallowed a stone instead of the son, as was pretended. This artifice secured his
safety for a time; but at length the son, whom he had not devoured, and who had grown up
in secret, fell upon him, and deprived him of his kingdom. Such, then, is the patriarch of
the gods whom Heaven992 and Earth produced for you, with the poets officiating as midwives.
Now some persons with a refined993 imagination are of opinion that, by this allegorical
fable of Saturn, there is a physiological representation of Time: (they think) that it is because
all things are destroyed by Time, that Coelus and Terra were themselves parents without
having any of their own, and that the (fatal) scythe was used, and that (Saturn) devoured
his own offspring, because he,994 in fact, absorbs within himself all things which have issued
from him. They call in also the witness of his name; for they say that he is called Κρόνος in
Greek, meaning the same thing as χρόνος.995 His Latin name also they derive from seed-

sowing;996 for they suppose him to have been the actual procreator—that the seed, in fact,
was dropt down from heaven to earth by his means. They unite him with Ops, because seeds
produce the affluent treasure (Opem) of actual life, and because they develope with labour
(Opus). Now I wish that you would explain this metaphorical997 statement. It was either
Saturn or Time. If it was Time, how could it be Saturn? If he, how could it be Time? For
you cannot possibly reckon both these corporeal subjects998 as co-existing in one person.
What, however, was there to prevent your worshipping Time under its proper quality? Why
not make a human person, or even a mythic man, an object of your adoration, but each in
its proper nature not in the character of Time? What is the meaning of that conceit of your
mental ingenuity, if it be not to colour the foulest matters with the feigned appearance of
reasonable proofs?999 Neither, on the one hand, do you mean Saturn to be Time, because
you say he is a human being; nor, on the other hand, whilst portraying him as Time, do you
on that account mean that he was ever human. No doubt, in the accounts of remote antiquity
your god Saturn is plainly described as living on earth in human guise. Anything whatever
may obviously be pictured as incorporeal which never had an existence; there is simply no
room for such fiction, where there is reality. Since, therefore, there is clear evidence that
Saturn once existed, it is in vain that you change his character. He whom you will not deny
to have once been man, is not at your disposal to be treated anyhow, nor can it be maintained
that he is either divine or Time. In every page of your literature the origin1000 of Saturn is
conspicuous. We read of him in Cassius Severus and in the Corneliuses, Nepos and Tacitus,
1001 and, amongst the Greeks also, in Diodorus, and all other compilers of ancient annals.
1002 No more faithful records of him are to be traced than in Italy itself. For, after (traversing)
many countries, and (enjoying) the hospitality of Athens, he settled in Italy, or, as
it was called, OEnotria, having met with a kind welcome from Janus, or Janes,1003 as the Salii
call him. The hill on which he settled had the name Saturnius, whilst the city which he
founded1004 still bears the name Saturnia; in short, the whole of Italy once had the same
designation. Such is the testimony derived from that country which is now the mistress of
the world: whatever doubt prevails about the origin of Saturn, his actions tell us plainly that

he was a human being. Since, therefore, Saturn was human, he came undoubtedly from a
human stock; and more, because he was a man, he, of course, came not of Coelus and Terra.
Some people, however, found it easy enough to call him, whose parents were unknown, the
son of those gods from whom all may in a sense seem to be derived. For who is there that
does not speak under a feeling of reverence of the heaven and the earth as his own father
and mother? Or, in accordance with a custom amongst men, which induces them to say of
any who are unknown or suddenly apparent, that “they came from the sky?” Hence it
happened that, because a stranger appeared suddenly everywhere, it became the custom to
call him a heaven-born man,1005—just as we also commonly call earth-born all those whose
descent is unknown. I say nothing of the fact that such was the state of antiquity, when
men’s eyes and minds were so habitually rude, that they were excited by the appearance of
every newcomer as if it were that of a god: much more would this be the case with a king,
and that the primeval one. I will linger some time longer over the case of Saturn, because
by fully discussing his primordial history I shall beforehand furnish a compendious answer
for all other cases; and I do not wish to omit the more convincing testimony of your sacred
literature, the credit of which ought to be the greater in proportion to its antiquity. Now
earlier than all literature was the Sibyl; that Sibyl, I mean, who was the true prophetess of
truth, from whom you borrow their title for the priests of your demons. She in senarian
verse expounds the descent of Saturn and his exploits in words to this effect: “In the tenth
generation of men, after the flood had overwhelmed the former race, reigned Saturn, and
Titan, and Japetus, the bravest of the sons of Terra and Coelus.” Whatever credit, therefore,
is attached to your older writers and literature, and much more to those who were the
simplest as belonging to that age,1006 it becomes sufficiently certain that Saturn and his
family1007 were human beings. We have in our possession, then, a brief principle which
amounts to a prescriptive rule about their origin serving for all other cases, to prevent our
going wrong in individual instances. The particular character1008 of a posterity is shown by
the original founders of the race—mortal beings (come) from mortals, earthly ones from
earthly; step after step comes in due relation1009—marriage, conception, birth—country,
settlements, kingdoms, all give the clearest proofs.1010 They, therefore who cannot deny the
birth of men, must also admit their death; they who allow their mortality must not suppose
them to be gods.</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.1011—The Gods Human at First. Who Had the Authority to Make
Them Divine? Jupiter Not Only Human, But Immoral.</head>
<p>Manifest cases, indeed, like these have a force peculiarly their own. Men like Varro and
his fellow-dreamers admit into the ranks of the divinity those whom they cannot assert to
have been in their primitive condition anything but men; (and this they do) by affirming
that they became gods after their death. Here, then, I take my stand. If your gods were
elected1012 to this dignity and deity,1013 just as you recruit the ranks of your senate, you
cannot help conceding, in your wisdom, that there must be some one supreme sovereign
who has the power of selecting, and is a kind of Cæsar; and nobody is able to confer1014 on
others a thing over which he has not absolute control. Besides, if they were able to make
gods of themselves after their death, pray tell me why they chose to be in an inferior condition
at first? Or, again, if there is no one who made them gods, how can they be said to have been
made such, if they could only have been made by some one else? There is therefore no
ground afforded you for denying that there is a certain wholesale distributor1015 of divinity.
Let us accordingly examine the reasons for despatching mortal beings to heaven. I suppose
you will produce a pair of them. Whoever, then, is the awarder (of the divine honours), exercises
his function, either that he may have some supports, or defences, or it may be even
ornaments to his own dignity; or from the pressing claims of the meritorious, that he may
reward all the deserving. No other cause is it permitted us to conjecture. Now there is no
one who, when bestowing a gift on another, does not act with a view to his own interest or
the other’s. This conduct, however, cannot be worthy of the Divine Being, inasmuch as His
power is so great that He can make gods outright; whilst His bringing man into such request,
on the pretence that he requires the aid and support of certain, even dead persons, is a
strange conceit, since He was able from the very first to create for Himself immortal beings.
He who has compared human things with divine will require no further arguments on these
points. And yet the latter opinion ought to be discussed, that God conferred divine honours
in consideration of meritorious claims. Well, then, if the award was made on such grounds,
if heaven was opened to men of the primitive age because of their deserts, we must reflect
that after that time no one was worthy of such honour; except it be, that there is now no
longer such a place for any one to attain to. Let us grant that anciently men may have deserved
heaven by reason of their great merits. Then let us consider whether there really was such
merit. Let the man who alleges that it did exist declare his own view of merit. Since the ac-

tions of men done in the very infancy of time1016 are a valid claim for their deification, you
consistently admitted to the honour the brother and sister who were stained with the sin of
incest—Ops and Saturn. Your Jupiter too, stolen in his infancy, was unworthy of both the
home and the nutriment accorded to human beings; and, as he deserved for so bad a child,
he had to live in Crete.1017 Afterwards, when full-grown, he dethrones his own father, who,
whatever his parental character may have been, was most prosperous in his reign, king as
he was of the golden age. Under him, a stranger to toil and want, peace maintained its joyous
and gentle sway; under him—
<lg>
<l>“Nulli subigebant arva coloni;”1018</l>
<l>“No swains would bring the fields beneath their sway;”1019</l>

But he hated a father who had been guilty of incest, and had once mutilated his1021 grandfather.
And yet, behold, he himself marries his own sister; so that I should suppose the old
adage was made for him: Τοῦ πατρὸς τὸ παιδίον—“Father’s own child.” There was “not a
pin to choose” between the father’s piety and the son’s. If the laws had been just even at that
early time,1022 Jupiter ought to have been “sewed up in both sacks.”1023 After this corroboration
of his lust with incestuous gratification, why should he hesitate to indulge himself
lavishly in the lighter excesses of adultery and debauchery? Ever since1024 poetry sported
thus with his character, in some such way as is usual when a runaway slave1025 is posted up
in public, we have been in the habit of gossiping without restraint1026 of his tricks1027 in
our chat with passers-by;1028 sometimes sketching him out in the form of the very money

from their kings, and princes, and instructors,1037 was not of the self-same nature, it was
in some other way1038 that similarity of character was exacted by their authority. But how
much the worst of them was he who (ought to have been, but) was not, the best of them?
By a title peculiar to him, you are indeed in the habit of calling Jupiter “the Best,”1039 whilst
in Virgil he is “Æquus Jupiter.”1040 All therefore were like him—incestuous towards their

<head>Chapter XIV.—Gods, Those Which Were Confessedly Elevated to the Divine Condition,
What Pre-Eminent Right Had They to Such Honour? Hercules an Inferior
Character.</head>
<p>But since they will have it that those who have been admitted from the human state to
the honours of deification should be kept separate from others, and that the distinction
which Dionysius the Stoic drew should be made between the native and the factitious1041
gods, I will add a few words concerning this last class also. I will take Hercules himself for
raising the gist of a reply1042 (to the question) whether he deserved heaven and divine
honours? For, as men choose to have it, these honours are awarded to him for his merits.
If it was for his valour in destroying wild beasts with intrepidity, what was there in that so
very memorable? Do not criminals condemned to the games, though they are even consigned
to the contest of the vile arena, despatch several of these animals at one time, and that with
more earnest zeal? If it was for his world-wide travels, how often has the same thing been
accomplished by the rich at their pleasant leisure, or by philosophers in their slave-like
poverty?1043 Is it forgotten that the cynic Asclepiades on a single sorry cow,1044 riding on
her back, and sometimes nourished at her udder, surveyed1045 the whole world with a personal
inspection? Even if Hercules visited the infernal regions, who does not know that the
way to Hades is open to all? If you have deified him on account of his much carnage and
many battles, a much greater number of victories was gained by the illustrious Pompey, the
conqueror of the pirates who had not spared Ostia itself in their ravages; and (as to carnage),
how many thousands, let me ask, were cooped up in one corner of the citadel1046 of Carthage,
and slain by Scipio? Wherefore Scipio has a better claim to be considered a fit candidate
for deification1047 than Hercules. You must be still more careful to add to the claims of
(our) Hercules his debaucheries with concubines and wives, and the swathes1048 of Omphale,
and his base desertion of the Argonauts because he had lost his beautiful boy.1049 To this
mark of baseness add for his glorification likewise his attacks of madness, adore the arrows
which slew his sons and wife. This was the man who, after deeming himself worthy of a fu-

neral pile in the anguish of his remorse for his parricides,1050 deserved rather to die the
unhonoured death which awaited him, arrayed in the poisoned robe which his wife sent
him on account of his lascivious attachment (to another). You, however, raised him from
the pyre to the sky, with the same facility with which (you have distinguished in like manner)
another hero1051 also, who was destroyed by the violence of a fire from the gods. He having
devised some few experiments, was said to have restored the dead to life by his cures. He
was the son of Apollo, half human, although the grandson of Jupiter, and great-grandson
of Saturn (or rather of spurious origin, because his parentage was uncertain, as Socrates of
Argon has related; he was exposed also, and found in a worse tutelage than even Jove’s,
suckled even at the dugs of a dog); nobody can deny that he deserved the end which befell
him when he perished by a stroke of lightning. In this transaction, however, your most excellent
Jupiter is once more found in the wrong—impious to his grandson, envious of his
artistic skill. Pindar, indeed, has not concealed his true desert; according to him, he was
punished for his avarice and love of gain, influenced by which he would bring the living to
their death, rather than the dead to life, by the perverted use of his medical art which he put
up for sale.1052 It is said that his mother was killed by the same stroke, and it was only right
that she, who had bestowed so dangerous a beast on the world,1053 should escape to heaven
by the same ladder. And yet the Athenians will not be at a loss how to sacrifice to gods of
such a fashion, for they pay divine honours to Æsculapius and his mother amongst their
dead (worthies). As if, too, they had not ready to hand1054 their own Theseus to worship,
so highly deserving a god’s distinction! Well, why not? Did he not on a foreign shore abandon

<p>It would be tedious to take a survey of all those, too, whom you have buried amongst
the constellations, and audaciously minister to as gods.1057 I suppose your Castors, and
Perseus, and Erigona,1058 have just the same claims for the honours of the sky as Jupiter’s
own big boy1059 had. But why should we wonder? You have transferred to heaven even
dogs, and scorpions, and crabs. I postpone all remarks1060 concerning those whom you
worship in your oracles. That this worship exists, is attested by him who pronounces the
oracle.1061 Why; you will have your gods to be spectators even of sadness,1062 as is Viduus,
who makes a widow of the soul, by parting it from the body, and whom you have condemned,
by not permitting him to be enclosed within your city-walls; there is Cæculus also, to deprive
the eyes of their perception; and Orbana, to bereave seed of its vital power; moreover, there
is the goddess of death herself. To pass hastily by all others,1063 you account as gods the
sites of places or of the city; such are Father Janus (there being, moreover, the archer-goddess1064
Jana1065), and Septimontius of the seven hills.</p>
<p>Men sacrifice1066 to the same Genii, whilst they have altars or temples in the same places;
but to others besides, when they dwell in a strange place, or live in rented houses.1067 I say
nothing about Ascensus, who gets his name for his climbing propensity, and Clivicola, from
her sloping (haunts); I pass silently by the deities called Forculus from doors, and Cardea
from hinges, and Limentinus the god of thresholds, and whatever others are worshipped
by your neighbours as tutelar deities of their street doors.1068 There is nothing strange in

and Some Become Obsolete.</head>
<p>Well, but1073 certain men have discovered fruits and sundry necessaries of life, (and
hence are worthy of deification).1074 Now let me ask, when you call these persons “discoverers,”
do you not confess that what they discovered was already in existence? Why then do
you not prefer to honour the Author, from whom the gifts really come, instead of converting
the Author into mere discoverers? Previously he who made the discover, the inventor himself
no doubt expressed his gratitude to the Author; no doubt, too, he felt that He was God, to
whom really belonged the religious service,1075 as the Creator (of the gift), by whom also
both he who discovered and that which was discovered were alike created. The green fig
of Africa nobody at Rome had heard of when Cato introduced it to the Senate, in order that
he might show how near was that province of the enemy1076 whose subjugation he was
constantly urging. The cherry was first made common in Italy by Cn. Pompey, who imported
it from Pontus. I might possibly have thought the earliest introducers of apples amongst
the Romans deserving of the public honour1077 of deification. This, however, would be as
foolish a ground for making gods as even the invention of the useful arts. And yet if the
skilful men1078 of our own time be compared with these, how much more suitable would
deification be to the later generation than to the former! For, tell me, have not all the extant
inventions superseded antiquity,1079 whilst daily experience goes on adding to the new
stock? Those, therefore, whom you regard as divine because of their arts, you are really injuring
by your very arts, and challenging (their divinity) by means of rival attainments,
which cannot be surpassed.1080</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.1081—Conclusion, the Romans Owe Not Their Imperial Power to
Their Gods. The Great God Alone Dispenses Kingdoms, He is the God of the
Christians.</head>
<p>In conclusion, without denying all those whom antiquity willed and posterity has believed
to be gods, to be the guardians of your religion, there yet remains for our consideration that
very large assumption of the Roman superstitions which we have to meet in opposition to
you, O heathen, viz. that the Romans have become the lords and masters of the whole world,
because by their religious offices they have merited this dominion to such an extent that
they are within a very little of excelling even their own gods in power. One cannot wonder
that Sterculus, and Mutunus, and Larentina, have severally1082 advanced this empire to its
height! The Roman people has been by its gods alone ordained to such dominion. For I
could not imagine that any foreign gods would have preferred doing more for a strange nation
than for their own people, and so by such conduct become the deserters and neglecters, nay,
the betrayers of the native land wherein they were born and bred, and ennobled and buried.
Thus not even Jupiter could suffer his own Crete to be subdued by the Roman fasces, forgetting
that cave of Ida, and the brazen cymbals of the Corybantes, and the most pleasant odour
of the goat which nursed him on that dear spot. Would he not have made that tomb of his
superior to the whole Capitol, so that that land should most widely rule which covered the
ashes of Jupiter? Would Juno, too, be willing that the Punic city, for the love of which she
even neglected Samos, should be destroyed, and that, too, by the fires of the sons of Æneas?
Although I am well aware that
“Hic illius arma,
<lg>
<l>Hic currus fuit, hoc regnum des gentibus esse,</l>
<l>Si qua fata sinant, jam tunc tenditque fovetque.”1083</l>

to Larentina. But surely those gods of yours have not the power of conferring empire. For
when Jupiter reigned in Crete, and Saturn in Italy, and Isis in Egypt, it was even as men that
they reigned, to whom also were assigned many to assist them.1085 Thus he who serves also
makes masters, and the bond-slave1086 of Admetus1087 aggrandizes with empire the citizens
of Rome, although he destroyed his own liberal votary Croesus by deceiving him with ambiguous
oracles.1088 Being a god, why was he afraid boldly to foretell to him the truth that
he must lose his kingdom. Surely those who were aggrandized with the power of wielding
empire might always have been able to keep an eye, as it were,1089 on their own cities. If
they were strong enough to confer empire on the Romans, why did not Minerva defend
Athens from Xerxes? Or why did not Apollo rescue Delphi out of the hand of Pyrrhus? They
who lost their own cities preserve the city of Rome, since (forsooth) the religiousness1090
of Rome has merited the protection! But is it not rather the fact that this excessive devotion1091
has been devised since the empire has attained its glory by the increase of its power?
No doubt sacred rites were introduced by Numa, but then your proceedings were not marred
by a religion of idols and temples. Piety was simple,1092 and worship humble; altars were
artlessly reared,1093 and the vessels (thereof) plain, and the incense from them scant, and
the god himself nowhere. Men therefore were not religious before they achieved greatness,
(nor great) because they were religious. But how can the Romans possibly seem to have acquired
their empire by an excessive religiousness and very profound respect for the gods,
when that empire was rather increased after the gods had been slighted?1094 Now, if I am
not mistaken, every kingdom or empire is acquired and enlarged by wars, whilst they and
their gods also are injured by conquerors. For the same ruin affects both city-walls and
temples; similar is the carnage both of civilians and of priests; identical the plunder of profane
things and of sacred. To the Romans belong as many sacrileges as trophies; and then as
many triumphs over gods as over nations. Still remaining are their captive idols amongst
them; and certainly, if they can only see their conquerors, they do not give them their love.
Since, however, they have no perception, they are injured with impunity; and since they are

injured with impunity, they are worshipped to no purpose. The nation, therefore, which
has grown to its powerful height by victory after victory, cannot seem to have developed
owing to the merits of its religion—whether they have injured the religion by augmenting
their power, or augmented their power by injuring the religion. All nations have possessed
empire, each in its proper time, as the Assyrians, the Medes, the Persians, the Egyptians;
empire is even now also in the possession of some, and yet they that have lost their power
used not to behave1095 without attention to religious services and the worship of the gods,
even after these had become unpropitious to them,1096 until at last almost universal
dominion has accrued to the Romans. It is the fortune of the times that has thus constantly
shaken kingdoms with revolution.1097 Inquire who has ordained these changes in the times.
It is the same (great Being) who dispenses kingdoms,1098 and has now put the supremacy
of them into the hands of the Romans, very much as if1099 the tribute of many nations were
after its exaction amassed in one (vast) coffer. What He has determined concerning it, they
know who are the nearest to Him.1100</p>

<head>Appendix.
A Fragment Concerning the Execrable Gods of the
Heathen.</head>
<p>So great blindness has fallen on the Roman race, that they call their enemy Lord, and
preach the filcher of blessings as being their very giver, and to him they give thanks. They
call those (deities), then, by human names, not by their own, for their own names they know
not. That they are dæmons1101 they understand: but they read histories of the old kings,
and then, though they see that their character1102 was mortal, they honour them with a
deific name.</p>
<p>As for him whom they call Jupiter, and think to be the highest god, when he was born
the years (that had elapsed) from the foundation of the world1103 to him1104 were some
three thousand. He is born in Greece, from Saturnus and Ops; and, for fear he should be
killed by his father (or else, if it is lawful to say so, should be begotten1105 anew), is by the
advice of his mother carried down into Crete, and reared in a cave of Ida; is concealed from
his father’s search) by (the aid of) Cretans—born men!1106—rattling their arms; sucks a
she-goat’s dugs; flays her; clothes himself in her hide; and (thus) uses his own nurse’s hide,
after killing her, to be sure, with his own hand! but he sewed thereon three golden tassels
worth the price of an hundred oxen each, as their author Homer1107 relates, if it is fair to
believe it. This Jupiter, in adult age, waged war several years with his father; overcame him;

it would mean a distributor of destinies; which latter derivation and meaning Liddell and Scott incline to.</note>

“birth” of “the highest god;” 2ndly, that these should have had the power to do him so essential service as to
conceal him from the search of his own father, likewise a mighty deity, by the simple expedient of rattling their
arms.</note>

made a parricidal raid on his home; violated his virgin sisters;1108 selected one of them in
marriage; drave1109 his father by dint of arms. The remaining scenes, moreover, of that act
have been recorded. Of other folks’ wives, or else of violated virgins, he begat him sons; defiled
freeborn boys; oppressed peoples lawlessly with despotic and kingly sway. The father, whom
they erringly suppose to have been the original god, was ignorant that this (son of his) was
lying concealed in Crete; the son, again, whom they believe the mightier god, knows not
that the father whom himself had banished is lurking in Italy. If he was in heaven, when
would he not see what was doing in Italy? For the Italian land is “not in a corner.”1110 And
yet, had he been a god, nothing ought to have escaped him. But that he whom the Italians
call Saturnus did lurk there, is clearly evidenced on the face of it, from the fact that from his
lurking1111 the Hesperian1112 tongue is to this day called Latin,1113 as likewise their author
Virgil relates.1114 (Jupiter,) then, is said to have been born on earth, while (Saturnus his
father) fears lest he be driven by him from his kingdom, and seeks to kill him as being his
own rival, and knows not that he has been stealthily carried off, and is in hiding; and afterwards
the son-god pursues his father, immortal seeks to slay immortal (is it credible?1115),
and is disappointed by an interval of sea, and is ignorant of (his quarry’s) flight; and while
all this is going on between two gods on earth, heaven is deserted. No one dispensed the
rains, no one thundered, no one governed all this mass of world.1116 For they cannot even
say that their action and wars took place in heaven; for all this was going on on Mount
Olympus in Greece. Well, but heaven is not called Olympus, for heaven is heaven.</p>
<p>These, then, are the actions of theirs, which we will treat of first—nativity, lurking, ignorance,
parricide, adulteries, obscenities—things committed not by a god, but by most
impure and truculent human beings; beings who, had they been living in these days, would
have lain under the impeachment of all laws—laws which are far more just and strict than
their actions. “He drave his father by dint of arms.” The Falcidian and Sempronian law
would bind the parricide in a sack with beasts. “He violated his sisters.” The Papinian law

would punish the outrage with all penalties, limb by limb. “He invaded others’ wedlock.”
The Julian law would visit its adulterous violator capitally. “He defiled freeborn boys.” The
Cornelian law would condemn the crime of transgressing the sexual bond with novel
severities, sacrilegiously guilty as it is of a novel union.1117 This being is shown to have had
no divinity either, for he was a human being; his father’s flight escaped him. To this human
being, of such a character, to so wicked a king, so obscene and so cruel, God’s honour has
been assigned by men. Now, to be sure, if on earth he were born and grew up through the
advancing stages of life’s periods, and in it committed all these evils, and yet is no more in
it, what is thought1118 (of him) but that he is dead? Or else does foolish error think wings
were born him in his old age, whence to fly heavenward? Why, even this may possibly find
credit among men bereft of sense,1119 if indeed they believe, (as they do,) that he turned
into a swan, to beget the Castors;1120 an eagle, to contaminate Ganymede; a bull, to violate
Europa; gold, to violate Danaë; a horse, to beget Pirithoüs; a goat, to beget Egyppa1121 from
a she-goat; a Satyr, to embrace Antiope. Beholding these adulteries, to which sinners are
prone, they therefore easily believe that sanctions of misdeed and of every filthiness are
borrowed from their feigned god. Do they perceive how void of amendment are the rest of
his career’s acts which can find credit, which are indeed true, and which, they say, he did
without self transformation? Of Semele, he begets Liber;1122 of Latona, Apollo and Diana;
of Maia, Mercury; of Alcmena, Hercules. But the rest of his corruptions, which they themselves
confess, I am unwilling to record, lest turpitude, once buried, be again called to men’s
ears. But of these few (offsprings of his) I have made mention; off-springs whom in their
error they believe to be themselves, too, gods—born, to wit, of an incestuous father; adulterous
births, supposititious births. And the living,1123 eternal God, of sempiternal divinity,

<head>Chapter I.—Occasion of Writing. Relative Position of Jews and Gentiles Illustrated.</head>
<p>It happened very recently a dispute was held between a Christian and a Jewish proselyte.
Alternately with contentious cable they each spun out the day until evening. By the opposing
din, moreover, of some partisans of the individuals, truth began to be overcast by a sort of
cloud. It was therefore our pleasure that that which, owing to the confused noise of disputation,
could be less fully elucidated point by point, should be more carefully looked into, and
that the pen should determine, for reading purposes, the questions handled.</p>
<p>For the occasion, indeed, of claiming Divine grace even for the Gentiles derived a preeminent
fitness from this fact, that the man who set up to vindicate God’s Law as his own
was of the Gentiles, and not a Jew “of the stock of the Israelites.”1127 For this fact—that
Gentiles are admissible to God’s Law—is enough to prevent Israel from priding himself on
the notion that “the Gentiles are accounted as a little drop of a bucket,” or else as “dust out
of a threshing-floor:”1128 although we have God Himself as an adequate engager and faithful
promiser, in that He promised to Abraham that “in his seed should be blest all nations of
the earth;”1129 and that1130 out of the womb of Rebecca “two peoples and two nations were

have it as late as a.d. 208. Neander thinks the work, after the quotation from Isaiah in the beginning of chapter
ninth, is not our author’s, but was finished by another hand, clumsily annexing what is said on the same chapter
of Isaiah in the Third Book against Marcion. It is only slightly varied. Bp. Kaye admits the very striking facts
instanced by Neander, in support of this theory, but demolishes, with a word any argument drawn from thence
that the genuine work was written after the author’s lapse. This treatise is sufficiently annotated by Thelwall,

about to proceed,”1131—of course those of the Jews, that is, of Israel; and of the Gentiles,
that is ours. Each, then, was called a people and a nation; lest, from the nuncupative appellation,
any should dare to claim for himself the privilege of grace. For God ordained “two
peoples and two nations” as about to proceed out of the womb of one woman: nor did
grace1132 make distinction in the nuncupative appellation, but in the order of birth; to the
effect that, which ever was to be prior in proceeding from the womb, should be subjected
to “the less,” that is, the posterior. For thus unto Rebecca did God speak: “Two nations are
in thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided from thy bowels; and people shall overcome
people, and the greater shall serve the less.”1133 Accordingly, since the people or nation of
the Jews is anterior in time, and “greater” through the grace of primary favour in the Law,
whereas ours is understood to be “less” in the age of times, as having in the last era of the
world1134 attained the knowledge of divine mercy: beyond doubt, through the edict of the
divine utterance, the prior and “greater” people—that is, the Jewish—must necessarily serve
the “less;” and the “less” people—that is, the Christian—overcome the “greater.” For, withal,
according to the memorial records of the divine Scriptures, the people of the Jews—that is,
the more ancient—quite forsook God, and did degrading service to idols, and, abandoning
the Divinity, was surrendered to images; while “the people” said to Aaron, “Make us gods
to go before us.”1135 And when the gold out of the necklaces of the women and the rings of
the men had been wholly smelted by fire, and there had come forth a calf-like head, to this
figment Israel with one consent (abandoning God) gave honour, saying, “These are the gods
who brought us from the land of Egypt.”1136 For thus, in the later times in which kings were
governing them, did they again, in conjunction with Jeroboam, worship golden kine, and
groves, and enslave themselves to Baal.1137 Whence is proved that they have ever been depicted,
out of the volume of the divine Scriptures, as guilty of the crime of idolatry; whereas
our “less”—that is, posterior—people, quitting the idols which formerly it used slavishly to
serve, has been converted to the same God from whom Israel, as we have above related, had
departed.1138 For thus has the “less”—that is, posterior—people overcome the “greater
people,” while it attains the grace of divine favour, from which Israel has been divorced.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—The Law Anterior to Moses.</head>
<p>Stand we, therefore, foot to foot, and determine we the sum and substance of the actual
question within definite lists.</p>
<p>For why should God, the founder of the universe, the Governor of the whole world,1139
the Fashioner of humanity, the Sower1140 of universal nations be believed to have given a
law through Moses to one people, and not be said to have assigned it to all nations? For
unless He had given it to all by no means would He have habitually permitted even proselytes
out of the nations to have access to it. But—as is congruous with the goodness of God, and
with His equity, as the Fashioner of mankind—He gave to all nations the selfsame law, which
at definite and stated times He enjoined should be observed, when He willed, and through
whom He willed, and as He willed. For in the beginning of the world He gave to Adam
himself and Eve a law, that they were not to eat of the fruit of the tree planted in the midst
of paradise; but that, if they did contrariwise, by death they were to die.1141 Which law had
continued enough for them, had it been kept. For in this law given to Adam we recognise
in embryo1142 all the precepts which afterwards sprouted forth when given through Moses;
that is, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God from thy whole heart and out of thy whole soul;
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;1143 Thou shalt not kill; Thou shalt not commit
adultery; Thou shalt not steal; False witness thou shalt not utter; Honour thy father and
mother; and, That which is another’s, shalt thou not covet. For the primordial law was
given to Adam and Eve in paradise, as the womb of all the precepts of God. In short, if they
had loved the Lord their God, they would not have contravened His precept; if they had
habitually loved their neighbour—that is, themselves1144—they would not have believed
the persuasion of the serpent, and thus would not have committed murder upon themselves,
1145 by falling1146 from immortality, by contravening God’s precept; from theft also
they would have abstained, if they had not stealthily tasted of the fruit of the tree, nor had
been anxious to skulk beneath a tree to escape the view of the Lord their God; nor would
they have been made partners with the falsehood-asseverating devil, by believing him that
they would be “like God;” and thus they would not have offended God either, as their

Father, who had fashioned them from clay of the earth, as out of the womb of a mother; if
they had not coveted another’s, they would not have tasted of the unlawful fruit.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this general and primordial law of God, the observance of which, in the
case of the tree’s fruit, He had sanctioned, we recognise enclosed all the precepts specially
of the posterior Law, which germinated when disclosed at their proper times. For the subsequent
superinduction of a law is the work of the same Being who had before premised a
precept; since it is His province withal subsequently to train, who had before resolved to
form, righteous creatures. For what wonder if He extends a discipline who institutes it? if
He advances who begins? In short, before the Law of Moses,1147 written in stone-tables, I
contend that there was a law unwritten, which was habitually understood naturally, and by
the fathers was habitually kept. For whence was Noah “found righteous,”1148 if in his case
the righteousness of a natural law had not preceded? Whence was Abraham accounted “a
friend of God,”1149 if not on the ground of equity and righteousness, (in the observance)
of a natural law? Whence was Melchizedek named “priest of the most high God,”1150 if,
before the priesthood of the Levitical law, there were not levites who were wont to offer
sacrifices to God? For thus, after the above-mentioned patriarchs, was the Law given to
Moses, at that (well-known) time after their exode from Egypt, after the interval and spaces
of four hundred years. In fact, it was after Abraham’s “four hundred and thirty years”1151
that the Law was given. Whence we understand that God’s law was anterior even to Moses,
and was not first (given) in Horeb, nor in Sinai and in the desert, but was more ancient;
(existing) first in paradise, subsequently reformed for the patriarchs, and so again for the
Jews, at definite periods: so that we are not to give heed to Moses’ Law as to the primitive
law, but as to a subsequent, which at a definite period God has set forth to the Gentiles too
and, after repeatedly promising so to do through the prophets, has reformed for the better;
and has premonished that it should come to pass that, just as “the law was given through
Moses”1152 at a definite time, so it should be believed to have been temporarily observed
and kept. And let us not annul this power which God has, which reforms the law’s precepts
answerably to the circumstances of the times, with a view to man’s salvation. In fine, let him
who contends that the Sabbath is still to be observed as a balm of salvation, and circumcision
on the eighth day because of the threat of death, teach us that, for the time past, righteous
men kept the Sabbath, or practised circumcision, and were thus rendered “friends of God.”

For if circumcision purges a man since God made Adam uncircumcised, why did He not
circumcise him, even after his sinning, if circumcision purges? At all events, in settling him
in paradise, He appointed one uncircumcised as colonist of paradise. Therefore, since God
originated Adam uncircumcised, and inobservant of the Sabbath, consequently his offspring
also, Abel, offering Him sacrifices, uncircumcised and inobservant of the Sabbath, was by
Him commended; while He accepted1153 what he was offering in simplicity of heart, and
reprobated the sacrifice of his brother Cain, who was not rightly dividing what he was offering.
1154 Noah also, uncircumcised—yes, and inobservant of the Sabbath—God freed from
the deluge.1155 For Enoch, too, most righteous man, uncircumcised and inobservant of the
Sabbath, He translated from this world;1156 who did not first taste1157 death, in order that,
being a candidate for eternal life,1158 he might by this time show us that we also may, without
the burden of the law of Moses, please God. Melchizedek also, “the priest of the most high
God,” uncircumcised and inobservant of the Sabbath, was chosen to the priesthood of
God.1159 Lot, withal, the brother1160 of Abraham, proves that it was for the merits of

<head>Chapter III.—Of Circumcision and the Supercession of the Old Law.</head>
<p>But Abraham, (you say,) was circumcised. Yes, but he pleased God before his circumcision;
1162 nor yet did he observe the Sabbath. For he had “accepted”1163 circumcision; but
such as was to be for “a sign” of that time, not for a prerogative title to salvation. In fact,
subsequent patriarchs were uncircumcised, like Melchizedek, who, uncircumcised, offered
to Abraham himself, already circumcised, on his return from battle, bread and wine.1164
“But again,” (you say) “the son of Moses would upon one occasion have been choked by an
angel, if Zipporah,1165 had not circumcised the foreskin of the infant with a pebble; whence,
“there is the greatest peril if any fail to circumcise the foreskin of his flesh.” Nay, but if circumcision
altogether brought salvation, even Moses himself, in the case of his own son,
would not have omitted to circumcise him on the eighth day; whereas it is agreed that Zipporah
did it on the journey, at the compulsion of the angel. Consider we, accordingly, that
one single infant’s compulsory circumcision cannot have prescribed to every people, and
founded, as it were, a law for keeping this precept. For God, foreseeing that He was about
to give this circumcision to the people of Israel for “a sign,” not for salvation, urges the circumcision
of the son of Moses, their future leader, for this reason; that, since He had begun,
through him, to give the People the precept of circumcision, the people should not despise
it, from seeing this example (of neglect) already exhibited conspicuously in their leader’s
son. For circumcision had to be given; but as “a sign,” whence Israel in the last time would
have to be distinguished, when, in accordance with their deserts, they should be prohibited
from entering the holy city, as we see through the words of the prophets, saying, “Your land
is desert; your cities utterly burnt with fire; your country, in your sight, strangers shall eat
up; and, deserted and subverted by strange peoples, the daughter of Zion shall be derelict,
like a shed in a vineyard, and like a watchhouse in a cucumber-field, and as it were a city
which is being stormed.”1166 Why so? Because the subsequent discourse of the prophet
reproaches them, saying, “Sons have I begotten and upraised, but they have reprobated
me;”1167 and again, “And if ye shall have outstretched hands, I will avert my face from you;
and if ye shall have multiplied prayers, I will not hear you: for your hands are full of

blood;”1168 and again, “Woe! sinful nation; a people full of sins; wicked sons; ye have quite
forsaken God, and have provoked unto indignation the Holy One of Israel.”1169 This,
therefore, was God’s foresight,—that of giving circumcision to Israel, for a sign whence they
might be distinguished when the time should arrive wherein their above-mentioned deserts
should prohibit their admission into Jerusalem: which circumstance, because it was to be,
used to be announced; and, because we see it accomplished, is recognised by us. For, as the
carnal circumcision, which was temporary, was in wrought for “a sign” in a contumacious
people, so the spiritual has been given for salvation to an obedient people; while the
prophet Jeremiah says, “Make a renewal for you, and sow not in thorns; be circumcised to
God, and circumcise the foreskin of your heart:”1170 and in another place he says, “Behold,
days shall come, saith the Lord, and I will draw up, for the house of Judah and for the house
of Jacob,1171 a new testament; not such as I once gave their fathers in the day wherein I led
them out from the land of Egypt.”1172 Whence we understand that the coming cessation of
the former circumcision then given, and the coming procession of a new law (not such as
He had already given to the fathers), are announced: just as Isaiah foretold, saying that in
the last days the mount of the Lord and the house of God were to be manifest above the
tops of the mounts: “And it shall be exalted,” he says, “above the hills; and there shall come
over it all nations; and many shall walk, and say, Come, ascend we unto the mount of the
Lord, and unto the house of the God of Jacob,”1173—not of Esau, the former son, but of
Jacob, the second; that is, of our “people,” whose “mount” is Christ, “præcised without
concisors’ hands,1174 filling every land,” shown in the book of Daniel.1175 In short, the
coming procession of a new law out of this “house of the God of Jacob” Isaiah in the ensuing
words announces, saying, “For from Zion shall go out a law, and the word of the Lord out
of Jerusalem, and shall judge among the nations,”—that is, among us, who have been called
out of the nations,—“and they shall join to beat their glaives into ploughs, and their lances
into sickles; and nations shall not take up glaive against nation, and they shall no more learn
to fight.”1176 Who else, therefore, are understood but we, who, fully taught by the new law,
observe these practices,—the old law being obliterated, the coming of whose abolition the

action itself1177 demonstrates? For the wont of the old law was to avenge itself by the vengeance
of the glaive, and to pluck out “eye for eye,” and to inflict retaliatory revenge for injury.
1178 But the new law’s wont was to point to clemency, and to convert to tranquillity
the pristine ferocity of “glaives” and “lances,” and to remodel the pristine execution of “war”
upon the rivals and foes of the law into the pacific actions of “ploughing” and “tilling” the
land.1179 Therefore as we have shown above that the coming cessation of the old law and
of the carnal circumcision was declared, so, too, the observance of the new law and the
spiritual circumcision has shone out into the voluntary obediences1180 of peace. For “a
people,” he says, “whom I knew not hath served me; in obedience of the ear it hath obeyed
me.”1181 Prophets made the announcement. But what is the “people” which was ignorant
of God, but ours, who in days bygone knew not God? and who, in the hearing of the ear,
gave heed to Him, but we, who, forsaking idols, have been converted to God? For Israel—who
had been known to God, and who had by Him been “upraised”1182 in Egypt, and was
transported through the Red Sea, and who in the desert, fed forty years with manna, was
wrought to the semblance of eternity, and not contaminated with human passions,1183 or
fed on this world’s1184 meats, but fed on “angel’s loaves”1185—the manna—and sufficiently
bound to God by His benefits—forgot his Lord and God, saying to Aaron: “Make us gods,
to go before us: for that Moses, who ejected us from the land of Egypt, hath quite forsaken
us; and what hath befallen him we know not.” And accordingly we, who “were not the people
of God” in days bygone, have been made His people,1186 by accepting the new law above
mentioned, and the new circumcision before foretold.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Of the Observance of the Sabbath.</head>
<p>It follows, accordingly, that, in so far as the abolition of carnal circumcision and of the
old law is demonstrated as having been consummated at its specific times, so also the observance
of the Sabbath is demonstrated to have been temporary.</p>
<p>For the Jews say, that from the beginning God sanctified the seventh day, by resting on
it from all His works which He made; and that thence it was, likewise, that Moses said to
the People: “Remember the day of the sabbaths, to sanctify it: every servile work ye shall
not do therein, except what pertaineth unto life.”1187 Whence we (Christians) understand
that we still more ought to observe a sabbath from all “servile work”1188 always, and not
only every seventh day, but through all time. And through this arises the question for us,
what sabbath God willed us to keep? For the Scriptures point to a sabbath eternal and a
sabbath temporal. For Isaiah the prophet says, “Your sabbaths my soul hateth;”1189 and in
another place he says, “My sabbaths ye have profaned.”1190 Whence we discern that the
temporal sabbath is human, and the eternal sabbath is accounted divine; concerning which
He predicts through Isaiah: “And there shall be,” He says, “month after month, and day
after day, and sabbath after sabbath; and all flesh shall come to adore in Jerusalem, saith the
Lord;”1191 which we understand to have been fulfilled in the times of Christ, when “all
flesh”—that is, every nation—“came to adore in Jerusalem” God the Father, through Jesus
Christ His Son, as was predicted through the prophet: “Behold, proselytes through me shall
go unto Thee.”1192 Thus, therefore, before this temporal sabbath, there was withal an
eternal sabbath foreshown and foretold; just as before the carnal circumcision there was
withal a spiritual circumcision foreshown. In short, let them teach us, as we have already
premised, that Adam observed the sabbath; or that Abel, when offering to God a holy victim,
pleased Him by a religious reverence for the sabbath; or that Enoch, when translated, had
been a keeper of the sabbath; or that Noah the ark-builder observed, on account of the deluge,
an immense sabbath; or that Abraham, in observance of the sabbath, offered Isaac his son;
or that Melchizedek in his priesthood received the law of the sabbath.</p>
<p>But the Jews are sure to say, that ever since this precept was given through Moses, the
observance has been binding. Manifest accordingly it is, that the precept was not eternal

nor spiritual, but temporary,1193 which would one day cease. In short, so true is it that it is
not in the exemption from work of the sabbath—that is, of the seventh day—that the celebration
of this solemnity is to consist, that Joshua the son of Nun, at the time that he was reducing
the city Jericho by war, stated that he had received from God a precept to order the
People that priests should carry the ark of the testament of God seven days, making the
circuit of the city; and thus, when the seventh day’s circuit had been performed, the walls
of the city would spontaneously fall.1194 Which was so done; and when the space of the
seventh day was finished, just as was predicted, down fell the walls of the city. Whence it is
manifestly shown, that in the number of the seven days there intervened a sabbath-day. For
seven days, whencesoever they may have commenced, must necessarily include within them
a sabbath-day; on which day not only must the priests have worked, but the city must have
been made a prey by the edge of the sword by all the people of Israel. Nor is it doubtful that
they “wrought servile work,” when, in obedience to God’s precept, they drave the preys of
war. For in the times of the Maccabees, too, they did bravely in fighting on the sabbaths,
and routed their foreign foes, and recalled the law of their fathers to the primitive style of
life by fighting on the sabbaths.1195 Nor should I think it was any other law which they thus
vindicated, than the one in which they remembered the existence of the prescript touching
“the day of the sabbaths.”1196</p>
<p>Whence it is manifest that the force of such precepts was temporary, and respected the
necessity of present circumstances; and that it was not with a view to its observance in perpetuity
that God formerly gave them such a law.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Of Sacrifices.</head>
<p>So, again, we show that sacrifices of earthly oblations and of spiritual sacrifices1197 were
predicted; and, moreover, that from the beginning the earthly were foreshown, in the person
of Cain, to be those of the “elder son,” that is, of Israel; and the opposite sacrifices demonstrated
to be those of the “younger son,” Abel, that is, of our people. For the elder, Cain,
offered gifts to God from the fruit of the earth; but the younger son, Abel, from the fruit of
his ewes. “God had respect unto Abel, and unto his gifts; but unto Cain and unto his gifts
He had not respect. And God said unto Cain, Why is thy countenance fallen? hast thou
not—if thou offerest indeed aright, but dost not divide aright—sinned? Hold thy peace. For
unto thee shalt thy conversion be and he shall lord it over thee. And then Cain said unto
Abel his brother, Let us go into the field: and he went away with him thither, and he slew
him. And then God said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not:
am I my brother’s keeper? To whom God said, The voice of the blood of thy brother crieth
forth unto me from the earth. Wherefore cursed is the earth, which hath opened her mouth
to receive the blood of thy brother. Groaning and trembling shalt thou be upon the earth,
and every one who shall have found thee shall slay thee.”1198 From this proceeding we
gather that the twofold sacrifices of “the peoples” were even from the very beginning foreshown.
In short, when the sacerdotal law was being drawn up, through Moses, in Leviticus,
we find it prescribed to the people of Israel that sacrifices should in no other place be offered
to God than in the land of promise; which the Lord God was about to give to “the people”
Israel and to their brethren, in order that, on Israel’s introduction thither, there should there
be celebrated sacrifices and holocausts, as well for sins as for souls; and nowhere else but in
the holy land.1199 Why, accordingly, does the Spirit afterwards predict, through the
prophets, that it should come to pass that in every place and in every land there should be
offered sacrifices to God? as He says through the angel Malachi, one of the twelve prophets:
“I will not receive sacrifice from your hands; for from the rising sun unto the setting my
Name hath been made famous among all the nations, saith the Lord Almighty: and in every
place they offer clean sacrifices to my Name.”1200 Again, in the Psalms, David says: “Bring
to God, ye countries of the nations”—undoubtedly because “unto every land” the preaching
of the apostles had to “go out”1201—“bring to God fame and honour; bring to God the sac-

rifices of His name: take up1202 victims and enter into His courts.”1203 For that it is not by
earthly sacrifices, but by spiritual, that offering is to be made to God, we thus read, as it is
written, An heart contribulate and humbled is a victim for God;”1204 and elsewhere, “Sacrifice
to God a sacrifice of praise, and render to the Highest thy vows.”1205 Thus, accordingly, the
spiritual “sacrifices of praise” are pointed to, and “an heart contribulate” is demonstrated
an acceptable sacrifice to God. And thus, as carnal sacrifices are understood to be reprobated—
of which Isaiah withal speaks, saying, “To what end is the multitude of your sacrifices
to me? saith the Lord”1206—so spiritual sacrifices are predicted1207 as accepted, as the
prophets announce. For, “even if ye shall have brought me,” He says, “the finest wheat flour,
it is a vain supplicatory gift: a thing execrable to me;” and again He says, “Your holocausts
and sacrifices, and the fat of goats, and blood of bulls, I will not, not even if ye come to be
seen by me: for who hath required these things from your hands?”1208 for “from the rising
sun unto the setting, my Name hath been made famous among all the nations, saith the
Lord.”1209 But of the spiritual sacrifices He adds, saying, “And in every place they offer clean

<head>Chapter VI.—Of the Abolition and the Abolisher of the Old Law.</head>
<p>Therefore, since it is manifest that a sabbath temporal was shown, and a sabbath eternal
foretold; a circumcision carnal foretold, and a circumcision spiritual pre-indicated; a law
temporal and a law eternal formally declared; sacrifices carnal and sacrifices spiritual foreshown;
it follows that, after all these precepts had been given carnally, in time preceding, to
the people Israel, there was to supervene a time whereat the precepts of the ancient Law and
of the old ceremonies would cease, and the promise1211 of the new law, and the recognition
of spiritual sacrifices, and the promise of the New Testament, supervene;1212 while the light
from on high would beam upon us who were sitting in darkness, and were being detained
in the shadow of death.1213 And so there is incumbent on us a necessity1214 binding us,
since we have premised that a new law was predicted by the prophets, and that not such as
had been already given to their fathers at the time when He led them forth from the land of
Egypt,1215 to show and prove, on the one hand, that that old Law has ceased, and on the
other, that the promised new law is now in operation.</p>
<p>And, indeed, first we must inquire whether there be expected a giver of the new law,
and an heir of the new testament, and a priest of the new sacrifices, and a purger of the new
circumcision, and an observer of the eternal sabbath, to suppress the old law, and institute
the new testament, and offer the new sacrifices, and repress the ancient ceremonies, and
suppress1216 the old circumcision together with its own sabbath,1217 and announce the new
kingdom which is not corruptible. Inquire, I say, we must, whether this giver of the new
law, observer of the spiritual sabbath, priest of the eternal sacrifices, eternal ruler of the
eternal kingdom, be come or no: that, if he is already come, service may have to be rendered
him; if he is not yet come, he may have to be awaited, until by his advent it be manifest that
the old Law’s precepts are suppressed, and that the beginnings of the new law ought to arise.
And, primarily, we must lay it down that the ancient Law and the prophets could not have
ceased, unless He were come who was constantly announced, through the same Law and
through the same prophets, as to come.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—The Question Whether Christ Be Come Taken Up.</head>
<p>Therefore upon this issue plant we foot to foot, whether the Christ who was constantly
announced as to come be already come, or whether His coming be yet a subject of hope.
For proof of which question itself, the times likewise must be examined by us when the
prophets announced that the Christ would come; that, if we succeed in recognising that He
has come within the limits of those times, we may without doubt believe Him to be the very
one whose future coming was ever the theme of prophetic song, upon whom we—the nations,
to wit—were ever announced as destined to believe; and that, when it shall have been agreed
that He is come, we may undoubtedly likewise believe that the new law has by Him been
given, and not disavow the new testament in Him and through Him drawn up for us. For
that Christ was to come we know that even the Jews do not attempt to disprove, inasmuch
as it is to His advent that they are directing their hope. Nor need we inquire at more length
concerning that matter, since in days bygone all the prophets have prophesied of it; as Isaiah:
“Thus saith the Lord God to my Christ (the) Lord,1218 whose right hand I have holden, that
the nations may hear Him: the powers of kings will I burst asunder; I will open before Him
the gates, and the cities shall not be closed to Him.” Which very thing we see fulfilled. For
whose right hand does God the Father hold but Christ’s, His Son?—whom all nations have
heard, that is, whom all nations have believed,—whose preachers, withal, the apostles, are
pointed to in the Psalms of David: “Into the universal earth,” says he, “is gone out their
sound, and unto the ends of the earth their words.”1219 For upon whom else have the universal
nations believed, but upon the Christ who is already come? For whom have the nations
believed,—Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and they who inhabit Mesopotamia, Armenia,
Phrygia, Cappadocia, and they who dwell in Pontus, and Asia, and Pamphylia, tarriers in
Egypt, and inhabiters of the region of Africa which is beyond Cyrene, Romans and sojourners,
yes, and in Jerusalem Jews,1220 and all other nations; as, for instance, by this time, the varied
races of the Gætulians, and manifold confines of the Moors, all the limits of the Spains, and
the diverse nations of the Gauls, and the haunts of the Britons—inaccessible to the Romans,
but subjugated to Christ, and of the Sarmatians, and Dacians, and Germans, and Scythians,
and of many remote nations, and of provinces and islands many, to us unknown, and which
we can scarce enumerate? In all which places the name of the Christ who is already come
reigns, as of Him before whom the gates of all cities have been opened, and to whom none

are closed, before whom iron bars have been crumbled, and brazen gates1221 opened. Although
there be withal a spiritual sense to be affixed to these expressions,—that the hearts
of individuals, blockaded in various ways by the devil, are unbarred by the faith of
Christ,—still they have been evidently fulfilled, inasmuch as in all these places dwells the
“people” of the Name of Christ. For who could have reigned over all nations but Christ,
God’s Son, who was ever announced as destined to reign over all to eternity? For if Solomon
“reigned,” why, it was within the confines of Judea merely: “from Beersheba unto Dan” the
boundaries of his kingdom are marked.1222 If, moreover, Darius “reigned” over the Babylonians
and Parthians, he had not power over all nations; if Pharaoh, or whoever succeeded
him in his hereditary kingdom, over the Egyptians, in that country merely did he possess
his kingdom’s dominion; if Nebuchadnezzar with his petty kings, “from India unto Ethiopia”
he had his kingdom’s boundaries;1223 if Alexander the Macedonian he did not hold more
than universal Asia, and other regions, after he had quite conquered them; if the Germans,
to this day they are not suffered to cross their own limits; the Britons are shut within the
circuit of their own ocean; the nations of the Moors, and the barbarism of the Gætulians,
are blockaded by the Romans, lest they exceed the confines of their own regions. What shall
I say of the Romans themselves,1224 who fortify their own empire with garrisons of their
own legions, nor can extend the might of their kingdom beyond these nations? But Christ’s
Name is extending everywhere, believed everywhere, worshipped by all the above-enumerated
nations, reigning everywhere, adored everywhere, conferred equally everywhere upon all.
No king, with Him, finds greater favour, no barbarian lesser joy; no dignities or pedigrees
enjoy distinctions of merit; to all He is equal, to all King, to all Judge, to all “God and
Lord.”1225 Nor would you hesitate to believe what we asseverate, since you see it taking

<head>Chapter VIII.—Of the Times of Christ’s Birth and Passion, and of Jerusalem’s Destruction.</head>
<p>Accordingly the times must be inquired into of the predicted and future nativity of the
Christ, and of His passion, and of the extermination of the city of Jerusalem, that is, its
devastation. For Daniel says, that “both the holy city and the holy place are exterminated
together with the coming Leader, and that the pinnacle is destroyed unto ruin.”1226 And so
the times of the coming Christ, the Leader,1227 must be inquired into, which we shall trace
in Daniel; and, after computing them, shall prove Him to be come, even on the ground of
the times prescribed, and of competent signs and operations of His. Which matters we
prove, again, on the ground of the consequences which were ever announced as to follow
His advent; in order that we may believe all to have been as well fulfilled as foreseen.</p>
<p>In such wise, therefore, did Daniel predict concerning Him, as to show both when and
in what time He was to set the nations free; and how, after the passion of the Christ, that
city had to be exterminated. For he says thus: “In the first year under Darius, son of Ahasuerus,
of the seed of the Medes, who reigned over the kingdom of the Chaldees, I Daniel
understood in the books the number of the years.…And while I was yet speaking in my
prayer, behold, the man Gabriel, whom I saw in the vision in the beginning, flying; and he
touched me, as it were, at the hour of the evening sacrifice, and made me understand, and
spake with me, and said, Daniel I am now come out to imbue thee with understanding; in
the beginning of thy supplication went out a word. And I am come to announce to thee,
because thou art a man of desires;1228 and ponder thou on the word, and understand in the
vision. Seventy hebdomads have been abridged1229 upon thy commonalty, and upon the
holy city, until delinquency be made inveterate, and sins sealed, and righteousness obtained
by entreaty, and righteousness eternal introduced; and in order that vision and prophet may
be sealed, and an holy one of holy ones anointed. And thou shalt know, and thoroughly
see, and understand, from the going forth of a word for restoring and rebuilding Jerusalem
unto the Christ, the Leader, hebdomads (seven and an half, and1230) lxii and an half: and it

shall convert, and shall be built into height and entrenchment, and the times shall be renewed:
and after these lxii hebdomads shall the anointing be exterminated, and shall not be; and
the city and the holy place shall he exterminate together with the Leader, who is making
His advent; and they shall be cut short as in a deluge, until (the) end of a war, which shall
be cut short unto ruin. And he shall confirm a testament in many. In one hebdomad and
the half of the hebdomad shall be taken away my sacrifice and libation, and in the holy place
the execration of devastation, (and1231) until the end of (the) time consummation shall be
given with regard to this devastation.”1232</p>
<p>Observe we, therefore, the limit,—how, in truth, he predicts that there are to be lxx
hebdomads, within which if they receive Him, “it shall be built into height and entrenchment,
and the times shall be renewed.” But God, foreseeing what was to be—that they will not
merely not receive Him, but will both persecute and deliver Him to death—both recapitulated,
and said, that in lx and ii and an half of an hebdomad He is born, and an holy one of holy
ones is anointed; but that when vii hebdomads1233 and an half were fulfilling, He had to
suffer, and the holy city had to be exterminated after one and an half hebdomad—whereby
namely, the seven and an half hebdomads have been completed. For he says thus: “And the
city and the holy place to be exterminated together with the leader who is to come; and they
shall be cut short as in a deluge; and he shall destroy the pinnacle unto ruin.”1234 Whence,
therefore, do we show that the Christ came within the lxii and an half hebdomads? We shall
count, moreover, from the first year of Darius, as at this particular time is shown to Daniel
this particular vision; for he says, “And understand and conjecture that at the completion
of thy word1235 I make thee these answers.” Whence we are bound to compute from the
first year of Darius, when Daniel saw this vision.</p>
<p>Let us see, therefore, how the years are filled up until the advent of the Christ:—

<p>Alexander the Macedonian…xii years (12)</p>
<p>Then, after Alexander, who had reigned over both Medes and Persians, whom he had

<p>After Cleopatra, Augustus reigned other…xliii years (43).</p>
<p>For all the years of the empire of Augustus were…lvi years (56).</p>
<p>Let us see, moreover, how in the forty-first year of the empire of Augustus, when he has
been reigning for xx and viii years after the death of Cleopatra, the Christ is born. (And the
same Augustus survived, after Christ is born, xv years; and the remaining times of years to
the day of the birth of Christ will bring us to the xl first year, which is the xx and viiith of
Augustus after the death of Cleopatra.) There are, (then,) made up cccxxx and vii years, v
months: (whence are filled up lxii hebdomads and an half: which make up ccccxxxvii years,
vi months:) on the day of the birth of Christ. And (then) “righteousness eternal” was
manifested, and “an Holy One of holy ones was anointed”—that is, Christ—and “sealed was
vision and prophet,” and “sins” were remitted, which, through faith in the name of Christ,
are washed away1238 for all who believe on Him. But what does he mean by saying that
“vision and prophecy are sealed?” That all prophets ever announced of Him that He was to
come and had to suffer. Therefore, since the prophecy was fulfilled through His advent, for
that reason he said that “vision and prophecy were sealed;” inasmuch as He is the signet of

all prophets, fulfilling all things which in days bygone they had announced of Him.1239 For
after the advent of Christ and His passion there is no longer “vision or prophet” to announce
Him as to come. In short, if this is not so, let the Jews exhibit, subsequently to Christ, any
volumes of prophets, visible miracles wrought by any angels, (such as those) which in bygone
days the patriarchs saw until the advent of Christ, who is now come; since which event
“sealed is vision and prophecy,” that is, confirmed. And justly does the evangelist1240 write,
“The law and the prophets (were) until John” the Baptist. For, on Christ’s being baptized,
that is, on His sanctifying the waters in His own baptism,1241 all the plenitude of bygone
spiritual grace-gifts ceased in Christ, sealing as He did all vision and prophecies, which by
His advent He fulfilled. Whence most firmly does he assert that His advent “seals visions
and prophecy.”</p>
<p>Accordingly, showing, (as we have done,) both the number of the years, and the time
of the lx two and an half fulfilled hebdomads, on completion of which, (we have shown)
that Christ is come, that is, has been born, let us see what (mean) other “vii and an half
hebdomads,” which have been subdivided in the abscision of1242 the former hebdomads;
(let us see, namely,) in what event they have been fulfilled:—
For, after Augustus who survived after the birth of Christ, are made up…xv years (15).
To whom succeeded Tiberius Cæsar, and held the empire…xx years, vii months, xxviii
days (20 etc.).</p>
<p>(In the fiftieth year of his empire Christ suffered, being about xxx years of age when he
suffered.)</p>
<p>Again Caius Cæsar, also called Caligula,…iii years, viii months, xiii days (3 etc.).</p>
<p>Nero Cæsar,…xi years, ix months, xiii days (11 etc.).</p>

Otho…iii days.</p>

<p>Vespasian, in the first year of his empire, subdues the Jews in war; and there are made

<p>Therefore, when these times also were completed, and the Jews subdued, there afterwards
ceased in that place “libations and sacrifices,” which thenceforward have not been able to
be in that place celebrated; for “the unction,” too,1243 was “exterminated” in that place after
the passion of Christ. For it had been predicted that the unction should be exterminated in
that place; as in the Psalms it is prophesied, “They exterminated my hands and feet.”1244
And the suffering of this “extermination” was perfected within the times of the lxx hebdomads,
under Tiberius Cæsar, in the consulate of Rubellius Geminus and Fufius Geminus,
in the month of March, at the times of the passover, on the eighth day before the calends of
April,1245 on the first day of unleavened bread, on which they slew the lamb at even, just as

saying to Pilate, when he was desirous to dismiss Him, “His blood be upon us, and upon

<head>Chapter IX.—Of the Prophecies of the Birth and Achievements of Christ.</head>
<p>Begin we, therefore, to prove that the Birth of Christ was announced by prophets; as
Isaiah (e.g.,) foretells, “Hear ye, house of David; no petty contest have ye with men, since
God is proposing a struggle. Therefore God Himself will give you a sign; Behold, the virgin1250
shall conceive, and bear a son, and ye shall call his name Emmanuel”1251 (which is,
interpreted, “God with us”1252): “butter and honey shall he eat;”1253: “since, ere the child
learn to call father or mother, he shall receive the power of Damascus and the spoils of
Samaria, in opposition to the king of the Assyrians.”1254</p>
<p>Accordingly the Jews say: Let us challenge that prediction of Isaiah, and let us institute
a comparison whether, in the case of the Christ who is already come, there be applicable to
Him, firstly, the name which Isaiah foretold, and (secondly) the signs of it1255 which he
announced of Him.</p>
<p>Well, then, Isaiah foretells that it behoves Him to be called Emmanuel; and that subsequently
He is to take the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria, in opposition to
the king of the Assyrians. “Now,” say they, “that (Christ) of yours, who is come, neither was
called by that name, nor engaged in warfare.” But we, on the contrary, have thought they
ought to be admonished to recall to mind the context of this passage as well. For subjoined
is withal the interpretation of Emmanuel—“God with us”1256—in order that you may regard
not the sound only of the name, but the sense too. For the Hebrew sound, which is Emmanuel,
has an interpretation, which is, God with us. Inquire, then, whether this speech,
“God with us” (which is Emmanuel), be commonly applied to Christ ever since Christ’s
light has dawned, and I think you will not deny it. For they who out of Judaism believe in
Christ, ever since their believing on Him, do, whenever they shall wish to say1257 Emmanuel,
signify that God is with us: and thus it is agreed that He who was ever predicted as Emmanuel
is already come, because that which Emmanuel signifies is come—that is, “God with us.”
Equally are they led by the sound of the name when they so understand “the power of
Damascus,” and “the spoils of Samaria,” and “the kingdom of the Assyrians,” as if they

portended Christ as a warrior; not observing that Scripture premises, “since, ere the child
learn to call father or mother, he shall receive the power of Damascus and the spoils of
Samaria, in opposition to the king of the Assyrians.” For the first step is to look at the
demonstration of His age, to see whether the age there indicated can possibly exhibit the
Christ as already a man, not to say a general. Forsooth, by His babyish cry the infant would
summon men to arms, and would give the signal of war not with clarion, but with rattle,
and point out the foe, not from His charger’s back or from a rampart, but from the back or
neck of His suckler and nurse, and thus subdue Damascus and Samaria in place of the breast.
(It is another matter if, among you, infants rush out into battle,—oiled first, I suppose, to
dry in the sun, and then armed with satchels and rationed on butter,—who are to know how
to lance sooner than how to lacerate the bosom!)1258 Certainly, if nature nowhere allows
this,—(namely,) to serve as a soldier before developing into manhood, to take “the power
of Damascus” before knowing your father,—it follows that the pronouncement is visibly
figurative. “But again,” say they, “nature suffers not a ‘virgin’ to be a parent; and yet the
prophet must be believed.” And deservedly so; for he bespoke credit for a thing incredible,
by saying that it was to be a sign. “Therefore,” he says, “shall a sign be given you. Behold, a
virgin shall conceive in womb, and bear a son.” But a sign from God, unless it had consisted
in some portentous novelty, would not have appeared a sign. In a word, if, when you are
anxious to cast any down from (a belief in) this divine prediction, or to convert whoever
are simple, you have the audacity to lie, as if the Scripture contained (the announcement),
that not “a virgin,” but “a young female,” was to conceive and bring forth; you are refuted
even by this fact, that a daily occurrence—the pregnancy and parturition of a young female,
namely—cannot possibly seem anything of a sign. And the setting before us, then, of a virginmother
is deservedly believed to be a sign; but not equally so a warrior-infant. For there
would not in this case again be involved the question of a sign; but, the sign of a novel birth
having been awarded, the next step after the sign is, that there is enunciated a different ensuing
ordering1259 of the infant, who is to eat “honey and butter.” Nor is this, of course, for
a sign. It is natural to infancy. But that he is to receive1260 “the power of Damascus and the
spoils of Samaria in opposition to the king of the Assyrians,” this is a wondrous sign. Keep
to the limit of (the infant’s) age, and inquire into the sense of the prediction; nay, rather,
repay to truth what you are unwilling to credit her with, and the prophecy becomes intelligible
by the relation of its fulfilment. Let those Eastern magi be believed, dowering with gold and
incense the infancy of Christ as a king;1261 and the infant has received “the power of Dam-

ascus” without battle and arms. For, besides the fact that it is known to all that the
“power”—for that is the “strength”—of the East is wont to abound in gold and odours, certain
it is that the divine Scriptures regard “gold” as constituting the “power” also of all other
nations; as it says1262 through Zechariah: “And Judah keepeth guard at Jerusalem, and shall
amass all the vigour of the surrounding peoples, gold and silver.”1263 For of this gift of
“gold” David likewise says, “And to Him shall be given of the gold of Arabia;”1264 and again,
“The kings of the Arabs and Saba shall bring Him gifts.”1265 For the East, on the one hand,
generally held the magi (to be) kings; and Damascus, on the other hand, used formerly to
be reckoned to Arabia before it was transferred into Syrophoenicia on the division of the
Syrias: the “power” whereof Christ then “received” in receiving its ensigns,—gold, to wit,
and odours. “The spoils,” moreover, “of Samaria” (He received in receiving) the magi
themselves, who, on recognising Him, and honouring Him with gifts, and adoring Him on
bended knee as Lord and King, on the evidence of the guiding and indicating star, became
“the spoils of Samaria,” that is, of idolatry—by believing, namely, on Christ. For (Scripture)
denoted idolatry by the name of “Samaria,” Samaria being ignominious on the score of idolatry;
for she had at that time revolted from God under King Jeroboam. For this, again, is
no novelty to the Divine Scriptures, figuratively to use a transference of name grounded on
parallelism of crimes. For it1266 calls your rulers “rulers of Sodom,” and your people the
“people of Gomorrha,”1267 when those cities had already long been extinct.1268 And elsewhere
it says, through a prophet, to the people of Israel, “Thy father (was) an Amorite, and
thy mother an Hittite;”1269 of whose race they were not begotten, but (were called their
sons) by reason of their consimilarity in impiety, whom of old (God) had called His own

as being equally great and proud of her sway, and triumphant over the saints.1273 On this
wise, accordingly, (Scripture)1274 entitled the magi also with the appellation of “Samaritans,”—“
despoiled” (of that) which they had had in common with the Samaritans, as we
have said—idolatry in opposition to the Lord. (It1275 adds), “in opposition,” moreover, “to
the king of the Assyrians,”—in opposition to the devil, who to this hour thinks himself to
be reigning, if he detrudes the saints from the religion of God.</p>
<p>Moreover, this our interpretation will be supported while (we find that) elsewhere as
well the Scriptures designate Christ a warrior, as we gather from the names of certain
weapons, and words of that kind. But by a comparison of the remaining senses the Jews
shall be convicted. “Gird thee,” says David, “the sword upon the thigh.”1276 But what do
you read above concerning the Christ? “Blooming in beauty above the sons of men; grace
is outpoured in thy lips.”1277 But very absurd it is if he was complimenting on the bloom
of his beauty and the grace of his lips, one whom he was girding for war with a sword; of
whom he proceeds subjunctively to say, “Outstretch and prosper, advance and reign!” And
he has added, “because of thy lenity and justice.”1278 Who will ply the sword without practising
the contraries to lenity and justice; that is, guile, and asperity, and injustice, proper
(of course) to the business of battles? See we, then, whether that which has another action
be not another sword,—that is, the Divine word of God, doubly sharpened1279 with the two
Testaments of the ancient law and the new law; sharpened by the equity of its own wisdom;
rendering to each one according to his own action.1280 Lawful , then, it was for the Christ
of God to be precinct, in the Psalms, without warlike achievements, with the figurative sword
of the word of God; to which sword is congruous the predicated “bloom,” together with the
“grace of the lips;” with which sword He was then “girt upon the thigh,” in the eye of David,
when He was announced as about to come to earth in obedience to God the Father’s decree.
“The greatness of thy right hand,” he says, “shall conduct thee”1281—the virtue to wit, of
the spiritual grace from which the recognition of Christ is deduced. “Thine arrows,” he says,
“are sharp,”1282—God’s everywhere-flying precepts (arrows) threatening the exposure1283

of every heart, and carrying compunction and transfixion to each conscience: “peoples shall
fall beneath thee,”1284—of course, in adoration. Thus mighty in war and weapon-bearing
is Christ; thus will He “receive the spoils,” not of “Samaria” alone, but of all nations as well.
Acknowledge that His “spoils” are figurative whose weapons you have learnt to be allegorical.
And thus, so far, the Christ who is come was not a warrior, because He was not predicted
as such by Isaiah.</p>
<p>“But if the Christ,” say they, “who is believed to be coming is not called Jesus, why is he
who is come called Jesus Christ?” Well, each name will meet in the Christ of God, in whom
is found likewise the appellation1285 Jesus. Learn the habitual character of your error. In
the course of the appointing of a successor to Moses, Oshea1286 the son of Nun1287 is certainly
transferred from his pristine name, and begins to be called Jesus.1288 Certainly, you say.
This we first assert to have been a figure of the future. For, because Jesus Christ was to introduce
the second people (which is composed of us nations, lingering deserted in the world1289
aforetime) into the land of promise, “flowing with milk and honey”1290 (that is, into the
possession of eternal life, than which nought is sweeter); and this had to come about, not
through Moses (that is, not through the Law’s discipline), but through Joshua (that is,
through the new law’s grace), after our circumcision with “a knife of rock”1291 (that is, with
Christ’s precepts, for Christ is in many ways and figures predicted as a rock1292); therefore
the man who was being prepared to act as images of this sacrament was inaugurated under
the figure of the Lord’s name, even so as to be named Jesus.1293 For He who ever spake to
Moses was the Son of God Himself; who, too, was always seen.1294 For God the Father none

ever saw, and lived.1295 And accordingly it is agreed that the Son of God Himself spake to
Moses, and said to the people, “Behold, I send mine angel before thy”—that is, the
people’s—“face, to guard thee on the march, and to introduce thee into the land which I
have prepared thee: attend to him, and be not disobedient to him; for he hath not escaped1296
thy notice, since my name is upon him.”1297 For Joshua was to introduce the people into
the land of promise, not Moses. Now He called him an “angel,” on account of the magnitude
of the mighty deeds which he was to achieve (which mighty deeds Joshua the son of Nun
did, and you yourselves read), and on account of his office of prophet announcing (to wit)
the divine will; just as withal the Spirit, speaking in the person of the Father, calls the forerunner
of Christ, John, a future “angel,” through the prophet: “Behold, I send mine angel
before Thy”—that is, Christ’s—“face, who shall prepare Thy way before Thee.”1298 Nor is
it a novel practice to the Holy Spirit to call those “angels” whom God has appointed as
ministers of His power. For the same John is called not merely an “angel” of Christ, but
withal a “lamp” shining before Christ: for David predicts, “I have prepared the lamp for my
Christ;”1299 and him Christ Himself, coming “to fulfil the prophets,”1300 called so to the
Jews. “He was,” He says, “the burning and shining lamp;”1301 as being he who not merely
“prepared His ways in the desert,”1302 but withal, by pointing out “the Lamb of God,”1303
illumined the minds of men by his heralding, so that they understood Him to be that Lamb
whom Moses was wont to announce as destined to suffer. Thus, too, (was the son of Nun
called) Joshua, on account of the future mystery1304 of his name: for that name (He who
spake with Moses) confirmed as His own which Himself had conferred on him, because He
had bidden him thenceforth be called, not “angel” nor “Oshea,” but “Joshua.” Thus, therefore,
each name is appropriate to the Christ of God—that He should be called Jesus as well (as
Christ).</p>

must derive her lineage of the seed of David, the prophet in subsequent passages evidently

asserts. “And there shall be born,” he says, “a rod from the root of Jesse”—which rod is
Mary—“and a flower shall ascend from his root: and there shall rest upon him the Spirit of
God, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of discernment and piety, the spirit
of counsel and truth; the spirit of God’s fear shall fill Him.”1305 For to none of men was the
universal aggregation of spiritual credentials appropriate, except to Christ; paralleled as He
is to a “flower” by reason of glory, by reason of grace; but accounted “of the root of Jesse,”
whence His origin is to be deduced,—to wit, through Mary.1306 For He was from the native
soil of Bethlehem, and from the house of David; as, among the Romans, Mary is described
in the census, of whom is born Christ.1307</p>
<p>I demand, again—granting that He who was ever predicted by prophets as destined to
come out of Jesse’s race, was withal to exhibit all humility, patience, and tranquillity—whether
He be come? Equally so (in this case as in the former), the man who is shown to bear that
character will be the very Christ who is come. For of Him the prophet says, “A man set in
a plague, and knowing how to bear infirmity;” who “was led as a sheep for a victim; and, as
a lamb before him who sheareth him, opened not His mouth.”1308 If He “neither did contend
nor shout, nor was His voice heard abroad,” who “crushed not the bruised reed”—Israel’s
faith, who “quenched not the burning flax”1309—that is, the momentary glow of the Gentiles—
but made it shine more by the rising of His own light,—He can be none other than
He who was predicted. The action, therefore, of the Christ who is come must be examined
by being placed side by side with the rule of the Scriptures. For, if I mistake not, we find
Him distinguished by a twofold operation,—that of preaching and that of power. Now, let
each count be disposed of summarily. Accordingly, let us work out the order we have set
down, teaching that Christ was announced as a preacher; as, through Isaiah: “Cry out,” he
says, “in vigour, and spare not; lift up, as with a trumpet, thy voice, and announce to my
commonalty their crimes, and to the house of Jacob their sins. Me from day to day they
seek, and to learn my ways they covet, as a people which hath done righteousness, and hath
not forsaken the judgment of God,” and so forth:1310 that, moreover, He was to do acts of
power from the Father: “Behold, our God will deal retributive judgment; Himself will come
and save us: then shall the infirm be healed, and the eyes of the blind shall see, and the ears
of the deaf shall hear, and the mutes’ tongues shall be loosed, and the lame shall leap as an
hart,”1311 and so on; which works not even you deny that Christ did, inasmuch as you were

<head>Chapter X.—Concerning the Passion of Christ, and Its Old Testament Predictions
and Adumbrations.</head>
<p>Concerning the last step, plainly, of His passion you raise a doubt; affirming that the
passion of the cross was not predicted with reference to Christ, and urging, besides, that it
is not credible that God should have exposed His own Son to that kind of death; because
Himself said, “Cursed is every one who shall have hung on a tree.”1313 But the reason of the
case antecedently explains the sense of this malediction; for He says in Deuteronomy: “If,
moreover, (a man) shall have been (involved) in some sin incurring the judgment of death,
and shall die, and ye shall suspend him on a tree, his body shall not remain on the tree, but
with burial ye shall bury him on the very day; because cursed by God is every one who shall
have been suspended on a tree; and ye shall not defile the land which the Lord thy God shall
give thee for (thy) lot.”1314 Therefore He did not maledictively adjudge Christ to this passion,
but drew a distinction, that whoever, in any sin, had incurred the judgment of death, and
died suspended on a tree, he should be “cursed by God,” because his own sins were the cause
of his suspension on the tree. On the other hand, Christ, who spoke not guile from His
mouth,1315 and who exhibited all righteousness and humility, not only (as we have above
recorded it predicted of Him) was not exposed to that kind of death for his own deserts, but
(was so exposed) in order that what was predicted by the prophets as destined to come upon
Him through your means1316 might be fulfilled; just as, in the Psalms, the Spirit Himself of
Christ was already singing, saying, “They were repaying me evil for good;”1317 and, “What
I had not seized I was then paying in full;”1318 “They exterminated my hands and feet;”1319
and, “They put into my drink gall, and in my thirst they slaked me with vinegar;”1320 “Upon
my vesture they did cast (the) lot;”1321 just as the other (outrages) which you were to commit
on Him were foretold,—all which He, actually and thoroughly suffering, suffered not for
any evil action of His own, but “that the Scriptures from the mouth of the prophets might
be fulfilled.”1322</p>

<p>And, of course, it had been meet that the mystery1323 of the passion itself should be
figuratively set forth in predictions; and the more incredible (that mystery), the more likely
to be “a stumbling-stone,”1324 if it had been nakedly predicted; and the more magnificent,
the more to be adumbrated, that the difficulty of its intelligence might seek (help from) the
grace of God.</p>
<p>Accordingly, to begin with, Isaac, when led by his father as a victim, and himself bearing
his own “wood,”1325 was even at that early period pointing to Christ’s death; conceded, as
He was, as a victim by the Father; carrying, as He did, the “wood” of His own passion.1326</p>
<p>Joseph, again, himself was made a figure of Christ1327 in this point alone (to name no
more, not to delay my own course), that he suffered persecution at the hands of his brethren,
and was sold into Egypt, on account of the favour of God;1328 just as Christ was sold by Israel—(
and therefore,) “according to the flesh,” by His “brethren”1329—when He is betrayed
by Judas.1330 For Joseph is withal blest by his father1331 after this form: “His glory (is that)
of a bull; his horns, the horns of an unicorn; on them shall he toss nations alike unto the
very extremity of the earth.” Of course no one-horned rhinoceros was there pointed to, nor
any two-horned minotaur. But Christ was therein signified: “bull,” by reason of each of His
two characters,—to some fierce, as Judge; to others gentle, as Saviour; whose “horns” were
to be the extremities of the cross. For even in a ship’s yard—which is part of a cross—this is
the name by which the extremities are called; while the central pole of the mast is a “unicorn.”
By this power, in fact, of the cross, and in this manner horned, He does now, on the one
hand, “toss” universal nations through faith, wafting them away from earth to heaven; and
will one day, on the other, “toss” them through judgment, casting them down from heaven
to earth.</p>
<p>He, again, will be the “bull” elsewhere too in the same scripture.1332 When Jacob pronounced
a blessing on Simeon and Levi, he prophesies of the scribes and Pharisees; for from

them1333 is derived their1334 origin. For (his blessing) interprets spiritually thus: “Simeon
and Levi perfected iniquity out of their sect,”1335—whereby, to wit, they persecuted Christ:
“into their counsel come not my soul! and upon their station rest not my heart! because in
their indignation they slew men”—that is, prophets—“and in their concupiscence they
hamstrung a bull!”1336—that is, Christ, whom—after the slaughter of prophets—they slew,
and exhausted their savagery by transfixing His sinews with nails. Else it is idle if, after the
murder already committed by them, he upbraids others, and not them, with butchery.1337</p>
<p>But, to come now to Moses, why, I wonder, did he merely at the time when Joshua was
battling against Amalek, pray sitting with hands expanded, when, in circumstances so crit-
ical, he ought rather, surely, to have commended his prayer by knees bended, and hands
beating his breast, and a face prostrate on the ground; except it was that there, where the
name of the Lord Jesus was the theme of speech—destined as He was to enter the lists one
day singly against the devil—the figure of the cross was also necessary, (that figure) through
which Jesus was to win the victory?1338 Why, again, did the same Moses, after the prohibition
of any “likeness of anything,”1339 set forth a brazen serpent, placed on a “tree,” in a hanging
posture, for a spectacle of healing to Israel, at the time when, after their idolatry,1340 they
were suffering extermination by serpents, except that in this case he was exhibiting the
Lord’s cross on which the “serpent” the devil was “made a show of,”1341 and, for every one
hurt by such snakes—that is, his angels1342—on turning intently from the peccancy of sins
to the sacraments of Christ’s cross, salvation was outwrought? For he who then gazed upon
that (cross) was freed from the bite of the serpents.1343</p>

<p>Come, now, if you have read in the utterance of the prophet in the Psalms, “God hath
reigned from the tree,”1344 I wait to hear what you understand thereby; for fear you may
perhaps think some carpenter-king1345 is signified, and not Christ, who has reigned from
that time onward when he overcame the death which ensued from His passion of “the tree.”</p>
<p>Similarly, again, Isaiah says: “For a child is born to us, and to us is given a son.”1346
What novelty is that, unless he is speaking of the “Son” of God?—and one is born to us the
beginning of whose government has been made “on His shoulder.” What king in the world
wears the ensign of his power on his shoulder, and does not bear either diadem on his head,
or else sceptre in his hand, or else some mark of distinctive vesture? But the novel “King of
ages,” Christ Jesus, alone reared “on His shoulder” His own novel glory, and power, and
sublimity,—the cross, to wit; that, according to the former prophecy, the Lord thenceforth
“might reign from the tree.” For of this tree likewise it is that God hints, through Jeremiah,
that you would say, “Come, let us put wood1347 into his bread, and let us wear him away out
of the land of the living; and his name shall no more be remembered.”1348 Of course on His
body that “wood” was put;1349 for so Christ has revealed, calling His body “bread,”1350
whose body the prophet in bygone days announced under the term “bread.” If you shall
still seek for predictions of the Lord’s cross, the twenty-first Psalm will at length be able to
satisfy you, containing as it does the whole passion of Christ; singing, as He does, even at
so early a date, His own glory.1351 “They dug,” He says, “my hands and feet”1352—which is
the peculiar atrocity of the cross; and again when He implores the aid of the Father, “Save
me,” He says, “out of the mouth of the lion”—of course, of death—“and from the horn of
the unicorns my humility,”1353—from the ends, to wit, of the cross, as we have above shown;
which cross neither David himself suffered, nor any of the kings of the Jews: that you may
not think the passion of some other particular man is here prophesied than His who alone
was so signally crucified by the People.</p>

<p>Now, if the hardness of your heart shall persist in rejecting and deriding all these interpretations,
we will prove that it may suffice that the death of the Christ had been prophesied,
in order that, from the fact that the nature of the death had not been specified, it may be
understood to have been affected by means of the cross1354 and that the passion of the cross
is not to be ascribed to any but Him whose death was constantly being predicted. For I desire
to show, in one utterance of Isaiah, His death, and passion, and sepulture. “By the crimes,”
he says, “of my people was He led unto death; and I will give the evil for His sepulture, and
the rich for His death, because He did not wickedness, nor was guile found in his mouth;
and God willed to redeem His soul from death,”1355 and so forth. He says again, moreover:
“His sepulture hath been taken away from the midst.”1356 For neither was He buried except
He were dead, nor was His sepulture removed from the midst except through His resurrection.
Finally, he subjoins: “Therefore He shall have many for an heritage, and of many shall
He divide spoils:”1357 who else (shall so do) but He who “was born,” as we have above
shown?—“in return for the fact that His soul was delivered unto death?” For, the cause of
the favour accorded Him being shown,—in return, to wit, for the injury of a death which
had to be recompensed,—it is likewise shown that He, destined to attain these rewards because
of death, was to attain them after death—of course after resurrection. For that which happened
at His passion, that mid-day grew dark, the prophet Amos announces, saying, “And it shall
be,” he says, “in that day, saith the Lord, the sun shall set at mid-day, and the day of light
shall grow dark over the land: and I will convert your festive days into grief, and all your
canticles into lamentation; and I will lay upon your loins sackcloth, and upon every head
baldness; and I will make the grief like that for a beloved (son), and them that are with him
like a day of mourning.”1358 For that you would do thus at the beginning of the first month
of your new (years) even Moses prophesied, when he was foretelling that all the community
of the sons of Israel was1359 to immolate at eventide a lamb, and were to eat1360 this solemn
sacrifice of this day (that is, of the passover of unleavened bread) with bitterness;” and added
that “it was the passover of the Lord,”1361 that is, the passion of Christ. Which prediction

was thus also fulfilled, that “on the first day of unleavened bread”1362 you slew Christ;1363

<head>Chapter XI.—Further Proofs, from Ezekiel. Summary of the Prophetic Argument
Thus Far.</head>
<p>For, again, it is for these deserts of yours that Ezekiel announces your ruin as about to
come: and not only in this age1364—a ruin which has already befallen—but in the “day of
retribution,”1365 which will be subsequent. From which ruin none will be freed but he who
shall have been frontally sealed1366 with the passion of the Christ whom you have rejected.
For thus it is written: “And the Lord said unto me, Son of man, thou hast seen what the
elders of Israel do, each one of them in darkness, each in a hidden bed-chamber: because
they have said, The Lord seeth us not; the Lord hath derelinquished the earth. And He said
unto me, Turn thee again, and thou shalt see greater enormities which these do. And He
introduced me unto the thresholds of the gate of the house of the Lord which looketh unto
the north; and, behold, there, women sitting and bewailing Thammuz. And the Lord said
unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen? Is the house of Judah moderate, to do the enormities
which they have done? And yet thou art about to see greater affections of theirs. And He
introduced me into the inner shrine of the house of the Lord; and, behold, on the thresholds
of the house of the Lord, between the midst of the porch and between the midst of the altar,
1367 as it were twenty and five men have turned their backs unto the temple of the Lord,
and their faces over against the east; these were adoring the sun. And He said unto me, Seest
thou, son of man? Are such deeds trifles to the house of Judah, that they should do the
enormities which these have done? because they have filled up (the measure of) their impieties,
and, behold, are themselves, as it were, grimacing; I will deal with mine indignation,1368
mine eye shall not spare, neither will I pity; they shall cry out unto mine ears with a loud
voice, and I will not hear them, nay, I will not pity. And He cried into mine ears with a loud
voice, saying, The vengeance of this city is at hand; and each one had vessels of extermination
in his hand. And, behold, six men were coming toward the way of the high gate which was
looking toward the north, and each one’s double-axe of dispersion was in his hand: and one
man in the midst of them, clothed with a garment reaching to the feet,1369 and a girdle of
sapphire about his loins: and they entered, and took their stand close to the brazen altar.

And the glory of the God of Israel, which was over the house, in the open court of it,1370
ascended from the cherubim: and the Lord called the man who was clothed with the garment
reaching to the feet, who had upon his loins the girdle; and said unto him, Pass through the
midst of Jerusalem, and write the sign Tau1371 on the foreheads of the men who groan and
grieve over all the enormities which are done in their midst. And while these things were
doing, He said unto an hearer,1372 Go ye after him into the city, and cut short; and spare
not with your eyes, and pity not elder or youth or virgin; and little ones and women slay ye
all, that they may be thoroughly wiped away; but all upon whom is the sign Tau approach
ye not; and begin with my saints.”1373 Now the mystery of this “sign” was in various ways
predicted; (a “sign”) in which the foundation of life was forelaid for mankind; (a “sign”) in
which the Jews were not to believe: just as Moses beforetime kept on announcing in Exodus,
1374 saying, “Ye shall be ejected from the land into which ye shall enter; and in those
nations ye shall not be able to rest: and there shall be instability of the print1375 of thy foot:
and God shall give thee a wearying heart, and a pining soul, and failing eyes, that they see
not: and thy life shall hang on the tree1376 before thine eyes; and thou shalt not trust thy
life.”</p>
<p>And so, since prophecy has been fulfilled through His advent—that is, through the
nativity, which we have above commemorated, and the passion, which we have evidently
explained—that is the reason withal why Daniel said, “Vision and prophet were sealed;”
because Christ is the “signet” of all prophets, fulfilling all that had in days bygone been announced
concerning Him: for, since His advent and personal passion, there is no longer
“vision” or “prophet;” whence most emphatically he says that His advent “seals vision and
prophecy.” And thus, by showing “the number of the years, and the time of the lxii and an
half fulfilled hebdomads,” we have proved that at that specified time Christ came, that is,
was born; and, (by showing the time) of the “seven and an half hebdomads,” which are
subdivided so as to be cut off from the former hebdomads, within which times we have

and the extermination of the city, (we have proved) that “sacrifice and unction” thenceforth
cease.</p>
<p>Sufficient it is thus far, on these points, to have meantime traced the course of the ordained
path of Christ, by which He is proved to be such as He used to be announced, even
on the ground of that agreement of Scriptures, which has enabled us to speak out, in opposition
to the Jews, on the ground1377 of the prejudgment of the major part. For let them not
question or deny the writings we produce; that the fact also that things which were foretold
as destined to happen after Christ are being recognised as fulfilled may make it impossible
for them to deny (these writings) to be on a par with divine Scriptures. Else, unless He were
come after whom the things which were wont to be announced had to be accomplished,
would such as have been completed be proved?1378</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Further Proofs from the Calling of the Gentiles.</head>
<p>Look at the universal nations thenceforth emerging from the vortex of human error to
the Lord God the Creator and His Christ; and if you dare to deny that this was prophesied,
forthwith occurs to you the promise of the Father in the Psalms, which says, “My Son art
Thou; to-day have I begotten Thee. Ask of Me, and I will give Thee Gentiles as Thine heritage,
and as Thy possession the bounds of the earth.”1379 For you will not be able to affirm
that “son” to be David rather than Christ; or the “bounds of the earth” to have been promised
rather to David, who reigned within the single (country of) Judea, than to Christ, who has
already taken captive the whole orb with the faith of His gospel; as He says through Isaiah:
“Behold, I have given Thee for a covenant1380 of my family, for a light of Gentiles, that Thou
mayst open the eyes of the blind”—of course, such as err—“to outloose from bonds the
bound”—that is, to free them from sins—“and from the house of prison”—that is, of
death—“such as sit in darkness”1381—of ignorance, to wit. And if these blessings accrue
through Christ, they will not have been prophesied of another than Him through whom we
consider them to have been accomplished.1382</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—Argument from the Destruction of Jerusalem and Desolation of
Judea.</head>
<p>Therefore, since the sons of Israel affirm that we err in receiving the Christ, who is
already come, let us put in a demurrer against them out of the Scriptures themselves, to the
effect that the Christ who was the theme of prediction is come; albeit by the times of Daniel’s
prediction we have proved that the Christ is come already who was the theme of announcement.
Now it behoved Him to be born in Bethlehem of Judah. For thus it is written in the
prophet: “And thou, Bethlehem, are not the least in the leaders of Judah: for out of thee shall
issue a Leader who shall feed my People Israel.”1383 But if hitherto he has not been born,
what “leader” was it who was thus announced as to proceed from the tribe of Judah, out of
Bethlehem? For it behoves him to proceed from the tribe of Judah and from Bethlehem.
But we perceive that now none of the race of Israel has remained in Bethlehem; and (so it
has been) ever since the interdict was issued forbidding any one of the Jews to linger in the
confines of the very district, in order that this prophetic utterance also should be perfectly
fulfilled: “Your land is desert, your cities burnt up by fire,”—that is, (he is foretelling) what
will have happened to them in time of war “your region strangers shall eat up in your sight,
and it shall be desert and subverted by alien peoples.”1384 And in another place it is thus
said through the prophet: “The King with His glory ye shall see,”—that is, Christ, doing
deeds of power in the glory of God the Father;1385 “and your eyes shall see the land from
afar,”1386—which is what you do, being prohibited, in reward of your deserts, since the
storming of Jerusalem, to enter into your land; it is permitted you merely to see it with your
eyes from afar: “your soul,” he says, “shall meditate terror,”1387—namely, at the time when
they suffered the ruin of themselves.1388 How, therefore, will a “leader” be born from Judea,
and how far will he “proceed from Bethlehem,” as the divine volumes of the prophets do
plainly announce; since none at all is left there to this day of (the house of) Israel, of whose
stock Christ could be born?</p>
<p>Now, if (according to the Jews) He is hitherto not come, when He begins to come whence
will He be anointed?1389 For the Law enjoined that, in captivity, it was not lawful for the

unction of the royal chrism to be compounded.1390 But, if there is no longer “unction”
there1391 as Daniel prophesied (for he says, “Unction shall be exterminated”), it follows that
they1392 no longer have it, because neither have they a temple where was the “horn”1393
from which kings were wont to be anointed. If, then, there is no unction, whence shall be
anointed the “leader” who shall be born in Bethlehem? or how shall he proceed “from
Bethlehem,” seeing that of the seed of Israel none at all exists in Bethlehem.</p>
<p>A second time, in fact, let us show that Christ is already come, (as foretold) through the
prophets, and has suffered, and is already received back in the heavens, and thence is to
come accordingly as the predictions prophesied. For, after His advent, we read, according
to Daniel, that the city itself had to be exterminated; and we recognise that so it has befallen.
For the Scripture says thus, that “the city and the holy place are simultaneously exterminated
together with the leader,”1394—undoubtedly (that Leader) who was to proceed “from
Bethlehem,” and from the tribe of “Judah.” Whence, again, it is manifest that “the city must
simultaneously be exterminated” at the time when its “Leader” had to suffer in it, (as foretold)
through the Scriptures of the prophets, who say: “I have outstretched my hands the whole
day unto a People contumacious and gainsaying Me, who walketh in a way not good, but
after their own sins.”1395 And in the Psalms, David says: “They exterminated my hands and
feet: they counted all my bones; they themselves, moreover, contemplated and saw me, and
in my thirst slaked me with vinegar.”1396 These things David did not suffer, so as to seem
justly to have spoken of himself; but the Christ who was crucified. Moreover, the “hands
and feet,” are not “exterminated,”1397 except His who is suspended on a “tree.” Whence,
again, David said that “the Lord would reign from the tree:”1398 for elsewhere, too, the
prophet predicts the fruit of this “tree,” saying “The earth hath given her blessings,”1399—of

course that virgin-earth, not yet irrigated with rains, nor fertilized by showers, out of which
man was of yore first formed, out of which now Christ through the flesh has been born of
a virgin; “and the tree,”1400 he says, “hath brought his fruit,”1401—not that “tree” in paradise
which yielded death to the protoplasts, but the “tree” of the passion of Christ, whence life,
hanging, was by you not believed!1402 For this “tree” in a mystery,1403 it was of yore
wherewith Moses sweetened the bitter water; whence the People, which was perishing of
thirst in the desert, drank and revived;1404 just as we do, who, drawn out from the calamities
of the heathendom1405 in which we were tarrying perishing with thirst (that is, deprived of
the divine word), drinking, “by the faith which is on Him,”1406 the baptismal water of the
“tree” of the passion of Christ, have revived,—a faith from which Israel has fallen away, (as
foretold) through Jeremiah, who says, “Send, and ask exceedingly whether such things have
been done, whether nations will change their gods (and these are not gods!). But My People
hath changed their glory: whence no profit shall accrue to them: the heaven turned pale
thereat” (and when did it turn pale? undoubtedly when Christ suffered), “and shuddered,”
he says, “most exceedingly;”1407 and “the sun grew dark at mid-day:”1408 (and when did it
“shudder exceedingly” except at the passion of Christ, when the earth also trembled to her
centre, and the veil of the temple was rent, and the tombs were burst asunder?1409 “because
these two evils hath My People done; Me,” He says, “they have quite forsaken, the fount of
water of life,1410 and they have digged for themselves worn-out tanks, which will not be
able to contain water.” Undoubtedly, by not receiving Christ, the “fount of water of life,”
they have begun to have “worn-out tanks,” that is, synagogues for the use of the “dispersions
of the Gentiles,”1411 in which the Holy Spirit no longer lingers, as for the time past He was
wont to tarry in the temple before the advent of Christ, who is the true temple of God. For,

that they should withal suffer this thirst of the Divine Spirit, the prophet Isaiah had said,
saying: “Behold, they who serve Me shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; they who serve Me
shall drink, but ye shall thirst, and from general tribulation of spirit shall howl: for ye shall
transmit your name for a satiety to Mine elect, but you the Lord shall slay; but for them who

<p>Again, the mystery of this “tree”1413 we read as being celebrated even in the Books of
the Reigns. For when the sons of the prophets were cutting “wood”1414 with axes on the
bank of the river Jordan, the iron flew off and sank in the stream; and so, on Elisha1415 the
prophet’s coming up, the sons of the prophets beg of him to extract from the stream the
iron which had sunk. And accordingly Elisha, having taken “wood,” and cast it into that
place where the iron had been submerged, forthwith it rose and swam on the surface,1416
and the “wood” sank, which the sons of the prophets recovered.1417 Whence they understood
that Elijah’s spirit was presently conferred upon him.1418 What is more manifest than the
mystery1419 of this “wood,”—that the obduracy of this world1420 had been sunk in the
profundity of error, and is freed in baptism by the “wood” of Christ, that is, of His passion;
in order that what had formerly perished through the “tree” in Adam, should be restored
through the “tree” in Christ?1421 while we, of course, who have succeeded to, and occupy,
the room of the prophets, at the present day sustain in the world1422 that treatment which
the prophets always suffered on account of divine religion: for some they stoned, some they
banished; more, however, they delivered to mortal slaughter,1423—a fact which they cannot
deny.1424</p>

<p>This “wood,” again, Isaac the son of Abraham personally carried for his own sacrifice,
when God had enjoined that he should be made a victim to Himself. But, because these had
been mysteries1425 which were being kept for perfect fulfilment in the times of Christ, Isaac,
on the one hand, with his “wood,” was reserved, the ram being offered which was caught
by the horns in the bramble;1426 Christ, on the other hand, in His times, carried His “wood”
on His own shoulders, adhering to the horns of the cross, with a thorny crown encircling
His head. For Him it behoved to be made a sacrifice on behalf of all Gentiles, who “was led
as a sheep for a victim, and, like a lamb voiceless before his shearer, so opened not His
mouth” (for He, when Pilate interrogated Him, spake nothing1427); for “in humility His
judgment was taken away: His nativity, moreover, who shall declare?” Because no one at
all of human beings was conscious of the nativity of Christ at His conception, when as the
Virgin Mary was found pregnant by the word of God; and because “His life was to be taken
from the land.”1428 Why, accordingly, after His resurrection from the dead, which was effected
on the third day, did the heavens receive Him back? It was in accordance with a
prophecy of Hosea, uttered on this wise: “Before daybreak shall they arise unto Me, saying,
Let us go and return unto the Lord our God, because Himself will draw us out and free us.
After a space of two days, on the third day”1429—which is His glorious resurrection—He
received back into the heavens (whence withal the Spirit Himself had come to the Virgin1430)
Him whose nativity and passion alike the Jews have failed to acknowledge. Therefore, since
the Jews still contend that the Christ is not yet come, whom we have in so many ways approved1431
to be come, let the Jews recognise their own fate,—a fate which they were constantly
foretold as destined to incur after the advent of the Christ, on account of the impiety
with which they despised and slew Him. For first, from the day when, according to the
saying of Isaiah, “a man cast forth his abominations of gold and silver, which they made to
adore with vain and hurtful (rites),”1432—that is, ever since we Gentiles, with our breast
doubly enlightened through Christ’s truth, cast forth (let the Jews see it) our idols,—what
follows has likewise been fulfilled. For “the Lord of Sabaoth hath taken away, among the
Jews from Jerusalem,” among the other things named, “the wise architect” too,1433 who

builds the church, God’s temple, and the holy city, and the house of the Lord. For thenceforth
God’s grace desisted (from working) among them. And “the clouds were commanded not
to rain a shower upon the vineyard of Sorek,”1434—the clouds being celestial benefits, which
were commanded not to be forthcoming to the house of Israel; for it “had borne
thorns”—whereof that house of Israel had wrought a crown for Christ—and not “righteousness,
but a clamour,”—the clamour whereby it had extorted His surrender to the cross.1435
And thus, the former gifts of grace being withdrawn, “the law and the prophets were until
John,”1436 and the fishpool of Bethsaida1437 until the advent of Christ: thereafter it ceased
curatively to remove from Israel infirmities of health; since, as the result of their perseverance
in their frenzy, the name of the Lord was through them blasphemed, as it is written: “On
your account the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles:”1438 for it is from them
that the infamy (attached to that name) began, and (was propagated during) the interval
from Tiberius to Vespasian. And because they had committed these crimes, and had failed
to understand that Christ “was to be found”1439 in “the time of their visitation,”1440 their
land has been made “desert, and their cities utterly burnt with fire, while strangers devour
their region in their sight: the daughter of Sion is derelict, as a watch-tower in a vineyard,
or as a shed in a cucumber garden,”—ever since the time, to wit, when “Israel knew not”
the Lord, and “the People understood Him not;” but rather “quite forsook, and provoked
unto indignation, the Holy One of Israel.”1441 So, again, we find a conditional threat of the
sword: “If ye shall have been unwilling, and shall not have been obedient, the glaive shall
eat you up.”1442 Whence we prove that the sword was Christ, by not hearing whom they
perished; who, again, in the Psalm, demands of the Father their dispersion, saying, “Disperse
them in Thy power;”1443 who, withal, again through Isaiah prays for their utter burning.
“On My account,” He says, “have these things happened to you; in anxiety shall ye sleep.”1444</p>

<p>Since, therefore, the Jews were predicted as destined to suffer these calamities on Christ’s
account, and we find that they have suffered them, and see them sent into dispersion and
abiding in it, manifest it is that it is on Christ’s account that these things have befallen the
Jews, the sense of the Scriptures harmonizing with the issue of events and of the order of
the times. Or else, if Christ is not yet come, on whose account they were predicted as destined
thus to suffer, when He shall have come it follows that they will thus suffer. And where will
then be a daughter of Sion to be derelict, who now has no existence? where the cities to be
exust, which are already exust and in heaps? where the dispersion of a race which is now in
exile? Restore to Judea the condition which Christ is to find; and (then, if you will), contend

<head>Chapter XIV.—Conclusion. Clue to the Error of the Jews.</head>
<p>Learn now (over and above the immediate question) the clue to your error. We affirm,
two characters of the Christ demonstrated by the prophets, and as many advents of His
forenoted: one, in humility (of course the first), when He has to be led “as a sheep for a
victim; and, as a lamb voiceless before the shearer, so He opened not His mouth,” not even
in His aspect comely. For “we have announced,” says the prophet, “concerning Him, (He
is) as a little child, as a root in a thirsty land; and there was not in Him attractiveness or
glory. And we saw Him, and He had not attractiveness or grace; but His mien was unhonoured,
deficient in comparison of the sons of men,”1445 “a man set in the plague,1446 and
knowing how to bear infirmity:” to wit as having been set by the Father “for a stone of offence,”
1447 and “made a little lower” by Him “than angels,”1448 He pronounces Himself “a
worm, and not a man, an ignominy of man, and the refuse of the People.”1449 Which evidences
of ignobility suit the First Advent, just as those of sublimity do the Second; when He
shall be made no longer “a stone of offence nor a rock of scandal,” but “the highest cornerstone,”
1450 after reprobation (on earth) taken up (into heaven) and raised sublime for the
purpose of consummation,1451 and that “rock”—so we must admit—which is read of in
Daniel as forecut from a mount, which shall crush and crumble the image of secular kingdoms.
1452 Of which second advent of the same (Christ) Daniel has said: “And, behold, as
it were a Son of man, coming with the clouds of the heaven, came unto the Ancient of days,
and was present in His sight; and they who were standing by led (Him) unto Him. And
there was given Him royal power; and all nations of the earth, according to their race, and
all glory, shall serve Him: and His power is eternal, which shall not be taken away, and His
kingdom one which shall not be corrupted.”1453 Then, assuredly, is He to have an honourable
mien, and a grace not “deficient more than the sons of men;” for (He will then be) “blooming
in beauty in comparison with the sons of men.”1454 “Grace,” says the Psalmist, “hath been
outpoured in Thy lips: wherefore God hath blessed Thee unto eternity. Gird Thee Thy sword

around Thy thigh, most potent in Thy bloom and beauty!”1455 while the Father withal afterwards,
after making Him somewhat lower than angels, “crowned Him with glory and honour
and subjected all things beneath His feet.”1456 And then shall they “learn to know Him
whom they pierced, and shall beat their breasts tribe by tribe;”1457 of course because in days
bygone they did not know Him when conditioned in the humility of human estate. Jeremiah
says: “He is a human being, and who will learn to know Him?”1458 because, “His nativity,”
says Isaiah, “who shall declare?” So, too, in Zechariah, in His own person, nay, in the very
mystery1459 of His name withal, the most true Priest of the Father, His own1460 Christ, is
delineated in a twofold garb with reference to the two advents.1461 First, He was clad in
“sordid attire,” that is, in the indignity of passible and mortal flesh, when the devil, withal,
was opposing himself to Him—the instigator, to wit, of Judas the traitor1462—who even
after His baptism had tempted Him. In the next place, He was stripped of His former sordid
raiment, and adorned with a garment down to the foot, and with a turban and a clean mitre,
that is, (with the garb) of the second advent; since He is demonstrated as having attained
“glory and honour.” Nor will you be able to say that the man (there depicted) is “the son of
Jozadak,”1463 who was never at all clad in a sordid garment, but was always adorned with
the sacerdotal garment, nor ever deprived of the sacerdotal function. But the “Jesus”1464
there alluded to is Christ, the Priest of God the most high Father; who at His first advent
came in humility, in human form, and passible, even up to the period of His passion; being
Himself likewise made, through all (stages of suffering) a victim for us all; who after His
resurrection was “clad with a garment down to the foot,”1465 and named the Priest of God

the Father unto eternity.1466 So, again, I will make an interpretation of the two goats which
were habitually offered on the fast-day.1467 Do not they, too, point to each successive stage
in the character of the Christ who is already come? A pair, on the one hand, and consimilar
(they were), because of the identity of the Lord’s general appearance, inasmuch as He is not
to come in some other form, seeing that He has to be recognised by those by whom He was
once hurt. But the one of them, begirt with scarlet, amid cursing and universal spitting, and
tearing, and piercing, was cast away by the People outside the city into perdition, marked
with manifest tokens of Christ’s passion; who, after being begirt with scarlet garment, and
subjected to universal spitting, and afflicted with all contumelies, was crucified outside the
city.1468 The other, however, offered for sins, and given as food to the priests merely of the
temple,1469 gave signal evidences of the second appearance; in so far as, after the expiation
of all sins, the priests of the spiritual temple, that is, of the church, were to enjoy1470 a spiritual
public distribution (as it were) of the Lord’s grace, while all others are fasting from
salvation.</p>
<p>Therefore, since the vaticinations of the first advent obscured it with manifold figures,
and debased it with every dishonour, while the second (was foretold as) manifest and wholly
worthy of God, it has resulted therefrom, that, by fixing their gaze on that one alone which
they could easily understand and believe (that is, the second, which is in honour and glory),
they have been (not undeservedly) deceived as to the more obscure—at all events, the more
unworthy—that is, the first. And thus to the present moment they affirm that their Christ
is not come, because He is not come in majesty; while they are ignorant of1471 the fact that
He was first to come in humility.</p>
<p>Enough it is, meantime, to have thus far followed the stream downward of the order of
Christ’s course, whereby He is proved such as He was habitually announced: in order that,
as a result of this harmony of the Divine Scriptures, we may understand; and that the events
which used to be predicted as destined to take place after Christ may be believed to have
been accomplished as the result of a divine arrangement. For unless He come after whom
they had to be accomplished, by no means would the events, the future occurrence whereof
was predictively assigned to His advent, have come to pass. Therefore, if you see universal
nations thenceforth emerging from the profundity of human error to God the Creator and

His Christ (which you dare not assert to have not been prophesied, because, albeit you were
so to assert, there would forthwith—as we have already premised1472—occur to you the
promise of the Father saying, “My Son art Thou; I this day have begotten Thee; ask of Me,
and I will give Thee Gentiles as Thine heritage, and as Thy possession the boundaries of the
earth.” Nor will you be able to vindicate, as the subject of that prediction, rather the son of
David, Solomon, than Christ, God’s Son; nor “the boundaries of the earth,” as promised
rather to David’s son, who reigned within the single land of Judea, than to Christ the Son
of God, who has already illumined the whole world1473 with the rays of His gospel. In short,
again, a throne “unto the age”1474 is more suitable to Christ, God’s Son, than to Solomon,—a
temporal king, to wit, who reigned over Israel alone. For at the present day nations are invoking
Christ which used not to know Him; and peoples at the present day are fleeing in a
body to the Christ of whom in days bygone they were ignorant1475), you cannot contend
that is future which you see taking place.1476 Either deny that these events were prophesied,
while they are seen before your eyes; or else have been fulfilled, while you hear them read:
or, on the other hand, if you fail to deny each position, they will have their fulfilment in

The Soul’s Testimony.1477</head>
<p>[Translated by the Rev. S. Thelwall.]</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>Chapter I.</head>
<p>If, with the object of convicting the rivals and persecutors of Christian truth, from their
own authorities, of the crime of at once being untrue to themselves and doing injustice to
us, one is bent on gathering testimonies in its favour from the writings of the philosophers,
or the poets, or other masters of this world’s learning and wisdom, he has need of a most
inquisitive spirit, and a still greater memory to carry out the research. Indeed, some of our
people, who still continued their inquisitive labours in ancient literature, and still occupied
memory with it, have published works we have in our hands of this very sort; works in which
they relate and attest the nature and origin of their traditions, and the grounds on which
opinions rest, and from which it may be seen at once that we have embraced nothing new
or monstrous—nothing for which we cannot claim the support of ordinary and well-known
writings, whether in ejecting error from our creed, or admitting truth into it. But the unbelieving
hardness of the human heart leads them to slight even their own teachers, otherwise
approved and in high renown, whenever they touch upon arguments which are used in defence
of Christianity. Then the poets are fools, when they describe the gods with human
passions and stories; then the philosophers are without reason, when they knock at the gates
of truth. He will thus far be reckoned a wise and sagacious man who has gone the length
of uttering sentiments that are almost Christian; while if, in a mere affectation of judgment
and wisdom, he sets himself to reject their ceremonies, or to convicting the world of its sin,
he is sure to be branded as a Christian. We will have nothing, then, to do with the literature
and the teaching, perverted in its best results, which is believed in its errors rather than its
truth. We shall lay no stress on it, if some of their authors have declared that there is one
God, and one God only. Nay, let it be granted that there is nothing in heathen writers which
<note type="footnote">1477 [The tract De Testimonio Animæ is cast into an apologetic form and very properly comes into place
here. It was written in Orthodoxy and forms a valuable preface to the De Anima, of which we cannot say that
it is quite free from errors. As it refers to the Apology, we cannot place it before that work, and perhaps we shall
not greatly err if we consider it a sequel to the Apology. If it proves to others the source of as much enjoyment
as it affords to me, it will be treasured by them as one of the most precious testimonies to the Gospel, introducing
Man to himself.]</note>

a Christian approves, that it may be put out of his power to utter a single word of reproach.
For all are not familiar with their teachings; and those who are, have no assurance in regard
to their truth. Far less do men assent to our writings, to which no one comes for guidance
unless he is already a Christian. I call in a new testimony, yea, one which is better known
than all literature, more discussed than all doctrine, more public than all publications,
greater than the whole man—I mean all which is man’s. Stand forth, O soul, whether thou
art a divine and eternal substance, as most philosophers believe if it be so, thou wilt be the
less likely to lie,—or whether thou art the very opposite of divine, because indeed a mortal
thing, as Epicurus alone thinks—in that case there will be the less temptation for thee to
speak falsely in this case: whether thou art received from heaven, or sprung from earth;
whether thou art formed of numbers, or of atoms; whether thine existence begins with that
of the body, or thou art put into it at a later stage; from whatever source, and in whatever
way, thou makest man a rational being, in the highest degree capable of thought and
knowledge,—stand forth and give thy witness. But I call thee not as when, fashioned in
schools, trained in libraries, fed in Attic academies and porticoes, thou belchest wisdom. I
address thee simple, rude, uncultured and untaught, such as they have thee who have thee
only; that very thing of the road, the street, the work-shop, wholly. I want thine inexperience,
since in thy small experience no one feels any confidence. I demand of thee the things thou
bringest with thee into man, which thou knowest either from thyself, or from thine author,
whoever he may be. Thou art not, as I well know, Christian; for a man becomes a Christian,
he is not born one. Yet Christians earnestly press thee for a testimony; they press thee,
though an alien, to bear witness against thy friends, that they may be put to shame before
thee, for hating and mocking us on account of things which convict thee as an accessory.</p>

<p>We give offence by proclaiming that there is one God, to whom the name of God alone
belongs, from whom all things come, and who is Lord of the whole universe.1478 Bear thy
testimony, if thou knowest this to be the truth; for openly and with a perfect liberty, such
as we do not possess, we hear thee both in private and in public exclaim, “Which may God
grant,” and, “If God so will.” By expressions such as these thou declarest that there is one
who is distinctively God, and thou confessest that all power belongs to him to whose will,
as Sovereign, thou dost look. At the same time, too, thou deniest any others to be truly gods,
in calling them by their own names of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Minerva; for thou affirmest
Him to be God alone to whom thou givest no other name than God; and though thou
sometimes callest these others gods, thou plainly usest the designation as one which does
not really belong to them, but is, so to speak, a borrowed one. Nor is the nature of the God
we declare unknown to thee: “God is good, God does good,” thou art wont to say; plainly
suggesting further, “But man is evil.” In asserting an antithetic proposition, thou, in a sort
of indirect and figurative way, reproachest man with his wickedness in departing from a
God so good. So, again, as among us, as belonging to the God of benignity and goodness,
“Blessing” is a most sacred act in our religion and our life, thou too sayest as readily as a
Christian needs, “God bless thee;” and when thou turnest the blessing of God into a curse,
in like manner thy very words confess with us that His power over us is absolute and entire.
There are some who, though they do not deny the existence of God, hold withal that He is
neither Searcher, nor Ruler, nor Judge; treating with especial disdain those of us who go
over to Christ out of fear of a coming judgment, as they think, honouring God in freeing
Him from the cares of keeping watch, and the trouble of taking note,—not even regarding
Him as capable of anger. For if God, they say, gets angry, then He is susceptible of corruption
and passion; but that of which passion and corruption can be affirmed may also perish,
which God cannot do. But these very persons elsewhere, confessing that the soul is divine,
and bestowed on us by God, stumble against a testimony of the soul itself, which affords an
answer to these views. For if either divine or God-given, it doubtless knows its giver; and if
it knows Him, it undoubtedly fears Him too, and especially as having been by Him endowed
so amply. Has it no fear of Him whose favour it is so desirous to possess, and whose anger
it is so anxious to avoid? Whence, then, the soul’s natural fear of God, if God cannot be
angry? How is there any dread of Him whom nothing offends? What is feared but anger?
Whence comes anger, but from observing what is done? What leads to watchful oversight,
but judgment in prospect? Whence is judgment, but from power? To whom does supreme
authority and power belong, but to God alone? So thou art always ready, O soul, from thine

sees all,” and “I commend thee to God,” and “May God repay,” and “God shall judge between
us.” How happens this, since thou art not Christian? How is it that, even with the garland
of Ceres on the brow, wrapped in the purple cloak of Saturn, wearing the white robe of the
goddess Isis, thou invokest God as judge? Standing under the statue of Æsculapius, adorning
the brazen image of Juno, arraying the helmet of Minerva with dusky figures, thou never
thinkest of appealing to any of these deities. In thine own forum thou appealest to a God
who is elsewhere; thou permittest honour to be rendered in thy temples to a foreign god.

Christians!</p>

<p>But when we say that there are demons—as though, in the simple fact that we alone
expel them from the men’s bodies,1479 we did not also prove their existence—some disciple
of Chrysippus begins to curl the lip. Yet thy curses sufficiently attest that there are such beings,
and that they are objects of thy strong dislike.1480 As what comes to thee as a fit expression
of thy strong hatred of him, thou callest the man a dæmon who annoys thee with his
filthiness, or malice, or insolence, or any other vice which we ascribe to evil spirits. In expressing
vexation, contempt, or abhorrence, thou hast Satan constantly upon thy lips;1481
the very same we hold to be the angel of evil, the source of error, the corrupter of the whole
world, by whom in the beginning man was entrapped into breaking the commandment of
God. And (the man) being given over to death on account of his sin, the entire human race,
tainted in their descent from him, were made a channel for transmitting his condemnation.
Thou seest, then, thy destroyer; and though he is fully known only to Christians, or to
whatever sect1482 confesses the Lord, yet, even thou hast some acquaintance with him while
yet thou abhorrest him!</p>

<p>Even now, as the matter refers to thy opinion on a point the more closely belonging to
thee, in so far as it bears on thy personal well-being, we maintain that after life has passed
away thou still remainest in existence, and lookest forward to a day of judgment, and according
to thy deserts art assigned to misery or bliss, in either way of it for ever; that, to be capable
of this, thy former substance must needs return to thee, the matter and the memory of the
very same human being: for neither good nor evil couldst thou feel if thou wert not endowed
again with that sensitive bodily organization, and there would be no grounds for judgment
without the presentation of the very person to whom the sufferings of judgment were due.
That Christian view, though much nobler than the Pythagorean, as it does not transfer thee
into beasts; though more complete than the Platonic, since it endows thee again with a body;
though more worthy of honour than the Epicurean, as it preserves thee from annihilation,—
yet, because of the name connected with it, it is held to be nothing but vanity and
folly, and, as it is called, a mere presumption. But we are not ashamed of ourselves if our
presumption is found to have thy support. Well, in the first place, when thou speakest of
one who is dead, thou sayest of him, “Poor man”—poor, surely, not because he has been
taken from the good of life, but because he has been given over to punishment and condemnation.
But at another time thou speakest of the dead as free from trouble; thou professest
to think life a burden, and death a blessing. Thou art wont, too, to speak of the dead as in
repose,1483 when, returning to their graves beyond the city gates1484 with food and dainties,
thou art wont to present offerings to thyself rather than to them; or when, coming from the
graves again, thou art staggering under the effects of wine. But I want thy sober opinion.
Thou callest the dead poor when thou speakest thine own thoughts, when thou art at a distance
from them. For at their feast, where in a sense they are present and recline along with
thee, it would never do to cast reproach upon their lot. Thou canst not but adulate those
for whose sake thou art feasting it so sumptuously. Dost thou then speak of him as poor
who feels not? How happens it that thou cursest, as one capable of suffering from thy curse,
the man whose memory comes back on thee with the sting in it of some old injury? It is
thine imprecation that “the earth may lie heavy on him,” and that there may be trouble “to
his ashes in the realm of the dead.” In like manner, in thy kindly feeling to him to whom

relations with them in the Communion of Saints.]</note>

<pb n="372"/>
thou art indebted for favours, thou entreatest “repose to his bones and ashes,” and thy desire
is that among the dead he may “have pleasant rest.” If thou hast no power of suffering after
death, if no feeling remains,—if, in a word, severance from the body is the annihilation of
thee, what makes thee lie against thyself, as if thou couldst suffer in another state? Nay, why
dost thou fear death at all? There is nothing after death to be feared, if there is nothing to
be felt. For though it may be said that death is dreadful not for anything it threatens afterwards,
but because it deprives us of the good of life; yet, on the other hand, as it puts an end
to life’s discomforts, which are far more numerous, death’s terrors are mitigated by a gain
that more than outweighs the loss. And there is no occasion to be troubled about a loss of
good things, which is amply made up for by so great a blessing as relief from every trouble.
There is nothing dreadful in that which delivers from all that is to be dreaded. If thou
shrinkest from giving up life because thy experience of it has been sweet, at any rate there
is no need to be in any alarm about death if thou hast no knowledge that it is evil. Thy dread
of it is the proof that thou art aware of its evil. Thou wouldst never think it evil—thou
wouldst have no fear of it at all—if thou wert not sure that after it there is something to
make it evil, and so a thing of terror.1485 Let us leave unnoted at this time that natural way
of fearing death. It is a poor thing for any one to fear what is inevitable. I take up the other
side, and argue on the ground of a joyful hope beyond our term of earthly life; for desire of
posthumous fame is with almost every class an inborn thing.1486 I have not time to speak
of the Curtii, and the Reguli, or the brave men of Greece, who afford us innumerable cases
of death despised for after renown. Who at this day is without the desire that he may be often
remembered when he is dead? Who does not give all endeavour to preserve his name by
works of literature, or by the simple glory of his virtues, or by the splendour even of his
tomb? How is it the nature of the soul to have these posthumous ambitions and with such
amazing effort to prepare the things it can only use after decease? It would care nothing
about the future, if the future were quite unknown to it. But perhaps thou thinkest thyself
surer, after thy exit from the body, of continuing still to feel, than of any future resurrection,
which is a doctrine laid at our door as one of our presumptuous suppositions. But it is also
the doctrine of the soul; for if any one inquires about a person lately dead as though he were
alive, it occurs at once to say, “He has gone.” He is expected to return, then.</p>

<p>These testimonies of the soul are simple as true, commonplace as simple, universal as
commonplace, natural as universal, divine as natural. I don’t think they can appear frivolous
or feeble to any one, if he reflect on the majesty of nature, from which the soul derives its
authority.1487 If you acknowledge the authority of the mistress, you will own it also in the
disciple. Well, nature is the mistress here, and her disciple is the soul. But everything the
one has taught or the other learned, has come from God—the Teacher of the teacher. And
what the soul may know from the teachings of its chief instructor, thou canst judge from
that which is within thee. Think of that which enables thee to think; reflect on that which
in forebodings is the prophet, the augur in omens, the foreseer of coming events. Is it a
wonderful thing, if, being the gift of God to man, it knows how to divine? Is it anything very
strange, if it knows the God by whom it was bestowed? Even fallen as it is, the victim of the
great adversary’s machinations, it does not forget its Creator, His goodness and law, and
the final end both of itself and of its foe. Is it singular then, if, divine in its origin, its revelations
agree with the knowledge God has given to His own people? But he who does not regard
those outbursts of the soul as the teaching of a congenital nature and the secret deposit of
an inborn knowledge, will say that the habit and, so to say, the vice of speaking in this way
has been acquired and confirmed from the opinions of published books widely spread among
men. Unquestionably the soul existed before letters, and speech before books, and ideas
before the writing of them, and man himself before the poet and philosopher.1488 Is it then
to be believed, that before literature and its publication no utterances of the sort we have
pointed out came from the lips of men? Did nobody speak of God and His goodness, nobody
of death, nobody of the dead? Speech went a-begging, I suppose; nay, (the subjects being
still awanting, without which it cannot even exist at this day, when it is so much more copious,
and rich, and wise), it could not exist at all if the things which are now so easily suggested,
that cling to us so constantly, that are so very near to us, that are somehow born on our very
lips, had no existence in ancient times, before letters had any existence in the world—before
there was a Mercury, I think, at all. And whence was it, I pray, that letters themselves came
to know, and to disseminate for the use of speech, what no mind had ever conceived, or
tongue put forth, or ear taken in? But, clearly, since the Scriptures of God, whether belonging
to Christians or to Jews, into whose olive tree we have been grafted—are much more ancient
than any secular literature, (or, let us only say, are of a somewhat earlier date, as we have

shown in its proper place when proving their trustworthiness); if the soul have taken these
utterances from writings at all, we must believe it has taken them from ours, and not from
yours, its instruction coming more naturally from the earlier than the later works. Which
latter indeed waited for their own instruction from the former, and though we grant that
light has come from you, still it has flowed from the first fountainhead originally; and we
claim as entirely ours, all you may have taken from us and handed down. Since it is thus, it
matters little whether the soul’s knowledge was put into it by God or by His book. Why,
then, O man, wilt thou maintain a view so groundless, as that those testimonies of the soul
have gone forth from the mere human speculations of your literature, and got hardening
of common use?</p>

<p>Believe, then, your own books, and as to our Scriptures so much the more believe writings
which are divine, but in the witness of the soul itself give like confidence to Nature. Choose
the one of these you observe to be the most faithful friend of truth. If your own writings are
distrusted, neither God nor Nature lie. And if you would have faith in God and Nature, have
faith in the soul; thus you will believe yourself. Certainly you value the soul as giving you
your true greatness,—that to which you belong; which is all things to you; without which
you can neither live nor die; on whose account you even put God away from you. Since,
then, you fear to become a Christian, call the soul before you, and put her to the question.
Why does she worship another? why name the name of God? Why does she speak of demons,
when she means to denote spirits to be held accursed? Why does she make her protestations
towards the heavens, and pronounce her ordinary execrations earthwards? Why does she
render service in one place, in another invoke the Avenger? Why does she pass judgments
on the dead? What Christian phrases are those she has got, though Christians she neither
desires to see nor hear? Why has she either bestowed them on us, or received them from
us? Why has she either taught us them, or learned them as our scholar? Regard with suspicion
this accordance in words, while there is such difference in practice. It is utter folly—denying
a universal nature—to ascribe this exclusively to our language and the Greek, which are regarded
among us as so near akin. The soul is not a boon from heaven to Latins and Greeks
alone. Man is the one name belonging to every nation upon earth: there is one soul and
many tongues, one spirit and various sounds; every country has its own speech, but the
subjects of speech are common to all. God is everywhere, and the goodness of God is
everywhere; demons are everywhere, and the cursing of them is everywhere; the invocation
of divine judgment is everywhere, death is everywhere, and the sense of death is everywhere,
and all the world over is found the witness of the soul. There is not a soul of man that does
not, from the light that is in itself, proclaim the very things we are not permitted to speak
above our breath. Most justly, then, every soul is a culprit as well as a witness: in the measure
that it testifies for truth, the guilt of error lies on it; and on the day of judgment it will stand
before the courts of God, without a word to say. Thou proclaimedst God, O soul, but thou
didst not seek to know Him: evil spirits were detested by thee, and yet they were the objects
of thy adoration; the punishments of hell were foreseen by thee, but no care was taken to
avoid them; thou hadst a savour of Christianity, and withal wert the persecutor of Christians.</p>

who is willing and able to extend his care to all things, etc.” Now, it is a sublime plan which

<p>Having discussed with Hermogenes the single point of the origin of the soul, so far as
his assumption led me, that the soul consisted rather in an adaptation1491 of matter than
of the inspiration1492 of God, I now turn to the other questions incidental to the subject;
and (in my treatment of these) I shall evidently have mostly to contend with the philosophers.
In the very prison of Socrates they skirmished about the state of the soul. I have my doubts
at once whether the time was an opportune one for their (great) master—(to say nothing
of the place), although that perhaps does not much matter. For what could the soul of Socrates
then contemplate with clearness and serenity? The sacred ship had returned (from Delos),
the hemlock draft to which he had been condemned had been drunk, death was now present
before him: (his mind) was,1493 as one may suppose,1494 naturally excited1495 at every

<note type="footnote">1490 In this treatise we have Tertullian’s speculations on the origin, the nature, and the destiny of the human
soul. There are, no doubt, paradoxes startling to a modern reader to be found in it, such as that of the soul’s
corporeity; and there are weak and inconclusive arguments. But after all such drawbacks (and they are not more
than what constantly occur in the most renowned speculative writers of antiquity), the reader will discover many
interesting proofs of our author’s character for originality of thought, width of information, firm grasp of his
subject, and vivacious treatment of it, such as we have discovered in other parts of his writings. If his subject
permits Tertullian less than usual of an appeal to his favourite Holy Scripture, he still makes room for occasional
illustration from it, and with his characteristic ability; if, however, there is less of his sacred learning in it, the
treatise teems with curious information drawn from the secular literature of that early age. Our author often
measures swords with Plato in his discussions on the soul, and it is not too much to say that he shows himself
a formidable opponent to the great philosopher. See Bp. Kaye, On Tertullian, pp. 199, 200.</note>

emotion; or if nature had lost her influence, it must have been deprived of all power of
thought.1496 Or let it have been as placid and tranquil so you please, inflexible, in spite of
the claims of natural duty,1497 at the tears of her who was so soon to be his widow, and at
the sight of his thenceforward orphan children, yet his soul must have been moved even by
its very efforts to suppress emotion; and his constancy itself must have been shaken, as he
struggled against the disturbance of the excitement around him. Besides, what other thoughts
could any man entertain who had been unjustly condemned to die, but such as should solace
him for the injury done to him? Especially would this be the case with that glorious creature,
the philosopher, to whom injurious treatment would not suggest a craving for consolation,
but rather the feeling of resentment and indignation. Accordingly, after his sentence, when
his wife came to him with her effeminate cry, O Socrates, you are unjustly condemned! he
seemed already to find joy in answering, Would you then wish me justly condemned? It is
therefore not to be wondered at, if even in his prison, from a desire to break the foul hands
of Anytus and Melitus, he, in the face of death itself, asserts the immortality of the soul by
a strong assumption such as was wanted to frustrate the wrong (they had inflicted upon
him). So that all the wisdom of Socrates, at that moment, proceeded from the affectation of
an assumed composure, rather than the firm conviction of ascertained truth. For by whom
has truth ever been discovered without God? By whom has God ever been found without
Christ? By whom has Christ ever been explored without the Holy Spirit? By whom has the
Holy Spirit ever been attained without the mysterious gift of faith?1498 Socrates, as none
can doubt, was actuated by a different spirit. For they say that a demon clave to him from
his boyhood—the very worst teacher certainly, notwithstanding the high place assigned to
it by poets and philosophers—even next to, (nay, along with) the gods themselves. The
teachings of the power of Christ had not yet been given—(that power) which alone can
confute this most pernicious influence of evil that has nothing good in it, but is rather the
author of all error, and the seducer from all truth. Now if Socrates was pronounced the
wisest of men by the oracle of the Pythian demon, which, you may be sure, neatly managed
the business for his friend, of how much greater dignity and constancy is the assertion of
the Christian wisdom, before the very breath of which the whole host of demons is scattered!
This wisdom of the school of heaven frankly and without reserve denies the gods of this
world, and shows no such inconsistency as to order a “cock to be sacrificed to Æsculapius:”
1499 no new gods and demons does it introduce, but expels the old ones; it corrupts

condemnation not of one city only, but of all the world, in the cause of that truth which incurs
indeed the greater hatred in proportion to its fulness: so that it tastes death not out of a
(poisoned) cup almost in the way of jollity; but it exhausts it in every kind of bitter cruelty,
on gibbets and in holocausts.1500 Meanwhile, in the still gloomier prison of the world
amongst your Cebeses and Phædos, in every investigation concerning (man’s) soul, it directs
its inquiry according to the rules of God. At all events, you can show us no more powerful
expounder of the soul than the Author thereof. From God you may learn about that which
you hold of God; but from none else will you get this knowledge, if you get it not from God.
For who is to reveal that which God has hidden? To that quarter must we resort in our inquiries
whence we are most safe even in deriving our ignorance. For it is really better for us
not to know a thing, because He has not revealed it to us, than to know it according to man’s
wisdom, because he has been bold enough to assume it.</p>

<p>Of course we shall not deny that philosophers have sometimes thought the same things
as ourselves. The testimony of truth is the issue thereof. It sometimes happens even in a
storm, when the boundaries of sky and sea are lost in confusion, that some harbour is
stumbled on (by the labouring ship) by some happy chance; and sometimes in the very
shades of night, through blind luck alone, one finds access to a spot, or egress from it. In
nature, however, most conclusions are suggested, as it were, by that common intelligence
wherewith God has been pleased to endow the soul of man. This intelligence has been caught
up by philosophy, and, with the view of glorifying her own art, has been inflated (it is not
to be wondered at that I use this language) with straining after that facility of language which
is practised in the building up and pulling down of everything, and which has greater aptitude
for persuading men by speaking than by teaching. She assigns to things their forms and
conditions; sometimes makes them common and public, sometimes appropriates them to
private use; on certainties she capriciously stamps the character of uncertainty; she appeals
to precedents, as if all things are capable of being compared together; she describes all things
by rule and definition, allotting diverse properties even to similar objects; she attributes
nothing to the divine permission, but assumes as her principles the laws of nature. I could
bear with her pretensions, if only she were herself true to nature, and would prove to me
that she had a mastery over nature as being associated with its creation. She thought, no
doubt, that she was deriving her mysteries from sacred sources, as men deem them, because
in ancient times most authors were supposed to be (I will not say godlike, but) actually gods:
as, for instance, the Egyptian Mercury,1501 to whom Plato paid very great deference;1502
and the Phrygian Silenus, to whom Midas lent his long ears, when the shepherds brought
him to him; and Hermotimus, to whom the good people of Clazomenæ built a temple after
his death; and Orpheus; and Musæus; and Pherecydes, the master of Pythagoras. But why
need we care, since these philosophers have also made their attacks upon those writings
which are condemned by us under the title of apocryphal,1503 certain as we are that nothing
ought to be received which does not agree with the true system of prophecy, which has

arisen in this present age;1504 because we do not forget that there have been false prophets,
and long previous to them fallen spirits, which have instructed the entire tone and aspect
of the world with cunning knowledge of this (philosophic) cast? It is, indeed, not incredible
that any man who is in quest of wisdom may have gone so far, as a matter of curiosity, as
to consult the very prophets; (but be this as it may), if you take the philosophers, you would
find in them more diversity than agreement, since even in their agreement their diversity
is discoverable. Whatever things are true in their systems, and agreeable to prophetic wisdom,
they either recommend as emanating from some other source, or else perversely apply1505
in some other sense. This process is attended with very great detriment to the truth, when
they pretend that it is either helped by falsehood, or else that falsehood derives support from
it. The following circumstance must needs have set ourselves and the philosophers by the
ears, especially in this present matter, that they sometimes clothe sentiments which are
common to both sides, in arguments which are peculiar to themselves, but contrary in some
points to our rule and standard of faith; and at other times defend opinions which are especially
their own, with arguments which both sides acknowledge to be valid, and occasionally
conformable to their system of belief. The truth has, at this rate, been well-nigh excluded
by the philosophers, through the poisons with which they have infected it; and thus, if we
regard both the modes of coalition which we have now mentioned, and which are equally
hostile to the truth, we feel the urgent necessity of freeing, on the one hand, the sentiments
held by us in common with them from the arguments of the philosophers, and of separating,
on the other hand, the arguments which both parties employ from the opinions of the same
philosophers. And this we may do by recalling all questions to God’s inspired standard, with
the obvious exception of such simple cases as being free from the entanglement of any preconceived
conceits, one may fairly admit on mere human testimony; because plain evidence
of this sort we must sometimes borrow from opponents, when our opponents have nothing
to gain from it. Now I am not unaware what a vast mass of literature the philosophers have
accumulated concerning the subject before us, in their own commentaries thereon—what
various schools of principles there are, what conflicts of opinion, what prolific sources of
questions, what perplexing methods of solution. Moreover, I have looked into Medical Science
also, the sister (as they say) of Philosophy, which claims as her function to cure the body,
and thereby to have a special acquaintance with the soul. From this circumstance she has
great differences with her sister, pretending as the latter does to know more about the soul,
through the more obvious treatment, as it were, of her in her domicile of the body. But
never mind all this contention between them for pre-eminence! For extending their several
researches on the soul, Philosophy, on the one hand, has enjoyed the full scope of her genius;

while Medicine, on the other hand, has possessed the stringent demands of her art and
practice. Wide are men’s inquiries into uncertainties; wider still are their disputes about
conjectures. However great the difficulty of adducing proofs, the labour of producing conviction
is not one whit less; so that the gloomy Heraclitus was quite right, when, observing
the thick darkness which obscured the researches of the inquirers about the soul, and
wearied with their interminable questions, he declared that he had certainly not explored
the limits of the soul, although he had traversed every road in her domains. To the Christian,
however, but few words are necessary for the clear understanding of the whole subject. But
in the few words there always arises certainty to him; nor is he permitted to give his inquiries
a wider range than is compatible with their solution; for “endless questions” the apostle
forbids.1506 It must, however, be added, that no solution may be found by any man, but
such as is learned from God; and that which is learned of God is the sum and substance of
the whole thing.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—The Soul’s Origin Defined Out of the Simple Words of Scripture.</head>
<p>Would to God that no “heresies had been ever necessary, in order that they which are
approved may be made manifest!”1507 We should then be never required to try our strength
in contests about the soul with philosophers, those patriarchs of heretics, as they may be
fairly called.1508 The apostle, so far back as his own time, foresaw, indeed, that philosophy
would do violent injury to the truth.1509 This admonition about false philosophy he was induced
to offer after he had been at Athens, had become acquainted with that loquacious
city,1510 and had there had a taste of its huckstering wiseacres and talkers. In like manner
is the treatment of the soul according to the sophistical doctrines of men which “mix their
wine with water.”1511 Some of them deny the immortality of the soul; others affirm that it
is immortal, and something more. Some raise disputes about its substance; others about its
form; others, again, respecting each of its several faculties. One school of philosophers derives
its state from various sources, while another ascribes its departure to different destinations.
The various schools reflect the character of their masters, according as they have received
their impressions from the dignity1512 of Plato, or the vigour1513 of Zeno, or the equanimity1514
of Aristotle, or the stupidity1515 of Epicurus, or the sadness1516 of Heraclitus, or the
madness1517 of Empedocles. The fault, I suppose, of the divine doctrine lies in its springing
from Judæa1518 rather than from Greece. Christ made a mistake, too, in sending forth
fishermen to preach, rather than the sophist. Whatever noxious vapours, accordingly, exhaled
from philosophy, obscure the clear and wholesome atmosphere of truth, it will be for
Christians to clear away, both by shattering to pieces the arguments which are drawn from
the principles of things—I mean those of the philosophers—and by opposing to them the
maxims of heavenly wisdom—that is, such as are revealed by the Lord; in order that both
the pitfalls wherewith philosophy captivates the heathen may be removed, and the means

employed by heresy to shake the faith of Christians may be repressed. We have already decided
one point in our controversy with Hermogenes, as we said at the beginning of this
treatise, when we claimed the soul to be formed by the breathing1519 of God, and not out
of matter. We relied even there on the clear direction of the inspired statement which informs
us how that “the Lord God breathed on man’s face the breath of life, so that man became a
living soul”1520—by that inspiration of God, of course. On this point, therefore, nothing
further need be investigated or advanced by us. It has its own treatise,1521 and its own heretic.

<head>Chapter IV.—In Opposition to Plato, the Soul Was Created and Originated at Birth.</head>
<p>After settling the origin of the soul, its condition or state comes up next. For when we
acknowledge that the soul originates in the breath of God, it follows that we attribute a beginning
to it. This Plato, indeed, refuses to assign to it, for he will have the soul to be unborn
and unmade.1522 We, however, from the very fact of its having had a beginning, as well as
from the nature thereof, teach that it had both birth and creation. And when we ascribe
both birth and creation to it, we have made no mistake: for being born, indeed, is one thing,
and being made is another,—the former being the term which is best suited to living beings.
When distinctions, however, have places and times of their own, they occasionally possess
also reciprocity of application among themselves. Thus, the being made admits of being
taken in the sense of being brought forth;1523 inasmuch as everything which receives being
or existence, in any way whatever, is in fact generated. For the maker may really be called
the parent of the thing that is made: in this sense Plato also uses the phraseology. So far,
therefore, as concerns our belief in the souls being made or born, the opinion of the philosopher
is overthrown by the authority of prophecy1524 even.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Probable View of the Stoics, that the Soul Has a Corporeal Nature.</head>
<p>Suppose one summons a Eubulus to his assistance, and a Critolaus, and a Zenocrates,
and on this occasion Plato’s friend Aristotle. They may very possibly hold themselves ready
for stripping the soul of its corporeity, unless they happen to see other philosophers opposed
to them in their purpose—and this, too, in greater numbers—asserting for the soul a corporeal
nature. Now I am not referring merely to those who mould the soul out of manifest bodily
substances, as Hipparchus and Heraclitus (do) out of fire; as Hippon and Thales (do) out
of water; as Empedocles and Critias (do) out of blood; as Epicurus (does) out of atoms, since
even atoms by their coherence form corporeal masses; as Critolaus and his Peripatetics (do)
out of a certain indescribable quintessence,1525 if that may be called a body which rather
includes and embraces bodily substances;—but I call on the Stoics also to help me, who,
while declaring almost in our own terms that the soul is a spiritual essence (inasmuch as
breath and spirit are in their nature very near akin to each other), will yet have no difficulty
in persuading (us) that the soul is a corporeal substance. Indeed, Zeno, defining the soul to
be a spirit generated with (the body,1526) constructs his argument in this way: That substance
which by its departure causes the living being to die is a corporeal one. Now it is by the departure
of the spirit, which is generated with (the body,) that the living being dies; therefore
the spirit which is generated with (the body) is a corporeal substance. But this spirit which
is generated with (the body) is the soul: it follows, then, that the soul is a corporeal substance.
Cleanthes, too, will have it that family likeness passes from parents to their children not
merely in bodily features, but in characteristics of the soul; as if it were out of a mirror of (a
man’s) manners, and faculties, and affections, that bodily likeness and unlikeness are caught
and reflected by the soul also. It is therefore as being corporeal that it is susceptible of likeness
and unlikeness. Again, there is nothing in common between things corporeal and things
incorporeal as to their susceptibility. But the soul certainly sympathizes with the body, and
shares in its pain, whenever it is injured by bruises, and wounds, and sores: the body, too,
suffers with the soul, and is united with it (whenever it is afflicted with anxiety, distress, or
love) in the loss of vigour which its companion sustains, whose shame and fear it testifies
by its own blushes and paleness. The soul, therefore, is (proved to be) corporeal from this
inter-communion of susceptibility. Chrysippus also joins hands in fellowship with Cleanthes
when he lays it down that it is not at all possible for things which are endued with body to
be separated from things which have not body; because they have no such relation as mutual
contact or coherence. Accordingly Lucretius says:1527

<p>(Such severance, however, is quite natural between the soul and the body); for when
the body is deserted by the soul, it is overcome by death. The soul, therefore, is endued with
a body; for if it were not corporeal, it could not desert the body.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—The Arguments of the Platonists for the Soul’s Incorporeality, Opposed,
Perhaps Frivolously.</head>
<p>These conclusions the Platonists disturb more by subtilty than by truth. Every body,
they say, has necessarily either an animate nature1528 or an inanimate one.1529 If it has the
inanimate nature, it receives motion externally to itself; if the animate one, internally. Now
the soul receives motion neither externally nor internally: not externally, since it has not
the inanimate nature; nor internally, because it is itself rather the giver of motion to the
body. It evidently, then, is not a bodily substance, inasmuch as it receives motion neither
way, according to the nature and law of corporeal substances. Now, what first surprises us
here, is the unsuitableness of a definition which appeals to objects which have no affinity
with the soul. For it is impossible for the soul to be called either an animate body or an inanimate
one, inasmuch as it is the soul itself which makes the body either animate, if it be
present to it, or else inanimate, if it be absent from it. That, therefore, which produces a
result, cannot itself be the result, so as to be entitled to the designation of an animate thing
or an inanimate one. The soul is so called in respect of its own substance. If, then, that which
is the soul admits not of being called an animate body or an inanimate one, how can it
challenge comparison with the nature and law of animate and inanimate bodies? Furthermore,
since it is characteristic of a body to be moved externally by something else, and as
we have already shown that the soul receives motion from some other thing when it is
swayed (from the outside, of course, by something else) by prophetic influence or by madness,
therefore I must be right in regarding that as bodily substance which, according to the examples
we have quoted, is moved by some other object from without. Now, if to receive
motion from some other thing is characteristic of a body, how much more is it so to impart
motion to something else! But the soul moves the body, all whose efforts are apparent externally,
and from without. It is the soul which gives motion to the feet for walking, and to
the hands for touching, and to the eyes for sight, and to the tongue for speech—a sort of
internal image which moves and animates the surface. Whence could accrue such power to
the soul, if it were incorporeal? How could an unsubstantial thing propel solid objects? But
in what way do the senses in man seem to be divisible into the corporeal and the intellectual
classes? They tell us that the qualities of things corporeal, such as earth and fire, are indicated
by the bodily senses—of touch and sight; whilst (the qualities) of incorporeal things—for
instance, benevolence and malignity—are discovered by the intellectual faculties. And from
this (they deduce what is to them) the manifest conclusion, that the soul is incorporeal, its
properties being comprehended by the perception not of bodily organs, but of intellectual
faculties. Well, (I shall be much surprised) if I do not at once cut away the very ground on
<note type="footnote">1528 Animale, “having the nature of soul.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1529 Inanimale.</note>

<pb n="389"/>
which their argument stands. For I show them how incorporeal things are commonly submitted
to the bodily senses—sound, for instance, to the organ of hearing; colour, to the organ
of sight; smell, to the olfactory organ. And, just as in these instances, the soul likewise has
its contact with1530 the body; not to say that the incorporeal objects are reported to us
through the bodily organs, for the express reason that they come into contact with the said
organs. Inasmuch, then, as it is evident that even incorporeal objects are embraced and
comprehended by corporeal ones, why should not the soul, which is corporeal, be equally
comprehended and understood by incorporeal faculties? It is thus certain that their argument
fails. Among their more conspicuous arguments will be found this, that in their judgment
every bodily substance is nourished by bodily substances; whereas the soul, as being an incorporeal
essence, is nourished by incorporeal aliments—for instance, by the studies of
wisdom. But even this ground has no stability in it, since Soranus, who is a most accomplished
authority in medical science, affords us as answer, when he asserts that the soul is even
nourished by corporeal aliments; that in fact it is, when failing and weak, actually refreshed
oftentimes by food. Indeed, when deprived of all food, does not the soul entirely remove
from the body? Soranus, then, after discoursing about the soul in the amplest manner, filling
four volumes with his dissertations, and after weighing well all the opinions of the philosophers,
defends the corporeality of the soul, although in the process he has robbed it of its
immortality. For to all men it is not given to believe the truth which Christians are privileged
to hold. As, therefore, Soranus has shown us from facts that the soul is nourished by corporeal
aliments, let the philosopher (adopt a similar mode of proof, and) show that it is sustained
by an incorporeal food. But the fact is, that no one has even been able to quench this
man’s1531 doubts and difficulties about the condition of the soul with the honey-water of
Plato’s subtle eloquence, nor to surfeit them with the crumbs from the minute nostrums of
Aristotle. But what is to become of the souls of all those robust barbarians, which have had
no nurture of philosopher’s lore indeed, and yet are strong in untaught practical wisdom,
and which although very starvelings in philosophy, without your Athenian academies and
porches, and even the prison of Socrates, do yet contrive to live? For it is not the soul’s actual
substance which is benefited by the aliment of learned study, but only its conduct and discipline;
such ailment contributing nothing to increase its bulk, but only to enhance its grace.
It is, moreover, a happy circumstance that the Stoics affirm that even the arts have corporeality;
since at the rate the soul too must be corporeal, since it is commonly supposed to be
nourished by the arts. Such, however, is the enormous preoccupation of the philosophic
mind, that it is generally unable to see straight before it. Hence (the story of) Thales falling
into the well.1532 It very commonly, too, through not understanding even its own opinions,

suspects a failure of its own health. Hence (the story of) Chrysippus and the hellebore. Some
such hallucination, I take it, must have occurred to him, when he asserted that two bodies
could not possibly be contained in one: he must have kept out of mind and sight the case
of those pregnant women who, day after day, bear not one body, but even two and three at
a time, within the embrace of a single womb. One finds likewise, in the records of the civil
law, the instance of a certain Greek woman who gave birth to a quint1533 of children, the
mother of all these at one parturition, the manifold parent of a single brood, the prolific
produce from a single womb, who, guarded by so many bodies—I had almost said, a
people—was herself no less then the sixth person! The whole creation testifies how that
those bodies which are naturally destined to issue from bodies, are already (included) in
that from which they proceed. Now that which proceeds from some other thing must needs
be second to it. Nothing, however, proceeds out of another thing except by the process of
generation; but then they are two (things).</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—The Soul’s Corporeality Demonstrated Out of the Gospels.</head>
<p>So far as the philosophers are concerned, we have said enough. As for our own teachers,
indeed, our reference to them is ex abundanti—a surplusage of authority: in the Gospel itself
they will be found to have the clearest evidence for the corporeal nature of the soul. In hell
the soul of a certain man is in torment, punished in flames, suffering excruciating thirst,
and imploring from the finger of a happier soul, for his tongue, the solace of a drop of water.
1534 Do you suppose that this end of the blessed poor man and the miserable rich man
is only imaginary? Then why the name of Lazarus in this narrative, if the circumstance is
not in (the category of) a real occurrence? But even if it is to be regarded as imaginary, it
will still be a testimony to truth and reality. For unless the soul possessed corporeality, the
image of a soul could not possibly contain a finger of a bodily substance; nor would the
Scripture feign a statement about the limbs of a body, if these had no existence. But what is
that which is removed to Hades1535 after the separation of the body; which is there detained;
which is reserved until the day of judgment; to which Christ also, on dying, descended? I
imagine it is the souls of the patriarchs. But wherefore (all this), if the soul is nothing in its
subterranean abode? For nothing it certainly is, if it is not a bodily substance. For whatever
is incorporeal is incapable of being kept and guarded in any way; it is also exempt from
either punishment or refreshment. That must be a body, by which punishment and refreshment
can be experienced. Of this I shall treat more fully in a more fitting place. Therefore,
whatever amount of punishment or refreshment the soul tastes in Hades, in its prison or
lodging,1536 in the fire or in Abraham’s bosom, it gives proof thereby of its own corporeality.
For an incorporeal thing suffers nothing, not having that which makes it capable of suffering;
else, if it has such capacity, it must be a bodily substance. For in as far as every corporeal
thing is capable of suffering, in so far is that which is capable of suffering also corporeal.1537</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Other Platonist Arguments Considered.</head>
<p>Besides, it would be a harsh and absurd proceeding to exempt anything from the class
of corporeal beings, on the ground that it is not exactly like the other constituents of that
class. And where individual creatures possess various properties, does not this variety in
works of the same class indicate the greatness of the Creator, in making them at the same
time different and yet like, amicable yet rivals? Indeed, the philosophers themselves agree
in saying that the universe consists of harmonious oppositions, according to Empedocles’
(theory of) friendship and enmity. Thus, then, although corporeal essences are opposed to
incorporeal ones, they yet differ from each other in such sort as to amplify their species by
their variety, without changing their genus, remaining all alike corporeal; contributing to
God’s glory in their manifold existence by reason of their variety; so various, by reason of
their differences; so diverse, in that some of them possess one kind of perception, others
another; some feeding on one kind of aliment, others on another; some, again, possessing
visibility, while others are invisible; some being weighty, others light. They are in the habit
of saying that the soul must be pronounced incorporeal on this account, because the bodies
of the dead, after its departure from them, become heavier, whereas they ought to be lighter,
being deprived of the weight of a body—since the soul is a bodily substance. But what, says
Soranus (in answer to this argument), if men should deny that the sea is a bodily substance,
because a ship out of the water becomes a heavy and motionless mass? How much truer
and stronger, then, is the soul’s corporeal essence, which carries about the body, which
eventually assumes so great a weight with the nimblest motion! Again, even if the soul is
invisible, it is only in strict accordance with the condition of its own corporeality, and suitably
to the property of its own essence, as well as to the nature of even those beings to which its
destiny made it to be invisible. The eyes of the owl cannot endure the sun, whilst the eagle
is so well able to face his glory, that the noble character of its young is determined by the
unblinking strength of their gaze; while the eaglet, which turns away its eye from the sun’s
ray, is expelled from the nest as a degenerate creature! So true is it, therefore, than to one
eye an object is invisible, which may be quite plainly seen by another,—without implying
any incorporeality in that which is not endued with an equally strong power (of vision).
The sun is indeed a bodily substance, because it is (composed of) fire; the object, however,
which the eaglet at once admits the existence of, the owl denies, without any prejudice,
nevertheless, to the testimony of the eagle. There is the selfsame difference in respect of the

<pb n="393"/>
soul’s corporeality, which is (perhaps) invisible to the flesh, but perfectly visible to the
spirit. Thus John, being “in the Spirit” of God,1538 beheld plainly the souls of the martyrs.1539</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—Particulars of the Alleged Communication to a Montanist Sister.</head>
<p>When we aver that the soul has a body of a quality and kind peculiar to itself, in this
special condition of it we shall be already supplied with a decision respecting all the other
accidents of its corporeity; how that they belong to it, because we have shown it to be a body,
but that even they have a quality peculiar to themselves, proportioned to the special nature
of the body (to which they belong); or else, if any accidents (of a body) are remarkable in
this instance for their absence, then this, too, results from the peculiarity of the condition
of the soul’s corporeity, from which are absent sundry qualities which are present to all
other corporeal beings. And yet, notwithstanding all this, we shall not be at all inconsistent
if we declare that the more usual characteristics of a body, such as invariably accrue to the
corporeal condition, belong also to the soul—such as form1540 and limitation; and that triad
of dimensions1541—I mean length, and breadth and height—by which philosophers gauge
all bodies. What now remains but for us to give the soul a figure?1542 Plato refuses to do
this, as if it endangered the soul’s immortality.1543 For everything which has figure is, according
to him, compound, and composed of parts;1544 whereas the soul is immortal; and
being immortal, it is therefore indissoluble; and being indissoluble, it is figureless: for if,
on the contrary, it had figure, it would be of a composite and structural formation. He,
however, in some other manner frames for the soul an effigy of intellectual forms, beautiful
for its just symmetry and tuitions of philosophy, but misshapen by some contrary qualities.
As for ourselves, indeed, we inscribe on the soul the lineaments of corporeity, not simply
from the assurance which reasoning has taught us of its corporeal nature, but also from the
firm conviction which divine grace impresses on us by revelation. For, seeing that we acknowledge
spiritual charismata, or gifts, we too have merited the attainment of the prophetic
gift, although coming after John (the Baptist). We have now amongst us a sister whose
lot it has been to be favoured with sundry gifts of revelation, which she experiences in the
Spirit by ecstatic vision amidst the sacred rites of the Lord’s day in the church: she converses
with angels, and sometimes even with the Lord; she both sees and hears mysterious communications;
1545 some men’s hearts she understands, and to them who are in need she distributes
remedies. Whether it be in the reading of Scriptures, or in the chanting of psalms, or
in the preaching of sermons, or in the offering up of prayers, in all these religious services
matter and opportunity are afforded to her of seeing visions. It may possibly have happened

to us, whilst this sister of ours was rapt in the Spirit, that we had discoursed in some ineffable
way about the soul. After the people are dismissed at the conclusion of the sacred services,
she is in the regular habit of reporting to us whatever things she may have seen in vision
(for all her communications are examined with the most scrupulous care, in order that their
truth may be probed). “Amongst other things,” says she, “there has been shown to me a
soul in bodily shape, and a spirit has been in the habit of appearing to me; not, however, a
void and empty illusion, but such as would offer itself to be even grasped by the hand, soft
and transparent and of an etherial colour, and in form resembling that of a human being
in every respect.” This was her vision, and for her witness there was God; and the apostle
most assuredly foretold that there were to be “spiritual gifts” in the church.1546 Now, can
you refuse to believe this, even if indubitable evidence on every point is forthcoming for
your conviction? Since, then, the soul is a corporeal substance, no doubt it possesses qualities
such as those which we have just mentioned, amongst them the property of colour, which
is inherent in every bodily substance. Now what colour would you attribute to the soul but
an etherial transparent one? Not that its substance is actually the ether or air (although this
was the opinion of Ænesidemus and Anaximenes, and I suppose of Heraclitus also, as some
say of him), nor transparent light (although Heraclides of Pontus held it to be so). “Thunderstones,”
1547 indeed, are not of igneous substance, because they shine with ruddy redness;
nor are beryls composed of aqueous matter, because they are of a pure wavy whiteness. How
many things also besides these are there which their colour would associate in the same
class, but which nature keeps widely apart! Since, however, everything which is very attenu-
ated and transparent bears a strong resemblance to the air, such would be the case with the
soul, since in its material nature1548 it is wind and breath, (or spirit); whence it is that the
belief of its corporeal quality is endangered, in consequence of the extreme tenuity and
subtilty of its essence. Likewise, as regards the figure of the human soul from your own
conception, you can well imagine that it is none other than the human form; indeed, none
other than the shape of that body which each individual soul animates and moves about.
This we may at once be induced to admit from contemplating man’s original formation.
For only carefully consider, after God hath breathed upon the face of man the breath of life,
and man had consequently become a living soul, surely that breath must have passed through
the face at once into the interior structure, and have spread itself throughout all the spaces
of the body; and as soon as by the divine inspiration it had become condensed, it must have
impressed itself on each internal feature, which the condensation had filled in, and so have
been, as it were, congealed in shape, (or stereotyped). Hence, by this densifying process,

there arose a fixing of the soul’s corporeity; and by the impression its figure was formed and
moulded. This is the inner man, different from the outer, but yet one in the twofold condition.
1549 It, too, has eyes and ears of its own, by means of which Paul must have heard and
seen the Lord;1550 it has, moreover all the other members of the body by the help of which
it effects all processes of thinking and all activity in dreams. Thus it happens that the rich
man in hell has a tongue and poor (Lazarus) a finger and Abraham a bosom.1551 By these
features also the souls of the martyrs under the altar are distinguished and known. The soul
indeed which in the beginning was associated with Adam’s body, which grew with its growth
and was moulded after its form proved to be the germ both of the entire substance (of the
human soul) and of that (part of) creation.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—The Simple Nature of the Soul is Asserted with Plato. The Identity of
Spirit and Soul.</head>
<p>It is essential to a firm faith to declare with Plato1552 that the soul is simple; in other
words uniform and uncompounded; simply that is to say in respect of its substance. Never
mind men’s artificial views and theories, and away with the fabrications of heresy!1553 Some
maintain that there is within the soul a natural substance—the spirit—which is different
from it:1554 as if to have life—the function of the soul—were one thing; and to emit
breath—the alleged1555 function of the spirit—were another thing. Now it is not in all animals
that these two functions are found; for there are many which only live but do not
breathe in that they do not possess the organs of respiration—lungs and windpipes.1556 But
of what use is it, in an examination of the soul of man, to borrow proofs from a gnat or an
ant, when the great Creator in His divine arrangements has allotted to every animal organs
of vitality suited to its own disposition and nature, so that we ought not to catch at any
conjectures from comparisons of this sort? Man, indeed, although organically furnished
with lungs and windpipes, will not on that account be proved to breathe by one process,
and to live by another;1557 nor can the ant, although defective in these organs, be on that
account said to be without respiration, as if it lived and that was all. For by whom has so
clear an insight into the works of God been really attained, as to entitle him to assume that
these organic resources are wanting to any living thing? There is that Herophilus, the wellknown
surgeon, or (as I may almost call him) butcher, who cut up no end of persons,1558
in order to investigate the secrets of nature, who ruthlessly handled1559 human creatures
to discover (their form and make): I have my doubts whether he succeeded in clearly exploring
all the internal parts of their structure, since death itself changes and disturbs the natural
functions of life, especially when the death is not a natural one, but such as must cause irregularity
and error amidst the very processes of dissection. Philosophers have affirmed it to
be a certain fact, that gnats, and ants, and moths have no pulmonary or arterial organs. Well,
then, tell me, you curious and elaborate investigator of these mysteries, have they eyes for
seeing withal? But yet they proceed to whatever point they wish, and they both shun and

aim at various objects by processes of sight: point out their eyes to me, show me their pupils.
Moths also gnaw and eat: demonstrate to me their mandibles, reveal their jaw-teeth. Then,
again, gnats hum and buzz, nor even in the dark are they unable to find their way to our
ears:1560 point out to me, then, not only the noisy tube, but the stinging lance of that mouth
of theirs. Take any living thing whatever, be it the tiniest you can find, it must needs be fed
and sustained by some food or other: show me, then, their organs for taking into their system,
digesting, and ejecting food. What must we say, therefore? If it is by such instruments that
life is maintained, these instrumental means must of course exist in all things which are to
live, even though they are not apparent to the eye or to the apprehension by reason of their
minuteness. You can more readily believe this, if you remember that God manifests His
creative greatness quite as much in small objects as in the very largest. If, however, you
suppose that God’s wisdom has no capacity for forming such infinitesimal corpuscles, you
can still recognise His greatness, in that He has furnished even to the smallest animals the
functions of life, although in the absence of the suitable organs,—securing to them the power
of sight, even without eyes; of eating, even without teeth; and of digestion, even without
stomachs. Some animals also have the ability to move forward without feet, as serpents, by
a gliding motion; or as worms, by vertical efforts; or as snails and slugs, by their slimy crawl.
Why should you not then believe that respiration likewise may be effected without the bellows
of the lungs, and without arterial canals? You would thus supply yourself with a strong proof
that the spirit or breath is an adjunct of the human soul, for the very reason that some
creatures lack breath, and that they lack it because they are not furnished with organs of
respiration. You think it possible for a thing to live without breath; then why not suppose
that a thing might breathe without lungs? Pray, tell me, what is it to breathe? I suppose it
means to emit breath from yourself. What is it not to live? I suppose it means not to emit
breath from yourself. This is the answer which I should have to make, if “to breathe” is not
the same thing as “to live.” It must, however, be characteristic of a dead man not to respire:
to respire, therefore, is the characteristic of a living man. But to respire is likewise the characteristic
of a breathing man: therefore also to breathe is the characteristic of a living man.
Now, if both one and the other could possibly have been accomplished without the soul, to
breathe might not be a function of the soul, but merely to live. But indeed to live is to breathe,
and to breathe is to live. Therefore this entire process, both of breathing and living, belongs
to that to which living belongs—that is, to the soul. Well, then, since you separate the spirit
(or breath) and the soul, separate their operations also. Let both of them accomplish some
act apart from one another—the soul apart, the spirit apart. Let the soul live without the
spirit; let the spirit breathe without the soul. Let one of them quit men’s bodies, let the other
remain; let death and life meet and agree. If indeed the soul and the spirit are two, they may
<note type="footnote">1560 Aurium cæci.</note>

<pb n="399"/>
be divided; and thus, by the separation of the one which departs from the one which remains,
there would accrue the union and meeting together of life and of death. But such a union
never will accrue: therefore they are not two, and they cannot be divided; but divided they
might have been, if they had been (two). Still two things may surely coalesce in growth. But
the two in question never will coalesce, since to live is one thing, and to breathe is another.
Substances are distinguished by their operations. How much firmer ground have you for
believing that the soul and the spirit are but one, since you assign to them no difference; so
that the soul is itself the spirit, respiration being the function of that of which life also is!
But what if you insist on supposing that the day is one thing, and the light, which is incidental
to the day, is another thing, whereas day is only the light itself? There must, of course,
be also different kinds of light, as (appears) from the ministry of fires. So likewise will there
be different sorts of spirits, according as they emanate from God or from the devil.
Whenever, indeed, the question is about soul and spirit, the soul will be (understood to be)
itself the spirit, just as the day is the light itself. For a thing is itself identical with that by
means of which itself exists.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—Spirit—A Term Expressive of an Operation of the Soul, Not of Its
Nature. To Be Carefully Distinguished from the Spirit of God.</head>
<p>But the nature of my present inquiry obliges me to call the soul spirit or breath, because
to breathe is ascribed to another substance. We, however, claim this (operation) for the soul,
which we acknowledge to be an indivisible simple substance, and therefore we must call it
spirit in a definitive sense—not because of its condition, but of its action; not in respect of
its nature, but of its operation; because it respires, and not because it is spirit in any especial
sense.1561 For to blow or breathe is to respire. So that we are driven to describe, by (the term
which indicates this respiration—that is to say) spirit—the soul which we hold to be, by the
propriety of its action, breath. Moreover, we properly and especially insist on calling it breath
(or spirit), in opposition to Hermogenes, who derives the soul from matter instead of from
the afflatus or breath of God. He, to be sure, goes flatly against the testimony of Scripture,
and with this view converts breath into spirit, because he cannot believe that the (creature
on which was breathed the) Spirit of God fell into sin, and then into condemnation; and
therefore he would conclude that the soul came from matter rather than from the Spirit or
breath of God. For this reason, we on our side even from that passage, maintain the soul to
be breath and not the spirit, in the scriptural and distinctive sense of the spirit; and here it
is with regret that we apply the term spirit at all in the lower sense, in consequence of the
identical action of respiring and breathing. In that passage, the only question is about the
natural substance; to respire being an act of nature. I would not tarry a moment longer on
this point, were it not for those heretics who introduce into the soul some spiritual germ
which passes my comprehension: (they make it to have been) conferred upon the soul by
the secret liberality of her mother Sophia (Wisdom), without the knowledge of the Creator.
1562 But (Holy) Scripture, which has a better knowledge of the soul’s Maker, or rather
God, has told us nothing more than that God breathed on man’s face the breath of life, and
that man became a living soul, by means of which he was both to live and breathe; at the
same time making a sufficiently clear distinction between the spirit and the soul,1563 in such
passages as the following, wherein God Himself declares: “My Spirit went forth from me,
and I made the breath of each. And the breath of my Spirit became soul.”1564 And again:
“He giveth breath unto the people that are on the earth, and Spirit to them that walk thereon.”
1565 First of all there comes the (natural) soul, that is to say, the breath, to the people
that are on the earth,—in other words, to those who act carnally in the flesh; then afterwards

<note type="footnote">1565 Isa. xlii. 5.</note>

<pb n="401"/>
comes the Spirit to those who walk thereon,—that is, who subdue the works of the flesh;
because the apostle also says, that “that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural,
(or in possession of the natural soul,) and afterward that which is spiritual.”1566 For,
inasmuch as Adam straightway predicted that “great mystery of Christ and the church,”1567
when he said, “This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; therefore shall a man
leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they two shall become
one flesh,”1568 he experienced the influence of the Spirit. For there fell upon him that ecstasy,
which is the Holy Ghost’s operative virtue of prophecy. And even the evil spirit too is an
influence which comes upon a man. Indeed, the Spirit of God not more really “turned Saul
into another man,”1569 that is to say, into a prophet, when “people said one to another,
What is this which is come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?”1570 than
did the evil spirit afterwards turn him into another man—in other words, into an apostate.
Judas likewise was for a long time reckoned among the elect (apostles), and was even appointed
to the office of their treasurer; he was not yet the traitor, although he was become
fraudulent; but afterwards the devil entered into him. Consequently, as the spirit neither of
God nor of the devil is naturally planted with a man’s soul at his birth, this soul must evidently
exist apart and alone, previous to the accession to it of either spirit: if thus apart and alone,
it must also be simple and uncompounded as regards its substance; and therefore it cannot
respire from any other cause than from the actual condition of its own substance.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Difference Between the Mind and the Soul, and the Relation Between
Them.</head>
<p>In like manner the mind also, or animus, which the Greeks designate ΝΟΥΣ, is taken by
us in no other sense than as indicating that faculty or apparatus1571 which is inherent and
implanted in the soul, and naturally proper to it, whereby it acts, whereby it acquires
knowledge, and by the possession of which it is capable of a spontaneity of motion within
itself, and of thus appearing to be impelled by the mind, as if it were another substance, as
is maintained by those who determine the soul to be the moving principle of the uni-
verse1572—the god of Socrates, Valentinus’ “only-begotten” of his father1573 Bythus, and
his mother Sige. How confused is the opinion of Anaxagoras! For, having imagined the
mind to be the initiating principle of all things, and suspending on its axis the balance of
the universe; affirming, moreover, that the mind is a simple principle, unmixed, and incapable
of admixture, he mainly on this very consideration separates it from all amalgamation with
the soul; and yet in another passage he actually incorporates it with1574 the soul. This (inconsistency)
Aristotle has also observed: but whether he meant his criticism to be constructive,
and to fill up a system of his own, rather than destructive of the principles of others, I
am hardly able to decide. As for himself, indeed, although he postpones his definition of
the mind, yet he begins by mentioning, as one of the two natural constituents of the mind,1575
that divine principle which he conjectures to be impassible, or incapable of emotion, and
thereby removes from all association with the soul. For whereas it is evident that the soul
is susceptible of those emotions which it falls to it naturally to suffer, it must needs suffer
either by the mind or with the mind. Now if the soul is by nature associated with the mind,
it is impossible to draw the conclusion that the mind is impassible; or again, if the soul suffers
not either by the mind or with the mind, it cannot possibly have a natural association with
the mind, with which it suffers nothing, and which suffers nothing itself. Moreover, if the
soul suffers nothing by the mind and with the mind, it will experience no sensation, nor
will it acquire any knowledge, nor will it undergo any emotion through the agency of the
mind, as they maintain it will. For Aristotle makes even the senses passions, or states of
emotion. And rightly too. For to exercise the senses is to suffer emotion, because to suffer
is to feel. In like manner, to acquire knowledge is to exercise the senses; and to undergo
emotion is to exercise the senses; and the whole of this is a state of suffering. But we see
that the soul experiences nothing of these things, in such a manner as that the mind also is

<note type="footnote">1575 Alterum animi genus.</note>

<pb n="403"/>
affected by the emotion, by which, indeed, and with which, all is effected. It follows, therefore,
that the mind is capable of admixture, in opposition to Anaxagoras; and passible or susceptible
of emotion, contrary to the opinion of Aristotle. Besides, if a separate condition between
the soul and mind is to be admitted, so that they be two things in substance, then of one of
them, emotion and sensation, and every sort of taste, and all action and motion, will be the
characteristics; whilst of the other the natural condition will be calm, and repose, and stupor.
There is therefore no alternative: either the mind must be useless and void, or the soul. But
if these affections may certainly be all of them ascribed to both, then in that case the two
will be one and the same, and Democritus will carry his point when he suppresses all distinction
between the two. The question will arise how two can be one—whether by the confusion
of two substances, or by the disposition of one? We, however, affirm that the mind coalesces
with1576 the soul,—not indeed as being distinct from it in substance, but as being its natural
function and agent.1577</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—The Soul’s Supremacy.</head>
<p>It next remains to examine where lies the supremacy; in other words, which of the two
is superior to the other, so that with which the supremacy clearly lies shall be the essentially
superior substance;1578 whilst that over which this essentially superior substance shall have
authority shall be considered as the natural functionary of the superior substance. Now who
will hesitate to ascribe this entire authority to the soul, from the name of which the whole
man has received his own designation in common phraseology? How many souls, says the
rich man, do I maintain? not how many minds. The pilot’s desire, also, is to rescue so many
souls from shipwreck, not so many minds; the labourer, too, in his work, and the soldier on
the field of battle, affirms that he lays down his soul (or life), not his mind. Which of the
two has its perils or its vows and wishes more frequently on men’s lips—the mind or the
soul? Which of the two are dying persons, said to have to do with the mind or the soul? In
short, philosophers themselves, and medical men, even when it is their purpose to discourse
about the mind, do in every instance inscribe on their title-page1579 and table of contents,1580
“De Anima” (“A treatise on the soul”). And that you may also have God’s voucher on the
subject, it is the soul which He addresses; it is the soul which He exhorts and counsels, to
turn the mind and intellect to Him. It is the soul which Christ came to save; it is the soul
which He threatens to destroy in hell; it is the soul (or life) which He forbids being made
too much of; it is His soul, too (or life), which the good Shepherd Himself lays down for
His sheep. It is to the soul, therefore, that you ascribe the supremacy; in it also you possess
that union of substance, of which you perceive the mind to be the instrument, not the ruling
power.</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—The Soul Variously Divided by the Philosophers; This Division is
Not a Material Dissection.</head>
<p>Being thus single, simple, and entire in itself, it is as incapable of being composed and
put together from external constituents, as it is of being divided in and of itself, inasmuch
as it is indissoluble. For if it had been possible to construct it and to destroy it, it would no
longer be immortal. Since, however, it is not mortal, it is also incapable of dissolution and
division. Now, to be divided means to be dissolved, and to be dissolved means to die. Yet
(philosophers) have divided the soul into parts: Plato, for instance, into two; Zeno into three;
Panætius, into five or six; Soranus, into seven; Chrysippus, into as many as eight; and
Apollophanes, into as many as nine; whilst certain of the Stoics have found as many as twelve
parts in the soul. Posidonius makes even two more than these: he starts with two leading
faculties of the soul,—the directing faculty, which they designate ἡγεμονικόν; and the rational
faculty, which they call λογικόν,—and ultimately subdivided these into seventeen1581 parts.
Thus variously is the soul dissected by the different schools. Such divisions, however, ought
not to be regarded so much as parts of the soul, as powers, or faculties, or operations
thereof, even as Aristotle himself has regarded some of them as being. For they are not
portions or organic parts of the soul’s substance, but functions of the soul—such as those
of motion, of action, of thought, and whatsoever others they divide in this manner; such,
likewise, as the five senses themselves, so well known to all—seeing, hearing, tasting,
touching, smelling. Now, although they have allotted to the whole of these respectively
certain parts of the body as their special domiciles, it does not from that circumstance follow
that a like distribution will be suitable to the sections of the soul; for even the body itself
would not admit of such a partition as they would have the soul undergo. But of the whole
number of the limbs one body is made up, so that the arrangement is rather a concretion
than a division. Look at that very wonderful piece of organic mechanism by Archimedes,—I
mean his hydraulic organ, with its many limbs, parts, bands, passages for the notes, outlets
for their sounds, combinations for their harmony, and the array of its pipes; but yet the
whole of these details constitute only one instrument. In like manner the wind, which
breathes throughout this organ at the impulse of the hydraulic engine, is not divided into
separate portions from the fact of its dispersion through the instrument to make it play: it
is whole and entire in its substance, although divided in its operation. This example is not
remote from (the illustration) of Strato, and Ænesidemus, and Heraclitus: for these philosophers
maintain the unity of the soul, as diffused over the entire body, and yet in every
part the same.1582 Precisely like the wind blown in the pipes throughout the organ, the soul
displays its energies in various ways by means of the senses, being not indeed divided, but
<note type="footnote">1581 This is Oehler’s text; another reading has twelve, which one would suppose to be the right one.</note>
<note type="footnote">1582 Ubique ipsa.</note>

<pb n="406"/>
rather distributed in natural order. Now, under what designations these energies are to be
known, and by what divisions of themselves they are to be classified, and to what special
offices and functions in the body they are to be severally confined, the physicians and the
philosophers must consider and decide: for ourselves, a few remarks only will be proper.</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—The Soul’s Vitality and Intelligence. Its Character and Seat in Man.</head>
<p>In the first place, (we must determine) whether there be in the soul some supreme
principle of vitality and intelligence1583 which they call “the ruling power of the soul”—τὸ
ἡγεμονικόν for if this be not admitted, the whole condition of the soul is put in jeopardy.
Indeed, those men who say that there is no such directing faculty, have begun by supposing
that the soul itself is simply a nonentity. One Dicæarchus, a Messenian, and amongst the
medical profession Andreas and Asclepiades, have thus destroyed the (soul’s) directing
power, by actually placing in the mind the senses, for which they claim the ruling faculty.
Asclepiades rides rough-shod over us with even this argument, that very many animals,
after losing those parts of their body in which the soul’s principle of vitality and sensation
is thought mainly to exist, still retain life in a considerable degree, as well as sensation: as
in the case of flies, and wasps, and locusts, when you have cut off their heads; and of shegoats,
and tortoises, and eels, when you have pulled out their hearts. (He concludes),
therefore, that there is no especial principle or power of the soul; for if there were, the soul’s
vigour and strength could not continue when it was removed with its domiciles (or corporeal
organs). However, Dicæarchus has several authorities against him—and philosophers
too—Plato, Strato, Epicurus, Democritus, Empedocles, Socrates, Aristotle; whilst in opposition
to Andreas and Asclepiades (may be placed their brother) physicians Herophilus,
Erasistratus, Diocles, Hippocrates, and Soranus himself; and better than all others, there are
our Christian authorities. We are taught by God concerning both these questions—viz. that
there is a ruling power in the soul, and that it is enshrined1584 in one particular recess of
the body. For, when one reads of God as being “the searcher and witness of the heart;”1585
when His prophet is reproved by His discovering to him the secrets of the heart;1586 when
God Himself anticipates in His people the thoughts of their heart,1587 “Why think ye evil
in your hearts?”1588 when David prays “Create in me a clean heart, O God,”1589 and Paul
declares, “With the heart man believeth unto righteousness,”1590 and John says, “By his
own heart is each man condemned;”1591 when, lastly, “he who looketh on a woman so as

to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart,”1592—then both
points are cleared fully up, that there is a directing faculty of the soul, with which the purpose
of God may agree; in other words, a supreme principle of intelligence and vitality (for where
there is intelligence, there must be vitality), and that it resides in that most precious part1593
of our body to which God especially looks: so that you must not suppose, with Heraclitus,
that this sovereign faculty of which we are treating is moved by some external force; nor
with Moschion,1594 that it floats about through the whole body; nor with Plato, that it is
enclosed in the head; nor with Zenophanes, that it culminates in the crown of the head; nor
that it reposes in the brain, according to the opinion of Hippocrates; nor around the basis
of the brain, as Herophilus thought; nor in the membranes thereof, as Strato and Erasistratus
said; nor in the space between the eyebrows, as Strato the physician held; nor within the
enclosure1595 of the breast, according to Epicurus: but rather, as the Egyptians have always

view, so that (our friend) Asclepiades may go in quest of his goats bleating without a heart,
and hunt his flies without their heads; and let all those (worthies), too, who have predetermined
the character of the human soul from the condition of brute animals, be quite sure
that it is themselves rather who are alive in a heartless and brainless state.</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—The Soul’s Parts. Elements of the Rational Soul.</head>
<p>That position of Plato’s is also quite in keeping with the faith, in which he divides the
soul into two parts—the rational and the irrational. To this definition we take no exception,
except that we would not ascribe this twofold distinction to the nature (of the soul). It is the
rational element which we must believe to be its natural condition, impressed upon it from
its very first creation by its Author, who is Himself essentially rational. For how should that
be other than rational, which God produced on His own prompting; nay more, which He
expressly sent forth by His own afflatus or breath? The irrational element, however, we must
understand to have accrued later, as having proceeded from the instigation of the serpent—
the very achievement of (the first) transgression—which thenceforward became inherent
in the soul, and grew with its growth, assuming the manner by this time of a natural
development, happening as it did immediately at the beginning of nature. But, inasmuch
as the same Plato speaks of the rational element only as existing in the soul of God Himself,
if we were to ascribe the irrational element likewise to the nature which our soul has received
from God, then the irrational element will be equally derived from God, as being a natural
production, because God is the author of nature. Now from the devil proceeds the incentive
to sin. All sin, however, is irrational: therefore the irrational proceeds from the devil, from
whom sin proceeds; and it is extraneous to God, to whom also the irrational is an alien
principle. The diversity, then, between these two elements arises from the difference of
their authors. When, therefore, Plato reserves the rational element (of the soul) to God
alone, and subdivides it into two departments: the irascible, which they call θυμικόν, and
the concupiscible, which they designate by the term ἐπιθυμητικόν (in such a way as to make
the first common to us and lions, and the second shared between ourselves and flies, whilst
the rational element is confined to us and God)—I see that this point will have to be treated
by us, owing to the facts which we find operating also in Christ. For you may behold this
triad of qualities in the Lord. There was the rational element, by which He taught, by which
He discoursed, by which He prepared the way of salvation; there was moreover indignation
in Him, by which He inveighed against the scribes and the Pharisees; and there was the
principle of desire, by which He so earnestly desired to eat the passover with His disciples.1599
In our own cases, accordingly, the irascible and the concupiscible elements of our soul must
not invariably be put to the account of the irrational (nature), since we are sure that in our
Lord these elements operated in entire accordance with reason. God will be angry, with
perfect reason, with all who deserve His wrath; and with reason, too, will God desire whatever
objects and claims are worthy of Himself. For He will show indignation against the evil
man, and for the good man will He desire salvation. To ourselves even does the apostle allow
the concupiscible quality. “If any man,” says he, “desireth the office of a bishop, he desireth
<note type="footnote">1599 Luke xxii. 15.</note>

<pb n="410"/>
a good work.”1600 Now, by saying “a good work,” he shows us that the desire is a reasonable
one. He permits us likewise to feel indignation. How should he not, when he himself experiences
the same? “I would,” says he, “that they were even cut off which trouble you.”1601 In
perfect agreement with reason was that indignation which resulted from his desire to
maintain discipline and order. When, however, he says, “We were formerly the children of
wrath,”1602 he censures an irrational irascibility, such as proceeds not from that nature
which is the production of God, but from that which the devil brought in, who is himself
styled the lord or “master” of his own class, “Ye cannot serve two masters,”1603 and has the
actual designation of “father:” “Ye are of your father the devil.”1604 So that you need not
be afraid to ascribe to him the mastery and dominion over that second, later, and deteriorated
nature (of which we have been speaking), when you read of him as “the sewer of tares,” and
the nocturnal spoiler of the crop of corn.1605</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.—The Fidelity of the Senses, Impugned by Plato, Vindicated by Christ
Himself.</head>
<p>Then, again, when we encounter the question (as to the veracity of those five senses
which we learn with our alphabet; since from this source even there arises some support for
our heretics. They are the faculties of seeing, and hearing, and smelling, and tasting, and
touching. The fidelity of these senses is impugned with too much severity by the Platonists,
1606 and according to some by Heraclitus also, and Diocles, and Empedocles; at any
rate, Plato, in the Timæus, declares the operations of the senses to be irrational, and vitiated1607
by our opinions or beliefs. Deception is imputed to the sight, because it asserts that
oars, when immersed in the water, are inclined or bent, notwithstanding the certainty that
they are straight; because, again, it is quite sure that that distant tower with its really quadrangular
contour is round; because also it will discredit the fact of the truly parallel fabric
of yonder porch or arcade, by supposing it to be narrower and narrower towards its end;
and because it will join with the sea the sky which hangs at so great a height above it. In the
same way, our hearing is charged with fallacy: we think, for instance, that that is a noise in
the sky which is nothing else than the rumbling of a carriage; or, if you prefer it1608 the
other way, when the thunder rolled at a distance, we were quite sure that it was a carriage
which made the noise. Thus, too, are our faculties of smell and taste at fault, because the
selfsame perfumes and wines lose their value after we have used them awhile. On the same
principle our touch is censured, when the identical pavement which seemed rough to the
hands is felt by the feet to be smooth enough; and in the baths a stream of warm water is
pronounced to be quite hot at first, and beautifully temperate afterwards. Thus, according
to them, our senses deceive us, when all the while we are (the cause of the discrepancies, by)
changing our opinions. The Stoics are more moderate in their views; for they do not load
with the obloquy of deception every one of the senses, and at all times. The Epicureans,
again, show still greater consistency, in maintaining that all the senses are equally true in
their testimony, and always so—only in a different way. It is not our organs of sensation
that are at fault, but our opinion. The senses only experience sensation, they do not exercise
opinion; it is the soul that opines. They separated opinion from the senses, and sensation
from the soul. Well, but whence comes opinion, if not from the senses? Indeed, unless the
eye had descried a round shape in that tower, it could have had no idea that it possessed
roundness. Again, whence arises sensation if not from the soul? For if the soul had no body,
it would have no sensation. Accordingly, sensation comes from the soul, and opinion from
sensation; and the whole (process) is the soul. But further, it may well be insisted on that
<note type="footnote">1606 Academici.</note>

<note type="footnote">1608 Vel.</note>

<pb n="412"/>
there is a something which causes the discrepancy between the report of the senses and the
reality of the facts. Now, since it is possible, (as we have seen), for phenomena to be reported
which exist not in the objects, why should it not be equally possible for phenomena to be
reported which are caused not by the senses, but by reasons and conditions which intervene,
in the very nature of the case? If so, it will be only right that they should be duly recognised.
The truth is, that it was the water which was the cause of the oar seeming to be inclined or
bent: out of the water, it was perfectly straight in appearance (as well as in fact). The delicacy
of the substance or medium which forms a mirror by means of its luminosity, according as
it is struck or shaken, by the vibration actually destroys the appearance of the straightness
of a right line. In like manner, the condition of the open space which fills up the interval
between it and us, necessarily causes the true shape of the tower to escape our notice; for
the uniform density of the surrounding air covering its angles with a similar light obliterates
their outlines. So, again, the equal breadth of the arcade is sharpened or narrowed off towards
its termination, until its aspect, becoming more and more contracted under its prolonged
roof, comes to a vanishing point in the direction of its farthest distance. So the sky blends
itself with the sea, the vision becoming spent at last, which had maintained duly the
boundaries of the two elements, so long as its vigorous glance lasted. As for the (alleged
cases of deceptive) hearing, what else could produce the illusion but the similarity of the
sounds? And if the perfume afterwards was less strong to the smell, and the wine more flat
to the taste, and the water not so hot to the touch, their original strength was after all found
in the whole of them pretty well unimpaired. In the matter, however, of the roughness and
smoothness of the pavement, it was only natural and right that limbs like the hands and the
feet, so different in tenderness and callousness, should have different impressions. In this
way, then, there cannot occur an illusion in our senses without an adequate cause. Now if
special causes, (such as we have indicated,) mislead our senses and (through our senses)
our opinions also, then we must no longer ascribe the deception to the senses, which follow
the specific causes of the illusion, nor to the opinions we form; for these are occasioned and
controlled by our senses, which only follow the causes. Persons who are afflicted with
madness or insanity, mistake one object for another. Orestes in his sister sees his mother;
Ajax sees Ulysses in the slaughtered herd; Athamas and Agave descry wild beasts in their
children. Now is it their eyes or their phrenzy which you must blame for so vast a fallacy?
All things taste bitter, in the redundancy of their bile, to those who have the jaundice. Is it
their taste which you will charge with the physical prevarication, or their ill state of health?
All the senses, therefore, are disordered occasionally, or imposed upon, but only in such a
way as to be quite free of any fault in their own natural functions. But further still, not even
against the specific causes and conditions themselves must we lay an indictment of deception.
For, since these physical aberrations happen for stated reasons, the reasons do not deserve
to be regarded as deceptions. Whatever ought to occur in a certain manner is not a deception.

<pb n="413"/>
If, then, even these circumstantial causes must be acquitted of all censure and blame, how
much more should we free from reproach the senses, over which the said causes exercise a
liberal sway! Hence we are bound most certainly to claim for the senses truth, and fidelity,
and integrity, seeing that they never render any other account of their impressions than is
enjoined on them by the specific causes or conditions which in all cases produce that discrepancy
which appears between the report of the senses and the reality of the objects. What
mean you, then, O most insolent Academy? You overthrow the entire condition of human
life; you disturb the whole order of nature; you obscure the good providence of God Himself:
for the senses of man which God has appointed over all His works, that we might understand,
inhabit, dispense, and enjoy them, (you reproach) as fallacious and treacherous tyrants! But
is it not from these that all creation receives our services? Is it not by their means that a
second form is impressed even upon the world?—so many arts, so many industrious resources,
so many pursuits, such business, such offices, such commerce, such remedies,
counsels, consolations, modes, civilizations, and accomplishments of life! All these things
have produced the very relish and savour of human existence; whilst by these senses of man,
he alone of all animated nature has the distinction of being a rational animal, with a capacity
for intelligence and knowledge—nay, an ability to form the Academy itself! But Plato, in
order to disparage the testimony of the senses, in the Phædrus denies (in the person of Socrates)
his own ability to know even himself, according to the injunction of the Delphic oracle;
and in the Theætetus he deprives himself of the faculties of knowledge and sensation; and
again, in the Phædrus he postpones till after death the posthumous knowledge, as he calls
it, of the truth; and yet for all he went on playing the philosopher even before he died. We
may not, I say, we may not call into question the truth of the (poor vilified) senses,1609 lest
we should even in Christ Himself, bring doubt upon1610 the truth of their sensation; lest
perchance it should be said that He did not really “behold Satan as lightning fall from
heaven;”1611 that He did not really hear the Father’s voice testifying of Himself;1612 or that
He was deceived in touching Peter’s wife’s mother;1613 or that the fragrance of the ointment
which He afterwards smelled was different from that which He accepted for His burial;1614
and that the taste of the wine was different from that which He consecrated in memory of
His blood.1615 On this false principle it was that Marcion actually chose to believe that He

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Plato Suggested Certain Errors to the Gnostics. Functions of the
Soul.</head>
<p>I turn now to the department of our intellectual faculties, such as Plato has handed it
over to the heretics, distinct from our bodily functions, having obtained the knowledge of
them before death.1620 He asks in the Phædo, What, then, (do you think) concerning the
actual possession of knowledge? Will the body be a hindrance to it or not, if one shall admit
it as an associate in the search after knowledge? I have a similar question to ask: Have the
faculties of their sight and hearing any truth and reality for human beings or not? Is it not
the case, that even the poets are always muttering against us, that we can never hear or see
anything for certain? He remembered, no doubt, what Epicharmus the comic poet had said:
“It is the mind which sees, the mind that hears—all else is blind and deaf.” To the same
purport he says again, that man is the wisest whose mental power is the clearest; who never
applies the sense of sight, nor adds to his mind the help of any such faculty, but employs
the intellect itself in unmixed serenity when he indulges in contemplation for the purpose
of acquiring an unalloyed insight into the nature of things; divorcing himself with all his
might from his eyes and ears and (as one must express himself) from the whole of his body,
on the ground of its disturbing the soul, and not allowing it to possess either truth or wisdom,
whenever it is brought into communication with it. We see, then, that in opposition to the
bodily senses another faculty is provided of a much more serviceable character, even the
powers of the soul, which produce an understanding of that truth whose realities are not
palpable nor open to the bodily senses, but are very remote from men’s everyday knowledge,
lying in secret—in the heights above, and in the presence of God Himself. For Plato maintains
that there are certain invisible substances, incorporeal, celestial,1621 divine, and eternal,
which they call ideas, that is to say, (archetypal) forms, which are the patterns and causes
of those objects of nature which are manifest to us, and lie under our corporeal senses: the
former, (according to Plato,) are the actual verities, and the latter the images and likenesses
of them. Well, now, are there not here gleams of the heretical principles of the Gnostics and
the Valentinians? It is from this philosophy that they eagerly adopt the difference between
the bodily senses and the intellectual faculties,—a distinction which they actually apply to
the parable of the ten virgins: making the five foolish virgins to symbolize the five bodily
senses, seeing that these are so silly and so easy to be deceived; and the wise virgin to express
the meaning of the intellectual faculties, which are so wise as to attain to that mysterious
and supernal truth, which is placed in the pleroma. (Here, then, we have) the mystic original
of the ideas of these heretics. For in this philosophy lie both their Æons and their genealogies.
Thus, too, do they divide sensation, both into the intellectual powers from their spiritual
<note type="footnote">1620 Said ironically, as if rallying Plato for inconsistency between his theory here and the fact.</note>
<note type="footnote">1621 Supermundiales “placed above this world.”</note>

<pb n="416"/>
seed, and the sensuous faculties from the animal, which cannot by any means comprehend
spiritual things. From the former germ spring invisible things; from the latter, visible things
which are grovelling and temporary, and which are obvious to the senses, placed as they are
in palpable forms.1622 It is because of these views that we have in a former passage stated
as a preliminary fact, that the mind is nothing else than an apparatus or instrument of the
soul,1623 and that the spirit is no other faculty, separate from the soul, but is the soul itself
exercised in respiration; although that influence which either God on the one hand, or the
devil on the other, has breathed upon it, must be regarded in the light of an additional element.
1624 And now, with respect to the difference between the intellectual powers and the
sensuous faculties, we only admit it so far as the natural diversity between them requires of
us. (There is, of course, a difference) between things corporeal and things spiritual, between
visible and invisible beings, between objects which are manifest to the view and those which
are hidden from it; because the one class are attributed to sensation, and the other to the
intellect. But yet both the one and the other must be regarded as inherent in the soul, and
as obedient to it, seeing that it embraces bodily objects by means of the body, in exactly the
same way that it conceives incorporeal objects by help of the mind, except that it is even
exercising sensation when it is employing the intellect. For is it not true, that to employ the
senses is to use the intellect? And to employ the intellect amounts to a use of the senses?1625
What indeed can sensation be, but the understanding of that which is the object of the sensation?
And what can the intellect or understanding be, but the seeing of that which is the
object understood? Why adopt such excruciating means of torturing simple knowledge and
crucifying the truth? Who can show me the sense which does not understand the object of
its sensation, or the intellect which perceives not the object which it understands, in so clear
a way as to prove to me that the one can do without the other? If corporeal things are the
objects of sense, and incorporeal ones objects of the intellect, it is the classes of the objects
which are different, not the domicile or abode of sense and intellect; in other words, not the
soul (anima) and the mind (animus). By what, in short, are corporeal things perceived? If
it is by the soul,1626 then the mind is a sensuous faculty, and not merely an intellectual
power; for whilst it understands, it also perceives, because without the perception there is
no understanding. If, however, corporeal things are perceived by the soul, then it follows
that the soul’s power is an intellectual one, and not merely a sensuous faculty; for while it
perceives it also understands, because without understanding there is no perceiving. And

Plato Suggested Certain Errors to the Gnostics. Functions of the Soul.
then, again, by what are incorporeal things understood? If it is by the mind,1627 where will
be the soul? If it is by the soul, where will be the mind? For things which differ ought to be
mutually absent from each other, when they are occupied in their respective functions and
duties. It must be your opinion, indeed, that the mind is absent from the soul on certain
occasions; for (you suppose) that we are so made and constituted as not to know that we
have seen or heard something, on the hypothesis1628 that the mind was absent at the time.
I must therefore maintain that the very soul itself neither saw nor heard, since it was at the
given moment absent with its active power—that is to say, the mind. The truth is, that
whenever a man is out of his mind,1629 it is his soul that is demented—not because the mind
is absent, but because it is a fellow-sufferer (with the soul) at the time.1630 Indeed, it is the
soul which is principally affected by casualties of such a kind. Whence is this fact confirmed?
It is confirmed from the following consideration: that after the soul’s departure, the mind
is no longer found in a man: it always follows the soul; nor does it at last remain behind it
alone, after death. Now, since it follows the soul, it is also indissolubly attached to it; just as
the understanding is attached to the soul, which is followed by the mind, with which the
understanding is indissolubly connected. Granted now that the understanding is superior
to the senses, and a better discoverer of mysteries, what matters it, so long as it is only a
peculiar faculty of the soul, just as the senses themselves are? It does not at all affect my argument,
unless the understanding were held to be superior to the senses, for the purpose
of deducing from the allegation of such superiority its separate condition likewise. After
thus combating their alleged difference, I have also to refute this question of superiority,
previous to my approaching the belief (which heresy propounds) in a superior god. On this
point, however, of a (superior) god, we shall have to measure swords with the heretics on
their own ground.1631 Our present subject concerns the soul, and the point is to prevent
the insidious ascription of a superiority to the intellect or understanding. Now, although
the objects which are touched by the intellect are of a higher nature, since they are spiritual,
than those which are embraced by the senses, since these are corporeal, it will still be only
a superiority in the objects—as of lofty ones contrasted with humble—not in the faculties
of the intellect against the senses. For how can the intellect be superior to the senses, when
it is these which educate it for the discovery of various truths? It is a fact, that these truths

are learned by means of palpable forms; in other words, invisible things are discovered by
the help of visible ones, even as the apostle tells us in his epistle: “For the invisible things of
Him are clearly seen from the creation of the world, being understood by the things that
are made;”1632 and as Plato too might inform our heretics: “The things which appear are
the image1633 of the things which are concealed from view,”1634 whence it must needs follow
that this world is by all means an image of some other: so that the intellect evidently uses
the senses for its own guidance, and authority, and mainstay; and without the senses truth
could not be attained. How, then, can a thing be superior to that which is instrumental to
its existence, which is also indispensable to it, and to whose help it owes everything which
it acquires? Two conclusions therefore follow from what we have said: (1) That the intellect
is not to be preferred above the senses, on the (supposed) ground that the agent through
which a thing exists is inferior to the thing itself; and (2) that the intellect must not be separated
from the senses, since the instrument by which a thing’s existence is sustained is associated
with the thing itself.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—The Intellect Coeval with the Soul in the Human Being. An Example
from Aristotle Converted into Evidence Favourable to These Views.</head>
<p>Nor must we fail to notice those writers who deprive the soul of the intellect even for a
short period of time. They do this in order to prepare the way of introducing the intellect—and
the mind also—at a subsequent time of life, even at the time when intelligence appears in a
man. They maintain that the stage of infancy is supported by the soul alone, simply to promote
vitality, without any intention of acquiring knowledge also, because not all things have
knowledge which possess life. Trees, for instance, to quote Aristotle’s example,1635 have
vitality, but have not knowledge; and with him agrees every one who gives a share to all animated
beings of the animal substance, which, according to our view, exists in man alone
as his special property,—not because it is the work of God, which all other creatures are
likewise, but because it is the breath of God, which this (human soul) alone is, which we say
is born with the full equipment of its proper faculties. Well, let them meet us with the example
of the trees: we will accept their challenge, (nor shall we find in it any detriment to our own
argument;) for it is an undoubted fact, that whilst trees are yet but twigs and sprouts, and
before they even reach the sapling stage, there is in them their own proper faculty of life, as
soon as they spring out of their native beds. But then, as time goes on, the vigour of the tree
slowly advances, as it grows and hardens into its woody trunk, until its mature age completes
the condition which nature destines for it. Else what resources would trees possess in due
course for the inoculation of grafts, and the formation of leaves, and the swelling of their
buds, and the graceful shedding of their blossom, and the softening of their sap, were there
not in them the quiet growth of the full provision of their nature, and the distribution of
this life over all their branches for the accomplishment of their maturity? Trees, therefore,
have ability or knowledge; and they derive it from whence they also derive vitality—that is,
from the one source of vitality and knowledge which is peculiar to their nature, and that
from the infancy which they, too, begin with. For I observe that even the vine, although yet
tender and immature, still understands its own natural business, and strives to cling to some
support, that, leaning on it, and lacing through it,1636 it may so attain its growth. Indeed,
without waiting for the husbandman’s training, without an espalier, without a prop, whatever
its tendrils catch, it will fondly cling to,1637 and embrace with really greater tenacity and
force by its own inclination than by your volition. It longs and hastens to be secure. Take
also ivy-plants, never mind how young: I observe their attempts from the very first to grasp
objects above them, and outrunning everything else, to hang on to the highest thing, preferring
as they do to spread over walls with their leafy web and woof rather than creep on the

ground and be trodden under by every foot that likes to crush them. On the other hand, in
the case of such trees as receive injury from contact with a building, how do they hang off
as they grow and avoid what injures them! You can see that their branches were naturally
meant to take the opposite direction, and can very well understand the vital instincts1638 of
such a tree from its avoidance of the wall. It is contented (if it be only a little shrub) with
its own insignificant destiny, which it has in its foreseeing instinct thoroughly been aware
of from its infancy, only it still fears even a ruined building. On my side, then, why should
I not contend for these wise and sagacious natures of trees? Let them have vitality, as the
philosophers permit it; but let them have knowledge too, although the philosophers disavow
it. Even the infancy of a log, then, may have an intellect (suitable to it): how much more
may that of a human being, whose soul (which may be compared with the nascent sprout
of a tree) has been derived from Adam as its root, and has been propagated amongst his
posterity by means of woman, to whom it has been entrusted for transmission, and thus
has sprouted into life with all its natural apparatus, both of intellect and of sense! I am much
mistaken if the human person, even from his infancy, when he saluted life with his infant
cries, does not testify to his actual possession of the faculties of sensation and intellect by
the fact of his birth, vindicating at one and the same time the use of all his senses—that of
seeing by the light, that of hearing by sounds, that of taste by liquids, that of smell by the
air, that of touch by the ground. This earliest voice of infancy, then, is the first effort of the
senses, and the initial impulse of mental perceptions.1639 There is also the further fact, that
some persons understand this plaintive cry of the infant to be an augury of affliction in the
prospect of our tearful life, whereby from the very moment of birth (the soul) has to be regarded
as endued with prescience, much more with intelligence. Accordingly by this intuition1640
the babe knows his mother, discerns the nurse, and even recognises the waitingmaid;
refusing the breast of another woman, and the cradle that is not his own, and longing
only for the arms to which he is accustomed. Now from what source does he acquire this
discernment of novelty and custom, if not from instinctive knowledge? How does it happen
that he is irritated and quieted, if not by help of his initial intellect? It would be very strange
indeed that infancy were naturally so lively, if it had not mental power; and naturally so
capable of impression and affection, if it had no intellect. But (we hold the contrary): for
Christ, by “accepting praise out of the mouth of babes and sucklings,”1641 has declared that
neither childhood nor infancy is without sensibility,1642—the former of which states, when

<head>Chapter XX.—The Soul, as to Its Nature Uniform, But Its Faculties Variously Developed.
Varieties Only Accidental.</head>
<p>And here, therefore, we draw our conclusion, that all the natural properties of the soul
are inherent in it as parts of its substance; and that they grow and develope along with it,
from the very moment of its own origin at birth. Just as Seneca says, whom we so often find
on our side:1645 “There are implanted within us the seeds of all the arts and periods of life.
And God, our Master, secretly produces our mental dispositions;” that is, from the germs
which are implanted and hidden in us by means of infancy, and these are the intellect: for
from these our natural dispositions are evolved. Now, even the seeds of plants have, one
form in each kind, but their development varies: some open and expand in a healthy and
perfect state, while others either improve or degenerate, owing to the conditions of weather
and soil, and from the appliance of labour and care; also from the course of the seasons, and
from the occurrence of casual circumstances. In like manner, the soul may well be1646 uniform
in its seminal origin, although multiform by the process of nativity.1647 And here
local influences, too, must be taken into account. It has been said that dull and brutish persons
are born at Thebes; and the most accomplished in wisdom and speech at Athens, where in
the district of Colythus1648 children speak—such is the precocity of their tongue—before
they are a month old. Indeed, Plato himself tells us, in the Timæus, that Minerva, when
preparing to found her great city, only regarded the nature of the country which gave
promise of mental dispositions of this kind; whence he himself in The Laws instructs
Megillus and Clinias to be careful in their selection of a site for building a city. Empedocles,
however, places the cause of a subtle or an obtuse intellect in the quality of the blood, from
which he derives progress and perfection in learning and science. The subject of national
peculiarities has grown by this time into proverbial notoriety. Comic poets deride the
Phrygians for their cowardice; Sallust reproaches the Moors for their levity, and the Dalmatians
for their cruelty; even the apostle brands the Cretans as “liars.”1649 Very likely, too,
something must be set down to the score of bodily condition and the state of the health.
Stoutness hinders knowledge, but a spare form stimulates it; paralysis prostrates the mind,
a decline preserves it. How much more will those accidental circumstances have to be noticed,
which, in addition to the state of one’s body or one’s health, tend to sharpen or to dull the
intellect! It is sharpened by learned pursuits, by the sciences, the arts, by experimental
knowledge, business habits, and studies; it is blunted by ignorance, idle habits, inactivity,

lust, inexperience, listlessness, and vicious pursuits. Then, besides these influences, there
must perhaps1650 be added the supreme powers. Now these are the supreme powers: according
to our (Christian) notions, they are the Lord God and His adversary the devil; but according
to men’s general opinion about providence, they are fate and necessity; and about
fortune, it is man’s freedom of will. Even the philosophers allow these distinctions; whilst
on our part we have already undertaken to treat of them, on the principles of the (Christian)
faith, in a separate work.1651 It is evident how great must be the influences which so variously
affect the one nature of the soul, since they are commonly regarded as separate “natures.”
Still they are not different species, but casual incidents of one nature and substance—even
of that which God conferred on Adam, and made the mould of all (subsequent ones). Casual
incidents will they always remain, but never will they become specific differences.
However great, too, at present is the variety of men’s maunders, it was not so in Adam, the
founder of their race. But all these discordances ought to have existed in him as the fountainhead,
and thence to have descended to us in an unimpaired variety, if the variety had
been due to nature.</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—As Free-Will Actuates an Individual So May His Character Change.</head>
<p>Now, if the soul possessed this uniform and simple nature from the beginning in Adam,
previous to so many mental dispositions (being developed out of it), it is not rendered
multiform by such various development, nor by the triple1652 form predicated of it in “the
Valentinian trinity” (that we may still keep the condemnation of that heresy in view), for
not even this nature is discoverable in Adam. What had he that was spiritual? Is it because
he prophetically declared “the great mystery of Christ and the church?”1653 “This is bone
of my bone, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman. Therefore shall a man leave
his father and mother, and he shall cleave unto his wife; and they two shall be one flesh.”1654
But this (gift of prophecy) only came on him afterwards, when God infused into him the
ecstasy, or spiritual quality, in which prophecy consists. If, again, the evil of sin was developed
in him, this must not be accounted as a natural disposition: it was rather produced by the
instigation of the (old) serpent as far from being incidental to his nature as it was from being
material in him, for we have already excluded belief in “Matter.”1655 Now, if neither the
spiritual element, nor what the heretics call the material element, was properly inherent in
him (since, if he had been created out of matter, the germ of evil must have been an integral
part of his constitution), it remains that the one only original element of his nature was
what is called the animal (the principle of vitality, the soul), which we maintain to be simple
and uniform in its condition. Concerning this, it remains for us to inquire whether, as being
called natural, it ought to be deemed subject to change. (The heretics whom we have referred
to) deny that nature is susceptible of any change,1656 in order that they may be able to establish
and settle their threefold theory, or “trinity,” in all its characteristics as to the several
natures, because “a good tree cannot produce evil fruit, nor a corrupt tree good fruit; and
nobody gathers figs of thorns, nor grapes of brambles.”1657 If so, then “God will not be able
any longer to raise up from the stones children unto Abraham; nor to make a generation
of vipers bring forth fruits of repentance.”1658 And if so, the apostle too was in error when
he said in his epistle, “Ye were at one time darkness, (but now are ye light in the Lord:)”1659
and, “We also were by nature children of wrath;”1660 and, “Such were some of you, but ye

are washed.”1661 The statements, however, of holy Scripture will never be discordant with
truth. A corrupt tree will never yield good fruit, unless the better nature be grafted into it;
nor will a good tree produce evil fruit, except by the same process of cultivation. Stones also
will become children of Abraham, if educated in Abraham’s faith; and a generation of vipers
will bring forth the fruits of penitence, if they reject the poison of their malignant nature.
This will be the power of the grace of God, more potent indeed than nature, exercising its
sway over the faculty that underlies itself within us—even the freedom of our will, which is
described as αὐτεξούσιος (of independent authority); and inasmuch as this faculty is itself
also natural and mutable, in whatsoever direction it turns, it inclines of its own nature. Now,
that there does exist within us naturally this independent authority (τὸ αὐτεξούσιον ), we
have already shown in opposition both to Marcion1662 and to Hermogenes.1663 If, then,
the natural condition has to be submitted to a definition, it must be determined to be twofold—
there being the category of the born and the unborn, the made and not-made. Now
that which has received its constitution by being made or by being born, is by nature capable
of being changed, for it can be both born again and re-made; whereas that which is notmade
and unborn will remain for ever immoveable. Since, however, this state is suited to
God alone, as the only Being who is unborn and not-made (and therefore immortal and
unchangeable), it is absolutely certain that the nature of all other existences which are born
and created is subject to modification and change; so that if the threefold state is to be
ascribed to the soul, it must be supposed to arise from the mutability of its accidental circumstances,
and not from the appointment of nature.</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—Recapitulation. Definition of the Soul.</head>
<p>Hermogenes has already heard from us what are the other natural faculties of the soul,
as well as their vindication and proof; whence it may be seen that the soul is rather the offspring
of God than of matter. The names of these faculties shall here be simply repeated,
that they may not seem to be forgotten and passed out of sight. We have assigned, then, to
the soul both that freedom of the will which we just now mentioned, and its dominion over
the works of nature, and its occasional gift of divination, independently of that endowment
of prophecy which accrues to it expressly from the grace of God. We shall therefore now
quit this subject of the soul’s disposition, in order to set out fully in order its various qualities.
1664 The soul, then, we define to be sprung from the breath of God, immortal, possessing
body, having form, simple in its substance, intelligent in its own nature, developing its power
in various ways, free in its determinations, subject to be changes of accident, in its faculties
mutable, rational, supreme, endued with an instinct of presentiment, evolved out of one
(archetypal soul). It remains for us now to consider how it is developed out of this one original
source; in other words, whence, and when, and how it is produced.</p>
<note type="footnote">1664 Tertullian had shown that “the soul is the breath or afflatus of God,” in ch. iv. and xi. above. He
demonstrated its “immortality” in ch. ii.–iv., vi., ix., xiv.; and he will repeat his proof hereafter, in ch. xxiv.,
xxxviii., xlv., li., liii., liv. Moreover, he illustrates the soul’s “corporeity” in ch. v.–viii.; its “endowment with form
or figure,” in ch. ix.; its “simplicity in substance” in ch. x. and xi.; its “inherent intelligence,” in ch. xii.; its varied
development, in ch. xiii.–xv. The soul’s “rationality,” “supremacy,” and “instinctive divination,” Tertullian treated
of in his treatise De Censu Animæ against Hermogenes (as he has said in the text); but he has treated somewhat
of the soul’s “rational nature” in the sixteenth chapter above; in the fourteenth and fifteenth chapters he referred
to the soul’s “supremacy or hegemony;” whilst we have had a hint about its “divining faculty,” even in infants,
in ch. xix. The propagation of souls from the one archetypal soul is the subject of the chapter before us, as well
as of the five succeeding ones (La Cerda).</note>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—The Opinions of Sundry Heretics Which Originate Ultimately with
Plato.</head>
<p>Some suppose that they came down from heaven, with as firm a belief as they are apt
to entertain, when they indulge in the prospect of an undoubted return thither. Saturninus,
the disciple of Menander, who belonged to Simon’s sect, introduced this opinion: he affirmed
that man was made by angels. A futile, imperfect creation at first, weak and unable to stand,
he crawled upon the ground like a worm, because he wanted the strength to maintain an
erect posture; but afterwards having, by the compassion of the Supreme Power (in whose
image, which had not been fully understood, he was clumsily formed), obtained a slender
spark of life, this roused and righted his imperfect form, and animated it with a higher vitality,
and provided for its return, on its relinquishment of life, to its original principle. Carpocrates,
indeed, claims for himself so extreme an amount of the supernal qualities, that his disciples
set their own souls at once on an equality with Christ (not to mention the apostles); and
sometimes, when it suits their fancy, even give them the superiority—deeming them, forsooth,
to have partaken of that sublime virtue which looks down upon the principalities that govern
this world. Apelles tells us that our souls were enticed by earthly baits down from their supercelestial
abodes by a fiery angel, Israel’s God and ours, who then enclosed them firmly
within our sinful flesh. The hive of Valentinus fortifies the soul with the germ of Sophia, or
Wisdom; by means of which germ they recognise, in the images of visible objects, the stories
and Milesian fables of their own Æons. I am sorry from my heart that Plato has been the
caterer to all these heretics. For in the Phædo he imagines that souls wander from this world
to that, and thence back again hither; whilst in the Timæus he supposes that the children of
God, to whom had been assigned the production of mortal creatures, having taken for the
soul the germ of immortality, congealed around it a mortal body,—thereby indicating that
this world is the figure of some other. Now, to procure belief in all this—that the soul had
formerly lived with God in the heavens above, sharing His ideas with Him, and afterwards
came down to live with us on earth, and whilst here recollects the eternal patterns of things
which it had learnt before—he elaborated his new formula, μαθήσεις ἀναμνήσεις, which
means that “learning is reminiscence;” implying that the souls which come to us from thence
forget the things amongst which they formerly lived, but that they afterwards recall them,
instructed by the objects they see around them. Forasmuch, therefore, as the doctrines which
the heretics borrow from Plato are cunningly defended by this kind of argument, I shall
sufficiently refute the heretics if I overthrow the argument of Plato.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—Plato’s Inconsistency. He Supposes the Soul Self-Existent, Yet
Capable of Forgetting What Passed in a Previous State.</head>
<p>In the first place, I cannot allow that the soul is capable of a failure of memory; because
he has conceded to it so large an amount of divine quality as to put it on a par with God.
He makes it unborn, which single attribute I might apply as a sufficient attestation of its
perfect divinity; he then adds that the soul is immortal, incorruptible, incorporeal—since
he believed God to be the same—invisible, incapable of delineation, uniform, supreme, rational,
and intellectual. What more could he attribute to the soul, if he wanted to call it God?
We, however, who allow no appendage to God1665 (in the sense of equality), by this very
fact reckon the soul as very far below God: for we suppose it to be born, and hereby to possess
something of a diluted divinity and an attenuated felicity, as the breath (of God), though
not His spirit; and although immortal, as this is an attribute of divinity, yet for all that
passible, since this is an incident of a born condition, and consequently from the first capable
of deviation from perfection and right,1666 and by consequence susceptible of a failure in
memory. This point I have discussed sufficiently with Hermogenes.1667 But it may be further
observed, that if the soul is to merit being accounted a god, by reason of all its qualities being
equal to the attributes of God, it must then be subject to no passion, and therefore to no
loss of memory; for this defect of oblivion is as great an injury to that of which you predicate
it, as memory is the glory thereof, which Plato himself deems the very safeguard of the senses
and intellectual faculties, and which Cicero has designated the treasury of all the sciences.
Now we need not raise the doubt whether so divine a faculty as the soul was capable of losing
memory: the question rather is, whether it is able to recover afresh that which it has lost. I
could not decide whether that, which ought to have lost memory, if it once incurred the
loss, would be powerful enough to recollect itself. Both alternatives, indeed, will agree very
well with my soul, but not with Plato’s. In the second place, my objection to him will stand
thus: (Plato,) do you endow the soul with a natural competency for understanding those
well-known ideas of yours? Certainly I do, will be your answer. Well, now, no one will
concede to you that the knowledge, (which you say is) the gift of nature, of the natural sciences
can fail. But the knowledge of the sciences fails; the knowledge of the various fields
of learning and of the arts of life fails; and so perhaps the knowledge of the faculties and affections
of our minds fails, although they seem to be inherent in our nature, but really are
not so: because, as we have already said,1668 they are affected by accidents of place, of
manners and customs, of bodily condition, of the state of man’s health—by the influences

<pb n="429"/>
of the Supreme Powers, and the changes of man’s free-will. Now the instinctive knowledge
of natural objects never fails, not even in the brute creation. The lion, no doubt, will forget
his ferocity, if surrounded by the softening influence of training; he may become, with his
beautiful mane, the plaything of some Queen Berenice, and lick her cheeks with his tongue.
A wild beast may lay aside his habits, but his natural instincts will not be forgotten. He will
not forget his proper food, nor his natural resources, nor his natural alarms; and should the
queen offer him fishes or cakes, he will wish for flesh; and if, when he is ill, any antidote be
prepared for him, he will still require the ape; and should no hunting-spear be presented
against him, he will yet dread the crow of the cock. In like manner with man, who is perhaps
the most forgetful of all creatures, the knowledge of everything natural to him will remain
ineradicably fixed in him,—but this alone, as being alone a natural instinct. He will never
forget to eat when he is hungry; or to drink when he is thirsty; or to use his eyes when he
wants to see; or his ears, to hear; or his nose, to smell; or his mouth, to taste; or his hand, to
touch. These are, to be sure, the senses, which philosophy depreciates by her preference for
the intellectual faculties. But if the natural knowledge of the sensuous faculties is permanent,
how happens it that the knowledge of the intellectual faculties fails, to which the superiority
is ascribed? Whence, now, arises that power of forgetfulness itself which precedes recollection?
From long lapse of time, he says. But this is a shortsighted answer. Length of time
cannot be incidental to that which, according to him, is unborn, and which therefore must
be deemed most certainly eternal. For that which is eternal, on the ground of its being unborn,
since it admits neither of beginning nor end of time, is subject to no temporal criterion. And
that which time does not measure, undergoes no change in consequence of time; nor is long
lapse of time at all influential over it. If time is a cause of oblivion, why, from the time of
the soul’s entrance into the body, does memory fail, as if thenceforth the soul were to be
affected by time? for the soul, being undoubtedly prior to the body, was of course not irrespective
of time. Is it, indeed, immediately on the soul’s entrance into the body that oblivion
takes place, or some time afterwards? If immediately, where will be the long lapse of the
time which is as yet inadmissible in the hypothesis?1669 Take, for instance, the case of the
infant. If some time afterwards, will not the soul, during the interval previous to the moment
of oblivion, still exercise its powers of memory? And how comes it to pass that the soul
subsequently forgets, and then afterwards again remembers? How long, too, must the lapse
of the time be regarded as having been, during which the oblivion oppressed the soul? The
whole course of one’s life, I apprehend, will be insufficient to efface the memory of an age
which endured so long before the soul’s assumption of the body. But then, again, Plato
throws the blame upon the body, as if it were at all credible that a born substance could extinguish
the power of one that is unborn. There exist, however, among bodies a great many
<note type="footnote">1669 Or, “which has been too short for calculation.”</note>

<pb n="430"/>
differences, by reason of their rationality, their bulk, their condition, their age, and their
health. Will there then be supposed to exist similar differences in obliviousness? Oblivion,
however, is uniform and identical. Therefore bodily peculiarity, with its manifold varieties,
will not become the cause of an effect which is an invariable one. There are likewise, according
to Plato’s own testimony, many proofs to show that the soul has a divining faculty, as we
have already advanced against Hermogenes. But there is not a man living, who does not
himself feel his soul possessed with a presage and augury of some omen, danger, or joy.
Now, if the body is not prejudicial to divination, it will not, I suppose, be injurious to memory.
One thing is certain, that souls in the same body both forget and remember. If any corporeal
condition engenders forgetfulness, how will it admit the opposite state of recollection? Be-
cause recollection, after forgetfulness, is actually the resurrection of the memory. Now, how
should not that which is hostile to the memory at first, be also prejudicial to it in the second
instance? Lastly, who have better memories than little children, with their fresh, unworn
souls, not yet immersed in domestic and public cares, but devoted only to those studies the
acquirement of which is itself a reminiscence? Why, indeed, do we not all of us recollect in
an equal degree, since we are equal in our forgetfulness? But this is true only of philosophers!
But not even of the whole of them. Amongst so many nations, in so great a crowd of sages,
Plato, to be sure, is the only man who has combined the oblivion and the recollection of
ideas. Now, since this main argument of his by no means keeps its ground, it follows that
its entire superstructure must fall with it, namely, that souls are supposed to be unborn, and
to live in the heavenly regions, and to be instructed in the divine mysteries thereof; moreover,
that they descend to this earth, and here recall to memory their previous existence, for the
purpose, of course, of supplying to our heretics the fitting materials for their systems.</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—Tertullian Refutes, Physiologically, the Notion that the Soul is Introduced
After Birth.</head>
<p>I shall now return to the cause of this digression, in order that I may explain how all
souls are derived from one, when and where and in what manner they are produced. Now,
touching this subject, it matters not whether the question be started by the philosopher, by
the heretic, or by the crowd. Those who profess the truth care nothing about their opponents,
especially such of them as begin by maintaining that the soul is not conceived in the womb,
nor is formed and produced at the time that the flesh is moulded, but is impressed from
without upon the infant before his complete vitality, but after the process of parturition.
They say, moreover, that the human seed having been duly deposited ex concubiterin the
womb, and having been by natural impulse quickened, it becomes condensed into the mere
substance of the flesh, which is in due time born, warm from the furnace of the womb, and
then released from its heat. (This flesh) resembles the case of hot iron, which is in that state
plunged into cold water; for, being smitten by the cold air (into which it is born), it at once
receives the power of animation, and utters vocal sound. This view is entertained by the
Stoics, along with Ænesidemus, and occasionally by Plato himself, when he tells us that the
soul, being quite a separate formation, originating elsewhere and externally to the womb,
is inhaled1670 when the new-born infant first draws breath, and by and by exhaled1671 with
the man’s latest breath. We shall see whether this view of his is merely fictitious. Even the
medical profession has not lacked its Hicesius, to prove a traitor both to nature and his own
calling. These gentlemen, I suppose, were too modest to come to terms with women on the
mysteries of childbirth, so well known to the latter. But how much more is there for them
to blush at, when in the end they have the women to refute them, instead of commending
them. Now, in such a question as this, no one can be so useful a teacher, judge, or witness,
as the sex itself which is so intimately concerned. Give us your testimony, then, ye mothers,
whether yet pregnant, or after delivery (let barren women and men keep silence),—the truth
of your own nature is in question, the reality of your own suffering is the point to be decided.
(Tell us, then,) whether you feel in the embryo within you any vital force1672 other than
your own, with which your bowels tremble, your sides shake, your entire womb throbs, and
the burden which oppresses you constantly changes its position? Are these movements a
joy to you, and a positive removal of anxiety, as making you confident that your infant both
possesses vitality and enjoys it? Or, should his restlessness cease, your first fear would be
for him; and he would be aware of it within you, since he is disturbed at the novel sound;

and you would crave for injurious diet,1673 or would even loathe your food—all on his account;
and then you and he, (in the closeness of your sympathy,) would share together your
common ailments—so far that with your contusions and bruises would he actually become
marked,—whilst within you, and even on the selfsame parts of the body, taking to himself
thus peremptorily1674 the injuries of his mother! Now, whenever a livid hue and redness
are incidents of the blood, the blood will not be without the vital principle,1675 or soul; or
when disease attacks the soul or vitality, (it becomes a proof of its real existence, since) there
is no disease where there is no soul or principle of life. Again, inasmuch as sustenance by
food, and the want thereof, growth and decay, fear and motion, are conditions of the soul
or life, he who experiences them must be alive. And, so, he at last ceases to live, who ceases
to experience them. And thus by and by infants are still-born; but how so, unless they had
life? For how could any die, who had not previously lived? But sometimes by a cruel necessity,
whilst yet in the womb, an infant is put to death, when lying awry in the orifice of the womb
he impedes parturition, and kills his mother, if he is not to die himself. Accordingly, among
surgeons’ tools there is a certain instrument, which is formed with a nicely-adjusted flexible
frame for opening the uterus first of all, and keeping it open; it is further furnished with an
annular blade,1676 by means of which the limbs within the womb are dissected with anxious
but unfaltering care; its last appendage being a blunted or covered hook, wherewith the
entire foetus is extracted1677 by a violent delivery. There is also (another instrument in the
shape of) a copper needle or spike, by which the actual death is managed in this furtive
robbery of life: they give it, from its infanticide function, the name of ἐμβρυοσφάκτης , the
slayer of the infant, which was of course alive. Such apparatus was possessed both by Hippocrates,
and Asclepiades, and Erasistratus, and Herophilus, that dissector of even adults,
and the milder Soranus himself, who all knew well enough that a living being had been
conceived, and pitied this most luckless infant state, which had first to be put to death, to
escape being tortured alive. Of the necessity of such harsh treatment I have no doubt even
Hicesius was convinced, although he imported their soul into infants after birth from the
stroke of the frigid air, because the very term for soul, forsooth, in Greek answered to such
a refrigeration!1678 Well, then, have the barbarian and Roman nations received souls by
some other process, (I wonder;) for they have called the soul by another name than ψυχή?

zone, scorching their skin into its swarthy hue? Whence do they get their souls, with no
frosty air to help them? I say not a word of those well-warmed bed-rooms, and all that apparatus
of heat which ladies in childbirth so greatly need, when a breath of cold air might
endanger their life. But in the very bath almost a babe will slip into life, and at once his cry
is heard! If, however, a good frosty air is to the soul so indispensable a treasure, then beyond
the German and the Scythian tribes, and the Alpine and the Argæan heights, nobody ought
ever to be born! But the fact really is, that population is greater within the temperate regions
of the East and the West, and men’s minds are sharper; whilst there is not a Sarmatian whose
wits are not dull and humdrum. The minds of men, too, would grow keener by reason of
the cold, if their souls came into being amidst nipping frosts; for as the substance is, so must
be its active power. Now, after these preliminary statements, we may also refer to the case
of those who, having been cut out of their mother’s womb, have breathed and retained
life—your Bacchuses1680 and Scipios.1681 If, however, there be any one who, like Plato,1682
supposes that two souls cannot, more than two bodies could, co-exist in the same individual,
I, on the contrary, could show him not merely the co-existence of two souls in one person,
as also of two bodies in the same womb, but likewise the combination of many other things
in natural connection with the soul—for instance, of demoniacal possession; and that not
of one only, as in the case of Socrates’ own demon; but of seven spirits as in the case of the
Magdalene;1683 and of a legion in number, as in the Gadarene.1684 Now one soul is naturally
more susceptible of conjunction with another soul, by reason of the identity of their substance,
than an evil spirit is, owing to their diverse natures. But when the same philosopher,
in the sixth book of The Laws, warns us to beware lest a vitiation of seed should infuse a soil
into both body and soul from an illicit or debased concubinage, I hardly know whether he
is more inconsistent with himself in respect of one of his previous statements, or of that
which he had just made. For he here shows us that the soul proceeds from human seed (and
warns us to be on our guard about it), not, (as he had said before,) from the first breath of
the new-born child. Pray, whence comes it that from similarity of soul we resemble our
parents in disposition, according to the testimony of Cleanthes,1685 if we are not produced
from this seed of the soul? Why, too, used the old astrologers to cast a man’s nativity from
his first conception, if his soul also draws not its origin from that moment? To this (nativity)
likewise belongs the inbreathing of the soul, whatever that is.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—Scripture Alone Offers Clear Knowledge on the Questions We
Have Been Controverting.</head>
<p>Now there is no end to the uncertainty and irregularity of human opinion, until we
come to the limits which God has prescribed. I shall at last retire within our own lines and
firmly hold my ground there, for the purpose of proving to the Christian (the soundness
of) my answers to the Philosophers and the Physicians. Brother (in Christ), on your own
foundation1686 build up your faith. Consider the wombs of the most sainted women instinct
with the life within them, and their babes which not only breathed therein, but were even
endowed with prophetic intuition. See how the bowels of Rebecca are disquieted,1687 though
her child-bearing is as yet remote, and there is no impulse of (vital) air. Behold, a twin offspring
chafes within the mother’s womb, although she has no sign as yet of the twofold nation.
Possibly we might have regarded as a prodigy the contention of this infant progeny, which
struggled before it lived, which had animosity previous to animation, if it had simply disturbed
the mother by its restlessness within her. But when her womb opens, and the number
of her offspring is seen, and their presaged condition known, we have presented to us a
proof not merely of the (separate) souls of the infants, but of their hostile struggles too. He
who was the first to be born was threatened with detention by him who was anticipated in
birth, who was not yet fully brought forth, but whose hand only had been born. Now if he
actually imbibed life, and received his soul, in Platonic style, at his first breath; or else, after
the Stoic rule, had the earliest taste of animation on touching the frosty air; what was the
other about, who was so eagerly looked for, who was still detained within the womb, and
was trying to detain (the other) outside? I suppose he had not yet breathed when he seized
his brother’s heel;1688 and was still warm with his mother’s warmth, when he so strongly
wished to be the first to quit the womb. What an infant! so emulous, so strong, and already
so contentious; and all this, I suppose, because even now full of life! Consider, again, those
extraordinary conceptions, which were more wonderful still, of the barren woman and the
virgin: these women would only be able to produce imperfect offspring against the course
of nature, from the very fact that one of them was too old to bear seed, and the other was
pure from the contact of man. If there was to be bearing at all in the case, it was only fitting
that they should be born without a soul, (as the philosopher would say,) who had been irregularly
conceived. However, even these have life, each of them in his mother’s womb. Elizabeth
exults with joy, (for) John had leaped in her womb;1689 Mary magnifies the Lord, (for) Christ

had instigated her within.1690 The mothers recognise each their own offspring, being
moreover each recognised by their infants, which were therefore of course alive, and were
not souls merely, but spirits also. Accordingly you read the word of God which was spoken
to Jeremiah, “Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee.”1691 Since God forms us in the
womb, He also breathes upon us, as He also did at the first creation, when “the Lord God
formed man, and breathed into him the breath of life.”1692 Nor could God have known man
in the womb, except in his entire nature: “And before thou camest forth out of the womb,
I sanctified thee.”1693 Well, was it then a dead body at that early stage? Certainly not. For
“God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXVII.—Soul and Body Conceived, Formed and Perfected in Element
Simultaneously.</head>
<p>How, then, is a living being conceived? Is the substance of both body and soul formed
together at one and the same time? Or does one of them precede the other in natural formation?
We indeed maintain that both are conceived, and formed, and perfectly simultaneously,
as well as born together; and that not a moment’s interval occurs in their conception,
so that, a prior place can be assigned to either.1694 Judge, in fact, of the incidents of man’s
earliest existence by those which occur to him at the very last. As death is defined to be
nothing else than the separation of body and soul,1695 life, which is the opposite of death,
is susceptible of no other definition than the conjunction of body and soul. If the severance
happens at one and the same time to both substances by means of death, so the law of their
combination ought to assure us that it occurs simultaneously to the two substances by means
of life. Now we allow that life begins with conception, because we contend that the soul also
begins from conception; life taking its commencement at the same moment and place that
the soul does. Thus, then, the processes which act together to produce separation by death,
also combine in a simultaneous action to produce life. If we assign priority to (the formation
of) one of the natures, and a subsequent time to the other, we shall have further to determine
the precise times of the semination, according to the condition and rank of each. And that
being so, what time shall we give to the seed of the body, and what to the seed of the soul?
Besides, if different periods are to be assigned to the seminations then arising out of this
difference in time, we shall also have different substances.1696 For although we shall allow
that there are two kinds of seed—that of the body and that of the soul—we still declare that
they are inseparable, and therefore contemporaneous and simultaneous in origin. Now let
no one take offence or feel ashamed at an interpretation of the processes of nature which is
rendered necessary (by the defence of the truth). Nature should be to us an object of reverence,
not of blushes. It is lust, not natural usage, which has brought shame on the intercourse
of the sexes. It is the excess, not the normal state, which is immodest and unchaste: the
normal condition has received a blessing from God, and is blest by Him: “Be fruitful, and
multiply, (and replenish the earth.)”1697 Excess, however, has He cursed, in adulteries, and
wantonness, and chambering.1698 Well, now, in this usual function of the sexes which brings
together the male and the female in their common intercourse, we know that both the soul
and the flesh discharge a duty together: the soul supplies desire, the flesh contributes the

gratification of it; the soul furnishes the instigation, the flesh affords the realization. The
entire man being excited by the one effort of both natures, his seminal substance is discharged,
deriving its fluidity from the body, and its warmth from the soul. Now if the soul
in Greek is a word which is synonymous with cold,1699 how does it come to pass that the
body grows cold after the soul has quitted it? Indeed (if I run the risk of offending modesty
even, in my desire to prove the truth), I cannot help asking, whether we do not, in that very
heat of extreme gratification when the generative fluid is ejected, feel that somewhat of our
soul has gone from us? And do we not experience a faintness and prostration along with a
dimness of sight? This, then, must be the soul-producing seed, which arises at once from
the out-drip of the soul, just as that fluid is the body-producing seed which proceeds from
the drainage of the flesh. Most true are the examples of the first creation. Adam’s flesh was
formed of clay. Now what is clay but an excellent moisture, whence should spring the generating
fluid? From the breath of God first came the soul. But what else is the breath of God
than the vapour of the spirit, whence should spring that which we breathe out through the
generative fluid? Forasmuch, therefore, as these two different and separate substances, the
clay and the breath, combined at the first creation in forming the individual man, they then
both amalgamated and mixed their proper seminal rudiments in one, and ever afterwards
communicated to the human race the normal mode of its propagation, so that even now
the two substances, although diverse from each other, flow forth simultaneously in a united
channel; and finding their way together into their appointed seed-plot, they fertilize with
their combined vigour the human fruit out of their respective natures. And inherent in this
human product is his own seed, according to the process which has been ordained for every
creature endowed with the functions of generation. Accordingly from the one (primeval)
man comes the entire outflow and redundance of men’s souls—nature proving herself true
to the commandment of God, “Be fruitful, and multiply.”1700 For in the very preamble of
this one production, “Let us make man,”1701 man’s whole posterity was declared and described
in a plural phrase, “Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,” etc.1702 And
no wonder: in the seed lies the promise and earnest of the crop.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVIII.—The Pythagorean Doctrine of Transmigration Sketched and
Censured.</head>
<p>What, then, by this time means that ancient saying, mentioned by Plato,1703 concerning
the reciprocal migration of souls; how they remove hence and go thither, and then return
hither and pass through life, and then again depart from this life, and afterwards become
alive from the dead? Some will have it that this is a saying of Pythagoras; Albinus supposes
it to be a divine announcement, perhaps of the Egyptian Mercury.1704 But there is no divine
saying, except of the one true God, by whom the prophets, and the apostles, and Christ
Himself declared their grand message. More ancient than Saturn a good deal (by some nine
hundred years or so), and even than his grandchildren, is Moses; and he is certainly much
more divine, recounting and tracing out, as he does, the course of the human race from the
very beginning of the world, indicating the several births (of the fathers of mankind) according
to their names and their epochs; giving thus plain proof of the divine character of his
work, from its divine authority and word. If, indeed, the sophist of Samos is Plato’s authority
for the eternally revolving migration of souls out of a constant alternation of the dead and
the living states, then no doubt did the famous Pythagoras, however excellent in other respects,
for the purpose of fabricating such an opinion as this, rely on a falsehood, which was
not only shameful, but also hazardous. Consider it, you that are ignorant of it, and believe
with us. He feigns death, he conceals himself underground, he condemns himself to that
endurance for some seven years, during which he learns from his mother, who was his sole
accomplice and attendant, what he was to relate for the belief of the world concerning those
who had died since his seclusion;1705 and when he thought that he had succeeded in reducing
the frame of his body to the horrid appearance of a dead old man, he comes forth from the
place of his concealment and deceit, and pretends to have returned from the dead. Who
would hesitate about believing that the man, whom he had supposed to have died, was come
back again to life? especially after hearing from him facts about the recently dead,1706 which
he evidently could only have discovered in Hades itself! Thus, that men are made alive after
death, is rather an old statement. But what if it be rather a recent one also? The truth does
not desire antiquity, nor does falsehood shun novelty. This notable saying I hold to be plainly
false, though ennobled by antiquity. How should that not be false, which depends for its
evidence on a falsehood?—How can I help believing Pythagoras to be a deceiver, who
practises deceit to win my belief? How will he convince me that, before he was Pythagoras,
he had been Æthalides, and Euphorbus, and the fisherman Pyrrhus, and Hermotimus, to

make us believe that men live again after they have died, when he actually perjured himself
afterwards as Pythagoras. In proportion as it would be easier for me to believe that he had
returned once to life in his own person, than so often in the person of this man and that, in
the same degree has he deceived me in things which are too hard to be credited, because he
has played the impostor in matters which might be readily believed. Well, but he recognised
the shield of Euphorbus, which had been formerly consecrated at Delphi, and claimed it as
his own, and proved his claim by signs which were generally unknown. Now, look again at
his subterranean lurking-place, and believe his story, if you can. For, as to the man who
devised such a tricksty scheme, to the injury of his health, fraudulently wasting his life, and
torturing it for seven years underground, amidst hunger, idleness, and darkness—with a
profound disgust for the mighty sky—what reckless effort would he not make, what curious
contrivance would he not attempt, to arrive at the discovery of this famous shield? Suppose
now, that he found it in some of those hidden researches; suppose that he recovered some
slight breath of report which survived the now obsolete tradition; suppose him to have come
to the knowledge of it by an inspection which he had bribed the beadle to let him have,—we
know very well what are the resources of magic skill for exploring hidden secrets: there are
the catabolic spirits, which floor their victims;1707 and the paredral spirits, which are ever
at their side1708 to haunt them; and the pythonic spirits, which entrance them by their
divination and ventriloquistic1709 arts. For was it not likely that Pherecydes also, the master
of our Pythagoras, used to divine, or I would rather say rave and dream, by such arts and
contrivances as these? Might not the self-same demon have been in him, who, whilst in
Euphorbus, transacted deeds of blood? But lastly, why is it that the man, who proved himself
to have been Euphorbus by the evidence of the shield, did not also recognise any of his
former Trojan comrades? For they, too, must by this time have recovered life, since men
were rising again from the dead.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIX.—The Pythagorean Doctrine Refuted by Its Own First Principle, that
Living Men are Formed from the Dead.</head>
<p>It is indeed, manifest that dead men are formed from living ones; but it does not follow
from that, that living men are formed from dead ones. For from the beginning the living
came first in the order of things, and therefore also from the beginning the dead came afterwards
in order. But these proceeded from no other source except from the living. The living
had their origin in any other source (you please) than in the dead; whilst the dead had no
source whence to derive their beginning, except from the living. If, then, from the very first
the living came not from the dead, why should they afterwards (be said to) come from the
dead? Had that original source, whatever it was, come to an end? Was the form or law
thereof a matter for regret? Then why was it preserved in the case of the dead? Does it not
follow that, because the dead came from the living at the first, therefore they always came
from the living? For either the law which obtained at the beginning must have continued
in both of its relations, or else it must have changed in both; so that, if it had become necessary
for the living afterwards to proceed from the dead, it would be necessary, in like manner,
for the dead also not to proceed from the living. For if a faithful adherence to the institution
was not meant to be perpetuated in each respect, then contraries cannot in due alternation
continue to be re-formed from contraries. We, too, will on our side adduce against you
certain contraries, of the born and the unborn, of vision1710 and blindness, of youth and
old age, of wisdom and folly. Now it does not follow that the unborn proceeds from the
born, on the ground that a contrary issues from a contrary; nor, again, that vision proceeds
from blindness, because blindness happens to vision; nor, again, that youth revives from
old age, because after youth comes the decrepitude of senility; nor that folly1711 is born with
its obtuseness from wisdom, because wisdom may possibly be sometimes sharpened out of
folly. Albinus has some fears for his (master and friend) Plato in these points, and labours
with much ingenuity to distinguish different kinds of contraries; as if these instances did
not as absolutely partake of the nature of contrariety as those which are expounded by him
to illustrate his great master’s principle—I mean, life and death. Nor is it, for the matter of
that, true that life is restored out of death, because it happens that death succeeds1712 life.</p>

Civilisation.</head>
<p>But what must we say in reply to what follows? For, in the first place, if the living come
from the dead, just as the dead proceed from the living, then there must always remain unchanged
one and the selfsame number of mankind, even the number which originally introduced
(human) life. The living preceded the dead, afterwards the dead issued from the living,
and then again the living from the dead. Now, since this process was evermore going on
with the same persons, therefore they, issuing from the same, must always have remained
in number the same. For they who emerged (into life) could never have become more nor
fewer than they who disappeared (in death). We find, however, in the records of the Antiquities
of Man,1713 that the human race has progressed with a gradual growth of population,
either occupying different portions of the earth as aborigines, or as nomad tribes, or as exiles,
or as conquerors—as the Scythians in Parthia, the Temenidæ in Peloponnesus, the Athenians
in Asia, the Phrygians in Italy, and the Phoenicians in Africa; or by the more ordinary
methods of migration, which they call ἀποικίαι or colonies, for the purpose of throwing off
redundant population, disgorging into other abodes their overcrowded masses. The aborigines
remain still in their old settlements, and have also enriched other districts with loans
of even larger populations. Surely it is obvious enough, if one looks at the whole world, that
it is becoming daily better cultivated and more fully peopled than anciently. All places are
now accessible, all are well known, all open to commerce; most pleasant farms have obliterated
all traces of what were once dreary and dangerous wastes; cultivated fields have subdued
forests; flocks and herds have expelled wild beasts; sandy deserts are sown; rocks are planted;
marshes are drained; and where once were hardly solitary cottages, there are now large cities.
No longer are (savage) islands dreaded, nor their rocky shores feared; everywhere are houses,
and inhabitants, and settled government, and civilized life. What most frequently meets our
view (and occasions complaint), is our teeming population: our numbers are burdensome
to the world, which can hardly supply us from its natural elements; our wants grow more
and more keen, and our complaints more bitter in all mouths, whilst Nature fails in affording
us her usual sustenance. In very deed, pestilence, and famine, and wars, and earthquakes
have to be regarded as a remedy for nations, as the means of pruning the luxuriance of the
human race; and yet, when the hatchet has once felled large masses of men, the world has
hitherto never once been alarmed at the sight of a restitution of its dead coming back to life
after their millennial exile.1714 But such a spectacle would have become quite obvious by
<note type="footnote">1713 A probable allusion to Varro’s work, De Antiqq. Rerum Humanarum.</note>
<note type="footnote">1714 An allusion to Plato’s notion that, at the end of a thousand years, such a restoration of the dead, took

the balance of mortal loss and vital recovery, if it were true that the dead came back again
to life. Why, however, is it after a thousand years, and not at the moment, that this return
from death is to take place, when, supposing that the loss is not at once supplied, there must
be a risk of an utter extinction, as the failure precedes the compensation? Indeed, this furlough
of our present life would be quite disproportioned to the period of a thousand years; so
much briefer is it, and on that account so much more easily is its torch extinguished than
rekindled. Inasmuch, then, as the period which, on the hypothesis we have discussed, ought
to intervene, if the living are to be formed from the dead, has not actually occurred, it will
follow that we must not believe that men come back to life from the dead (in the way surmised
in this philosophy).</p>

<head>Chapter XXXI.—Further Exposure of Transmigration, Its Inextricable Embarrassment.</head>
<p>Again, if this recovery of life from the dead take place at all, individuals must of course
resume their own individuality. Therefore the souls which animated each several body must
needs have returned separately to their several bodies. Now, whenever two, or three, or five
souls are re-enclosed (as they constantly are) in one womb, it will not amount in such cases
to life from the dead, because there is not the separate restitution which individuals ought
to have; although at this rate, (no doubt,) the law of the primeval creation is signally kept,1715
by the production still of several souls out of only one! Then, again, if souls depart at different
ages of human life, how is it that they come back again at one uniform age? For all men are
imbued with an infant soul at their birth. But how happens it that a man who dies in old
age returns to life as an infant? If the soul, whilst disembodied, decreases thus by retrogression
of its age, how much more reasonable would it be, that it should resume its life with a richer
progress in all attainments of life after the lapse of a thousand years! At all events, it should
return with the age it had attained at its death, that it might resume the precise life which
it had relinquished. But even if, at this rate, they should reappear the same evermore in their
revolving cycles, it would be proper for them to bring back with them, if not the selfsame
forms of body, at least their original peculiarities of character, taste, and disposition, because
it would be hardly possible1716 for them to be regarded as the same, if they were deficient
in those characteristics by means of which their identity should be proved. (You, however,
meet me with this question): How can you possibly know, you ask, whether all is not a secret
process? may not the work of a thousand years take from you the power of recognition,
since they return unknown to you? But I am quite certain that such is not the case, for you
yourself present Pythagoras to me as (the restored) Euphorbus. Now look at Euphorbus: he
was evidently possessed of a military and warlike soul, as is proved by the very renown of
the sacred shields. As for Pythagoras, however, he was such a recluse, and so unwarlike, that
he shrank from the military exploits of which Greece was then so full, and preferred to devote
himself, in the quiet retreat of Italy, to the study of geometry, and astrology, and music—the
very opposite to Euphorbus in taste and disposition. Then, again, the Pyrrhus (whom he
represented) spent his time in catching fish; but Pythagoras, on the contrary, would never
touch fish, abstaining from even the taste of them as from animal food. Moreover, Æthalides
and Hermotimus had included the bean amongst the common esculents at meals, while
Pythagoras taught his disciples not even to pass through a plot which was cultivated with
beans. I ask, then, how the same souls are resumed, which can offer no proof of their identity,
<note type="footnote">1715 Signatur. Rigaltius reads “singulatur,” after the Codex Agobard., as meaning, “The single origin of the
human race is in principle maintained,” etc.</note>
<note type="footnote">1716 Temere.</note>

<pb n="444"/>
either by their disposition, or habits, or living? And now, after all, (we find that) only four
souls are mentioned as recovering life1717 out of all the multitudes of Greece. But limiting
ourselves merely to Greece, as if no transmigrations of souls and resumptions of bodies
occurred, and that every day, in every nation, and amongst all ages, ranks, and sexes, how
is it that Pythagoras alone experiences these changes into one personality and another? Why
should not I too undergo them? Or if it be a privilege monopolized by philosophers—and
Greek philosophers only, as if Scythians and Indians had no philosophers—how is it that
Epicurus had no recollection that he had been once another man, nor Chrysippus, nor Zeno,
nor indeed Plato himself, whom we might perhaps have supposed to have been Nestor, from
his honeyed eloquence?</p>

<head>Chapter XXXII.—Empedocles Increased the Absurdity of Pythagoras by Developing
the Posthumous Change of Men into Various Animals.</head>
<p>But the fact is, Empedocles, who used to dream that he was a god, and on that account,
I suppose, disdained to have it thought that he had ever before been merely some hero, declares
in so many words: “I once was Thamnus, and a fish.” Why not rather a melon, seeing
that he was such a fool; or a cameleon, for his inflated brag? It was, no doubt, as a fish (and
a queer one too!) that he escaped the corruption of some obscure grave, when he preferred
being roasted by a plunge into Ætna; after which accomplishment there was an end for ever
to his μετενσωμάτωσις or putting himself into another body—(fit only now for) a light dish
after the roast-meat. At this point, therefore, we must likewise contend against that still
more monstrous presumption, that in the course of the transmigration beasts pass from
human beings, and human beings from beasts. Let (Empedocles’) Thamnuses alone. Our
slight notice of them in passing will be quite enough: (to dwell on them longer will inconvenience
us,) lest we should be obliged to have recourse to raillery and laughter instead of
serious instruction. Now our position is this: that the human soul cannot by any means at
all be transferred to beasts, even when they are supposed to originate, according to the
philosophers, out of the substances of the elements. Now let us suppose that the soul is either
fire, or water, or blood, or spirit, or air, or light; we must not forget that all the animals in
their several kinds have properties which are opposed to the respective elements. There are
the cold animals which are opposed to fire—water-snakes, lizards, salamanders, and what
things soever are produced out of the rival element of water. In like manner, those creatures
are opposite to water which are in their nature dry and sapless; indeed, locusts, butterflies,
and chameleons rejoice in droughts. So, again, such creatures are opposed to blood which
have none of its purple hue, such as snails, worms, and most of the fishy tribes. Then opposed
to spirit are those creatures which seem to have no respiration, being unfurnished with
lungs and windpipes, such as gnats, ants, moths, and minute things of this sort. Opposed,
moreover, to air are those creatures which always live under ground and under water, and
never imbibe air—things of which you are more acquainted with the existence than with
the names. Then opposed to light are those things which are either wholly blind, or possess
eyes for the darkness only, such as moles, bats, and owls. These examples (have I adduced),
that I might illustrate my subject from clear and palpable natures. But even if I could take
in my hand the “atoms” of Epicurus, or if my eye could see the “numbers” of Pythagoras,
or if my foot could stumble against the “ideas” of Plato, or if I could lay hold of the “entelechies”
of Aristotle, the chances would be, that even in these (impalpable) classes I should find
such animals as I must oppose to one another on the ground of their contrariety. For I
maintain that, of whichsoever of the before-mentioned natures the human soul is composed,
it would not have been possible for it to pass for new forms into animals so contrary to each
of the separate natures, and to bestow an origin by its passage on those beings, from which

<pb n="446"/>
it would have to be excluded and rejected rather than to be admitted and received, by reason
of that original contrariety which we have supposed it to possess,1718 and which commits
the bodily substance receiving it to an interminable strife; and then again by reason of the
subsequent contrariety, which results from the development inseparable from each several
nature. Now it is on quite different conditions1719 that the soul of man has had assigned to
it (in individual bodies1720) its abode, and aliment, and order, and sensation, and affection,
and sexual intercourse, and procreation of children; also (on different conditions has it, in
individual bodies, received especial) dispositions, as well as duties to fulfil, likings, dislikes,
vices, desires, pleasures, maladies, remedies—in short, its own modes of living, its own
outlets of death. How, then, shall that (human) soul which cleaves to the earth, and is unable
without alarm to survey any great height, or any considerable depth, and which is also fatigued
if it mounts many steps, and is suffocated if it is submerged in a fish-pond,—(how,
I say, shall a soul which is beset with such weaknesses) mount up at some future stage into
the air in an eagle, or plunge into the sea in an eel? How, again, shall it, after being nourished
with generous and delicate as well as exquisite viands, feed deliberately on, I will not say
husks, but even on thorns, and the wild fare of bitter leaves, and beasts of the dung-hill, and
poisonous worms, if it has to migrate into a goat or into a quail?—nay, it may be, feed on
carrion, even on human corpses in some bear or lion? But how indeed (shall it stoop to
this), when it remembers its own (nature and dignity)? In the same way, you may submit
all other instances to this criterion of incongruity, and so save us from lingering over the
distinct consideration of each of them in turn. Now, whatever may be the measure and
whatever the mode of the human soul, (the question is forced upon us,) what it will do in
far larger animals, or in very diminutive ones? It must needs be, that every individual body
of whatever size is filled up by the soul, and that the soul is entirely covered by the body.
How, therefore, shall a man’s soul fill an elephant? How, likewise, shall it be contracted
within a gnat? If it be so enormously extended or contracted, it will no doubt be exposed to
peril. And this induces me to ask another question: If the soul is by no means capable of
this kind of migration into animals, which are not fitted for its reception, either by the habits
of their bodies or the other laws of their being, will it then undergo a change according to
the properties of various animals, and be adapted to their life, notwithstanding its contrariety
to human life—having, in fact, become contrary to its human self by reason of its utter
change? Now the truth is, if it undergoes such a transformation, and loses what it once was,
the human soul will not be what it was; and if it ceases to be its former self, the metensomatosis,
or adaptation of some other body, comes to nought, and is not of course to be ascribed
<note type="footnote">1718 Hujus.</note>
<note type="footnote">1719 Alias.</note>
<note type="footnote">1720 This is the force of the objective nouns, which are all put in the plural form.</note>

<pb n="447"/>
to the soul which will cease to exist, on the supposition of its complete change. For only
then can a soul be said to experience this process of the metensomatosis, when it undergoes
it by remaining unchanged in its own (primitive) condition. Since, therefore, the soul does
not admit of change, lest it should cease to retain its identity; and yet is unable to remain
unchanged in its original state, because it fails then to receive contrary (bodies),—I still want
to know some credible reason to justify such a transformation as we are discussing. For although
some men are compared to the beasts because of their character, disposition, and
pursuits (since even God says, “Man is like the beasts that perish”1721), it does not on this
account follow that rapacious persons become kites, lewd persons dogs, ill-tempered ones
panthers, good men sheep, talkative ones swallows, and chaste men doves, as if the selfsame
substance of the soul everywhere repeated its own nature in the properties of the animals
(into which it passed). Besides, a substance is one thing, and the nature of that substance is
another thing; inasmuch as the substance is the special property of one given thing, whereas
the nature thereof may possibly belong to many things. Take an example or two. A stone
or a piece of iron is the substance: the hardness of the stone and the iron is the nature of the
substance. Their hardness combines objects by a common quality; their substances keep
them separate. Then, again, there is softness in wool, and softness in a feather: their natural
qualities are alike, (and put them on a par;) their substantial qualities are not alike, (and
keep them distinct.) Thus, if a man likewise be designated a wild beast or a harmless one,
there is not for all that an identity of soul. Now the similarity of nature is even then observed,
when dissimilarity of substance is most conspicuous: for, by the very fact of your judging
that a man resembles a beast, you confess that their soul is not identical; for you say that
they resemble each other, not that they are the same. This is also the meaning of the word
of God (which we have just quoted): it likens man to the beasts in nature, but not in substance.
Besides, God would not have actually made such a comment as this concerning man, if He
had known him to be in substance only bestial.</p>

<head>HChapter XXXIII.—The Judicial Retribution of These Migrations Refuted with Raillery.</head>
<p>Forasmuch as this doctrine is vindicated even on the principle of judicial retribution,
on the pretence that the souls of men obtain as their partners the kind of animals which are
suited to their life and deserts,—as if they ought to be, according to their several characters,
either slain in criminals destined to execution, or reduced to hard work in menials, or fatigued
and wearied in labourers, or foully disgraced in the unclean; or, again, on the same principle,
reserved for honour, and love, and care, and attentive regard in characters most eminent
in rank and virtue, usefulness, and tender sensibility,—I must here also remark, that if souls
undergo a transformation, they will actually not be able to accomplish and experience the
destinies which they shall deserve; and the aim and purpose of judicial recompense will be
brought to nought, as there will be wanting the sense and consciousness of merit and retribution.
And there must be this want of consciousness, if souls lose their condition; and there
must ensue this loss, if they do not continue in one stay. But even if they should have permanency
enough to remain unchanged until the judgment,—a point which Mercurius
Ægyptius recognised, when he said that the soul, after its separation from the body, was not
dissipated back into the soul of the universe, but retained permanently its distinct individuality,
“in order that it might render,” to use his own words, “an account to the Father of
those things which it has done in the body;” —(even supposing all this, I say,) I still want
to examine the justice, the solemnity, the majesty, and the dignity of this reputed judgment
of God, and see whether human judgment has not too elevated a throne in it—exaggerated
in both directions, in its office both of punishments and rewards, too severe in dealing out
its vengeance, and too lavish in bestowing its favour. What do you suppose will become of
the soul of the murderer? (It will animate), I suppose, some cattle destined for the slaughterhouse
and the shambles, that it may itself be killed, even as it has killed; and be itself flayed,
since it has fleeced others; and be itself used for food, since it has cast to the wild beasts the
ill-fated victims whom it once slew in woods and lonely roads. Now, if such be the judicial
retribution which it is to receive, is not such a soul likely to find more of consolation than
of punishment, in the fact that it receives its coup de grâce from the hands of most expert
practitioners—is buried with condiments served in the most piquant styles of an Apicius
or a Lurco, is introduced to the tables of your exquisite Ciceros, is brought up on the most
splendid dishes of a Sylla, finds its obsequies in a banquet, is devoured by respectable
(mouths) on a par with itself, rather than by kites and wolves, so that all may see how it has
got a man’s body for its tomb, and has risen again after returning to its own kindred
race—exulting in the face of human judgments, if it has experienced them? For these barbarous
sentences of death consign to various wild beasts, which are selected and trained
even against their nature for their horrible office the criminal who has committed murder,
even while yet alive; nay, hindered from too easily dying, by a contrivance which retards his
last moment in order to aggravate his punishment. But even if his soul should have anticip-

<pb n="449"/>
ated by its departure the sword’s last stroke, his body at all events must not escape the
weapon: retribution for his own crime is yet exacted by stabbing his throat and stomach,
and piercing his side. After that he is flung into the fire, that his very grave may be
cheated.1722 In no other way, indeed, is a sepulture allowed him. Not that any great care,
after all, is bestowed on his pyre, so that other animals light upon his remains. At any rate,
no mercy is shown to his bones, no indulgence to his ashes, which must be punished with
exposure and nakedness. The vengeance which is inflicted among men upon the homicide
is really as great as that which is imposed by nature. Who would not prefer the justice of
the world, which, as the apostle himself testifies, “beareth not the sword in vain,”1723 and
which is an institute of religion when it severely avenges in defence of human life? When
we contemplate, too, the penalties awarded to other crimes—gibbets, and holocausts, and
sacks, and harpoons, and precipices—who would not think it better to receive his sentence
in the courts of Pythagoras and Empedocles? For even the wretches whom they will send
into the bodies of asses and mules to be punished by drudgery and slavery, how will they
congratulate themselves on the mild labour of the mill and the water-wheel, when they recollect
the mines, and the convict-gangs, and the public works, and even the prisons and
black-holes, terrible in their idle, do-nothing routine? Then, again, in the case of those who,
after a course of integrity, have surrendered their life to the Judge, I likewise look for rewards,
but I rather discover punishments. To be sure, it must be a handsome gain for good men
to be restored to life in any animals whatsoever! Homer, so dreamt Ennius, remembered
that he was once a peacock; however, I cannot for my part believe poets, even when wide
awake. A peacock, no doubt, is a very pretty bird, pluming itself, at will, on its splendid
feathers; but then its wings do not make amends for its voice, which is harsh and unpleasant;
and there is nothing that poets like better than a good song. His transformation, therefore,
into a peacock was to Homer a penalty, not an honour. The world’s remuneration will bring
him a much greater joy, when it lauds him as the father of the liberal sciences; and he will
prefer the ornaments of his fame to the graces of his tail! But never mind! let poets migrate
into peacocks, or into swans, if you like, especially as swans have a respectable voice: in what
animal will you invest that righteous hero Æacus? In what beast will you clothe the chaste
and excellent Dido? What bird shall fall to the lot of Patience? what animal to the lot of
Holiness? what fish to that of Innocence? Now all creatures are the servants of man; all are
his subjects, all his dependants. If by and by he is to become one of these creatures, he is by
such a change debased and degraded, he to whom, for his virtues, images, statues, and titles
are freely awarded as public honours and distinguished privileges, he to whom the senate
and the people vote even sacrifices! Oh, what judicial sentences for gods to pronounce, as

men’s recompense after death! They are more mendacious than any human judgments;
they are contemptible as punishments, disgusting as rewards; such as the worst of men could
never fear, nor the best desire; such indeed, as criminals will aspire to, rather than saints,—the
former, that they may escape more speedily the world’s stern sentence,—the latter that they
may more tardily incur it. How well, (forsooth), O ye philosophers do you teach us, and
how usefully do you advise us, that after death rewards and punishments fall with lighter
weight! whereas, if any judgment awaits souls at all, it ought rather to be supposed that it
will be heavier at the conclusion of life than in the conduct1724 thereof, since nothing is
more complete than that which comes at the very last—nothing, moreover, is more complete
than that which is especially divine. Accordingly, God’s judgment will be more full and
complete, because it will be pronounced at the very last, in an eternal irrevocable sentence,
both of punishment and of consolation, (on men whose) souls are not to transmigrate into
beasts, but are to return into their own proper bodies. And all this once for all, and on “that
day, too, of which the Father only knoweth;”1725 (only knoweth,) in order that by her
trembling expectation faith may make full trial of her anxious sincerity, keeping her gaze
ever fixed on that day, in her perpetual ignorance of it, daily fearing that for which she yet

<head>Chapter XXXIV.—These Vagaries Stimulated Some Profane Corruptions of Christianity. The Profanity of Simon Magus Condemned.</head>
<p>No tenet, indeed, under cover of any heresy has as yet burst upon us, embodying any
such extravagant fiction as that the souls of human beings pass into the bodies of wild beasts;
but yet we have deemed it necessary to attack and refute this conceit, as a consistent sequel
to the preceding opinions, in order that Homer in the peacock might be got rid of as effectually
as Pythagoras in Euphorbus; and in order that, by the demolition of the metempsychosis
and metensomatosis by the same blow, the ground might be cut away which has furnished
no inconsiderable support to our heretics. There is the (infamous) Simon of Samaria
in the Acts of the Apostles, who chaffered for the Holy Ghost: after his condemnation by
Him, and a vain remorse that he and his money must perish together,1726 he applied his
energies to the destruction of the truth, as if to console himself with revenge. Besides the
support with which his own magic arts furnished him, he had recourse to imposture, and
purchased a Tyrian woman of the name of Helen out of a brothel, with the same money
which he had offered for the Holy Spirit,—a traffic worthy of the wretched man. He actually
feigned himself to be the Supreme Father, and further pretended that the woman was his
own primary conception, wherewith he had purposed the creation of the angels and the
archangels; that after she was possessed of this purpose she sprang forth from the Father
and descended to the lower spaces, and there anticipating the Father’s design had produced
the angelic powers, which knew nothing of the Father, the Creator of this world; that she
was detained a prisoner by these from a (rebellious) motive very like her own, lest after her
departure from them they should appear to be the offspring of another being; and that, after
being on this account exposed to every insult, to prevent her leaving them anywhere after
her dishonour, she was degraded even to the form of man, to be confined, as it were, in the
bonds of the flesh. Having during many ages wallowed about in one female shape and another,
she became the notorious Helen who was so ruinous to Priam, and afterwards to the
eyes of Stesichorus, whom, she blinded in revenge for his lampoons, and then restored to
sight to reward him for his eulogies. After wandering about in this way from body to body,
she, in her final disgrace, turned out a viler Helen still as a professional prostitute. This
wench, therefore, was the lost sheep, upon whom the Supreme Father, even Simon, descended,
who, after he had recovered her and brought her back—whether on his shoulders or
loins I cannot tell—cast an eye on the salvation of man, in order to gratify his spleen by
liberating them from the angelic powers. Moreover, to deceive these he also himself assumed
a visible shape; and feigning the appearance of a man amongst men, he acted the part of the
Son in Judea, and of the Father in Samaria. O hapless Helen, what a hard fate is yours between
the poets and the heretics, who have blackened your fame sometimes with adultery, some-

to be so tardy in seeking her out, and so inconstant in ransoming her! How different from
Menelaus! As soon as he has lost her, he goes in pursuit of her; she is no sooner ravished
than he begins his search; after a ten years’ conflict he boldly rescues her: there is no lurking,
no deceiving, no cavilling. I am really afraid that he was a much better “Father,” who laboured
so much more vigilantly, bravely, and perseveringly, about the recovery of his Helen.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXV.—The Opinions of Carpocrates, Another Offset from the Pythagorean
Dogmas, Stated and Confuted.</head>
<p>However, it is not for you alone, (Simon), that the transmigration philosophy has fabricated
this story. Carpocrates also makes equally good use of it, who was a magician and a
fornicator like yourself, only he had not a Helen.1727 And why should he not? since he asserted
that souls are reinvested with bodies, in order to ensure the overthrow by all means
of divine and human truth. For, (according to his miserable doctrine,) this life became
consummated to no man until all those blemishes which are held to disfigure it have been
fully displayed in its conduct; because there is nothing which is accounted evil by nature,
but simply as men think of it. The transmigration of human souls, therefore, into any kind
of heterogeneous bodies, he thought by all means indispensable, whenever any depravity
whatever had not been fully perpetrated in the early stage of life’s passage. Evil deeds (one
may be sure) appertain to life. Moreover, as often as the soul has fallen short as a defaulter
in sin, it has to be recalled to existence, until it “pays the utmost farthing,”1728 thrust out
from time to time into the prison of the body. To this effect does he tamper with the whole
of that allegory of the Lord which is extremely clear and simple in its meaning, and ought
to be from the first understood in its plain and natural sense. Thus our “adversary” (therein
mentioned1729) is the heathen man, who is walking with us along the same road of life which
is common to him and ourselves. Now “we must needs go out of the world,”1730 if it be not
allowed us to have conversation with them. He bids us, therefore, show a kindly disposition
to such a man. “Love your enemies,” says He, “pray for them that curse you,”1731 lest such
a man in any transaction of business be irritated by any unjust conduct of yours, and “deliver
thee to the judge” of his own (nation1732), and you be thrown into prison, and be detained
in its close and narrow cell until you have liquidated all your debt against him.1733 Then,
again, should you be disposed to apply the term “adversary” to the devil, you are advised
by the (Lord’s) injunction, “while you are in the way with him,” to make even with him such
a compact as may be deemed compatible with the requirements of your true faith. Now the
compact you have made respecting him is to renounce him, and his pomp, and his angels.
Such is your agreement in this matter. Now the friendly understanding you will have to

carry out must arise from your observance of the compact: you must never think of getting
back any of the things which you have abjured, and have restored to him, lest he should
summon you as a fraudulent man, and a transgressor of your agreement, before God the
Judge (for in this light do we read of him, in another passage, as “the accuser of the
brethren,”1734 or saints, where reference is made to the actual practice of legal prosecution);
and lest this Judge deliver you over to the angel who is to execute the sentence, and he
commit you to the prison of hell, out of which there will be no dismissal until the smallest
even of your delinquencies be paid off in the period before the resurrection.1735 What can
be a more fitting sense than this? What a truer interpretation? If, however, according to
Carpocrates, the soul is bound to the commission of all sorts of crime and evil conduct,
what must we from his system understand to be its “adversary” and foe? I suppose it must
be that better mind which shall compel it by force to the performance of some act of virtue,
that it may be driven from body to body, until it be found in none a debtor to the claims of
a virtuous life. This means, that a good tree is known by its bad fruit—in other words, that
the doctrine of truth is understood from the worst possible precepts. I apprehend1736 that
heretics of this school seize with especial avidity the example of Elias, whom they assume
to have been so reproduced in John (the Baptist) as to make our Lord’s statement sponsor
for their theory of transmigration, when He said, “Elias is come already, and they knew him
not;”1737 and again, in another passage, “And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for
to come.”1738 Well, then, was it really in a Pythagorean sense that the Jews approached John
with the inquiry, “Art thou Elias?”1739 and not rather in the sense of the divine prediction,
“Behold, I will send you Elijah” the Tisbite?1740 The fact, however, is, that their metempsychosis,
or transmigration theory, signifies the recall of the soul which had died long before,
and its return to some other body. But Elias is to come again, not after quitting life (in the
way of dying), but after his translation (or removal without dying); not for the purpose of
being restored to the body, from which he had not departed, but for the purpose of revisiting
the world from which he was translated; not by way of resuming a life which he had laid
aside, but of fulfilling prophecy,—really and truly the same man, both in respect of his name
and designation, as well as of his unchanged humanity. How, therefore could John be Elias?

You have your answer in the angel’s announcement: “And he shall go before the people,”
says he, “in the spirit and power of Elias”—not (observe) in his soul and his body. These
substances are, in fact, the natural property of each individual; whilst “the spirit and power”
are bestowed as external gifts by the grace of God and so may be transferred to another
person according to the purpose and will of the Almighty, as was anciently the case with
respect to the spirit of Moses.1741</p>

<head>Chapter XXXVI.—The Main Points of Our Author’s Subject. On the Sexes of the
Human Race.</head>
<p>For the discussion of these questions we abandoned, if I remember rightly, ground to
which we must now return. We had established the position that the soul is seminally placed
in man, and by human agency, and that its seed from the very beginning is uniform, as is
that of the soul also, to the race of man; (and this we settled) owing to the rival opinions of
the philosophers and the heretics, and that ancient saying mentioned by Plato (to which we
referred above).1742 We now pursue in their order the points which follow from them. The
soul, being sown in the womb at the same time as the body, receives likewise along with it
its sex; and this indeed so simultaneously, that neither of the two substances can be alone
regarded as the cause of the sex. Now, if in the semination of these substances any interval
were admissible in their conception, in such wise that either the flesh or the soul should be
the first to be conceived, one might then ascribe an especial sex to one of the substances,
owing to the difference in the time of the impregnations, so that either the flesh would impress
its sex upon the soul, or the soul upon the sex; even as Apelles (the heretic, not the
painter1743) gives the priority over their bodies to the souls of men and women, as he had
been taught by Philumena, and in consequence makes the flesh, as the later, receive its sex
from the soul. They also who make the soul supervene after birth on the flesh predetermine,
of course, the sex of the previously formed soul to be male or female, according to (the sex
of) the flesh. But the truth is, the seminations of the two substances are inseparable in point
of time, and their effusion is also one and the same, in consequence of which a community
of gender is secured to them; so that the course of nature, whatever that be, shall draw the
line (for the distinct sexes). Certainly in this view we have an attestation of the method of
the first two formations, when the male was moulded and tempered in a completer way, for
Adam was first formed; and the woman came far behind him, for Eve was the later formed.
So that her flesh was for a long time without specific form (such as she afterwards assumed
when taken out of Adam’s side); but she was even then herself a living being, because I
should regard her at that time in soul as even a portion of Adam. Besides, God’s afflatus
would have animated her too, if there had not been in the woman a transmission from Adam
of his soul also as well as of his flesh.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXVII.—On the Formation and State of the Embryo. Its Relation with
the Subject of This Treatise.</head>
<p>Now the entire process of sowing, forming, and completing the human embryo in the
womb is no doubt regulated by some power, which ministers herein to the will of God,
whatever may be the method which it is appointed to employ. Even the superstition of
Rome, by carefully attending to these points, imagined the goddess Alemona to nourish the
foetus in the womb; as well as (the goddesses) Nona and Decima, called after the most critical
months of gestation; and Partula, to manage and direct parturition; and Lucina, to bring
the child to the birth and light of day. We, on our part, believe the angels to officiate herein
for God. The embryo therefore becomes a human being in the womb from the moment that
its form is completed. The law of Moses, indeed, punishes with due penalties the man who
shall cause abortion, inasmuch as there exists already the rudiment of a human being,1744
which has imputed to it even now the condition of life and death, since it is already liable
to the issues of both, although, by living still in the mother, it for the most part shares its
own state with the mother. I must also say something about the period of the soul’s birth,
that I may omit nothing incidental in the whole process. A mature and regular birth takes
place, as a general rule, at the commencement of the tenth month. They who theorize respecting
numbers, honour the number ten as the parent of all the others, and as imparting
perfection to the human nativity. For my own part, I prefer viewing this measure of time
in reference to God, as if implying that the ten months rather initiated man into the ten
commandments; so that the numerical estimate of the time needed to consummate our
natural birth should correspond to the numerical classification of the rules of our regenerate
life. But inasmuch as birth is also completed with the seventh month, I more readily recognize
in this number than in the eighth the honour of a numerical agreement with the sabbatical
period; so that the month in which God’s image is sometimes produced in a human birth,
shall in its number tally with the day on which God’s creation was completed and hallowed.
Human nativity has sometimes been allowed to be premature, and yet to occur in fit and
perfect accordance with an hebdomad or sevenfold number, as an auspice of our resurrection,
and rest, and kingdom. The ogdoad, or eightfold number, therefore, is not concerned in our
formation;1745 for in the time it represents there will be no more marriage.1746 We have
already demonstrated the conjunction of the body and the soul, from the concretion of their
very seminations to the complete formation of the foetus. We now maintain their conjunction
likewise from the birth onwards; in the first place, because they both grow together, only
each in a different manner suited to the diversity of their nature—the flesh in magnitude,

the soul in intelligence—the flesh in material condition, the soul in sensibility. We are,
however, forbidden to suppose that the soul increases in substance, lest it should be said
also to be capable of diminution in substance, and so its extinction even should be believed
to be possible; but its inherent power, in which are contained all its natural peculiarities, as
originally implanted in its being, is gradually developed along with the flesh, without impairing
the germinal basis of the substance, which it received when breathed at first into man.
Take a certain quantity of gold or of silver—a rough mass as yet: it has indeed a compact
condition, and one that is more compressed at the moment than it will be; yet it contains
within its contour what is throughout a mass of gold or of silver. When this mass is afterwards
extended by beating it into leaf, it becomes larger than it was before by the elongation of
the original mass, but not by any addition thereto, because it is extended in space, not increased
in bulk; although in a way it is even increased when it is extended: for it may be increased
in form, but not in state. Then, again, the sheen of the gold or the silver, which
when the metal was any in block was inherent in it no doubt really, but yet only obscurely,
shines out in developed lustre. Afterwards various modifications of shape accrue, according
to the feasibility in the material which makes it yield to the manipulation of the artisan, who
yet adds nothing to the condition of the mass but its configuration. In like manner, the
growth and developments of the soul are to be estimated, not as enlarging its substance, but
as calling forth its powers.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXVIII.—On the Growth of the Soul. Its Maturity Coincident with the
Maturity of the Flesh in Man.</head>
<p>Now we have already1747 laid down the principle, that all the natural properties of the
soul which relate to sense and intelligence are inherent in its very substance, and spring
from its native constitution, but that they advance by a gradual growth through the stages
of life and develope themselves in different ways by accidental circumstances, according to
men’s means and arts, their manners and customs their local situations, and the influences
of the Supreme Powers;1748 but in pursuance of that aspect of the association of body and
soul which we have now to consider, we maintain that the puberty of the soul coincides with
that of the body, and that they attain both together to this full growth at about the fourteenth
year of life, speaking generally,—the former by the suggestion of the senses, and the latter
by the growth of the bodily members; and (we fix on this age) not because, as Asclepiades
supposes, reflection then begins, nor because the civil laws date the commencement of the
real business of life from this period, but because this was the appointed order from the very
first. For as Adam and Eve felt that they must cover their nakedness after their knowledge
of good and evil so we profess to have the same discernment of good and evil from the time
that we experience the same sensation of shame. Now from the before-mentioned age (of
fourteen years) sex is suffused and clothed with an especial sensibility, and concupiscence
employs the ministry of the eye, and communicates its pleasure to another, and understands
the natural relations between male and female, and wears the fig-tree apron to cover the
shame which it still excites, and drives man out of the paradise of innocence and chastity,
and in its wild pruriency falls upon sins and unnatural incentives to delinquency; for its
impulse has by this time surpassed the appointment of nature, and springs from its vicious
abuse. But the strictly natural concupiscence is simply confined to the desire of those aliments
which God at the beginning conferred upon man. “Of every tree of the garden” He says, “ye
shall freely eat;”1749 and then again to the generation which followed next after the flood
He enlarged the grant: “Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; behold, as the
green herb have I given you all these things,”1750—where He has regard rather to the body
than to the soul, although it be in the interest of the soul also. For we must remove all occasion
from the caviller, who, because the soul apparently wants ailments, would insist on the soul’s
being from this circumstance deemed mortal, since it is sustained by meat and drink and
after a time loses its rigour when they are withheld, and on their complete removal ultimately
droops and dies. Now the point we must keep in view is not merely which particular faculty

<pb n="460"/>
it is which desires these (aliments), but also for what end; and even if it be for its own sake,
still the question remains, Why this desire, and when felt, and how long? Then again there
is the consideration, that it is one thing to desire by natural instinct, and another thing to
desire through necessity; one thing to desire as a property of being, another thing to desire
for a special object. The soul, therefore, will desire meat and drink—for itself indeed, because
of a special necessity; for the flesh, however, from the nature of its properties. For the flesh
is no doubt the house of the soul, and the soul is the temporary inhabitant of the flesh. The
desire, then, of the lodger will arise from the temporary cause and the special necessity which
his very designation suggests,—with a view to benefit and improve the place of his temporary
abode, while sojourning in it; not with the view, certainly, of being himself the foundation
of the house, or himself its walls, or himself its support and roof, but simply and solely with
the view of being accommodated and housed, since he could not receive such accommodation
except in a sound and well-built house. (Now, applying this imagery to the soul,) if it be not
provided with this accommodation, it will not be in its power to quit its dwelling-place, and
for want of fit and proper resources, to depart safe and sound, in possession, too, of its own
supports, and the aliments which belong to its own proper condition,—namely immortality,
rationality, sensibility, intelligence, and freedom of the will.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIX.—The Evil Spirit Has Marred the Purity of the Soul from the Very
Birth.</head>
<p>All these endowments of the soul which are bestowed on it at birth are still obscured
and depraved by the malignant being who, in the beginning, regarded them with envious
eye, so that they are never seen in their spontaneous action, nor are they administered as
they ought to be. For to what individual of the human race will not the evil spirit cleave,
ready to entrap their souls from the very portal of their birth, at which he is invited to be
present in all those superstitious processes which accompany childbearing? Thus it comes
to pass that all men are brought to the birth with idolatry for the midwife, whilst the very
wombs that bear them, still bound with the fillets that have been wreathed before the idols,
declare their offspring to be consecrated to demons: for in parturition they invoke the aid
of Lucina and Diana; for a whole week a table is spread in honour of Juno; on the last day
the fates of the horoscope1751 are invoked; and then the infant’s first step on the ground is
sacred to the goddess Statina. After this does any one fail to devote to idolatrous service the
entire head of his son, or to take out a hair, or to shave off the whole with a razor, or to bind
it up for an offering, or seal it for sacred use—in behalf of the clan, of the ancestry, or for
public devotion? On this principle of early possession it was that Socrates, while yet a boy,
was found by the spirit of the demon. Thus, too, is it that to all persons their genii are assigned,
which is only another name for demons. Hence in no case (I mean of the heathen,
of course) is there any nativity which is pure of idolatrous superstition. It was from this
circumstance that the apostle said, that when either of the parents was sanctified, the children
were holy;1752 and this as much by the prerogative of the (Christian) seed as by the discipline
of the institution (by baptism, and Christian education). “Else,” says he, “were the children
unclean” by birth:1753 as if he meant us to understand that the children of believers were
designed for holiness, and thereby for salvation; in order that he might by the pledge of such
a hope give his support to matrimony, which he had determined to maintain in its integrity.
Besides, he had certainly not forgotten what the Lord had so definitively stated: “Except a
man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God;”1754 in
other words, he cannot be holy.</p>

<head>Chapter XL.—The Body of Man Only Ancillary to the Soul in the Commission of
Evil.</head>
<p>Every soul, then, by reason of its birth, has its nature in Adam until it is born again in
Christ; moreover, it is unclean all the while that it remains without this regeneration;1755
and because unclean, it is actively sinful, and suffuses even the flesh (by reason of their
conjunction) with its own shame. Now although the flesh is sinful, and we are forbidden to
walk in accordance with it,1756 and its works are condemned as lusting against the spirit,1757
and men on its account are censured as carnal,1758 yet the flesh has not such ignominy on
its own account. For it is not of itself that it thinks anything or feels anything for the purpose
of advising or commanding sin. How should it, indeed? It is only a ministering thing, and
its ministration is not like that of a servant or familiar friend—animated and human beings;
but rather that of a vessel, or something of that kind: it is body, not soul. Now a cup may
minister to a thirsty man; and yet, if the thirsty man will not apply the cup to his mouth,
the cup will yield no ministering service. Therefore the differentia, or distinguishing property,
of man by no means lies in his earthy element; nor is the flesh the human person, as being
some faculty of his soul, and a personal quality; but it is a thing of quite a different substance
and different condition, although annexed to the soul as a chattel or as an instrument for
the offices of life. Accordingly the flesh is blamed in the Scriptures, because nothing is done
by the soul without the flesh in operations of concupiscence, appetite, drunkenness, cruelty,
idolatry, and other works of the flesh,—operations, I mean, which are not confined to sensations,
but result in effects. The emotions of sin, indeed, when not resulting in effects, are
usually imputed to the soul: “Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after, hath already in
his heart committed adultery with her.”1759 But what has the flesh alone, without the soul,
ever done in operations of virtue, righteousness, endurance, or chastity? What absurdity,
however, it is to attribute sin and crime to that substance to which you do not assign any
good actions or character of its own! Now the party which aids in the commission of a
crime is brought to trial, only in such a way that the principal offender who actually committed
the crime may bear the weight of the penalty, although the abettor too does not escape
indictment. Greater is the odium which falls on the principal, when his officials are punished
through his fault. He is beaten with more stripes who instigates and orders the crime, whilst
at the same time he who obeys such an evil command is not acquitted.</p>

<head>Chapter XLI.—Notwithstanding the Depravity of Man’s Soul by Original Sin, There is Yet Left a Basis Whereon Divine Grace Can Work for Its Recovery by Spiritual  Regeneration.</head>
<p>There is, then, besides the evil which supervenes on the soul from the intervention of
the evil spirit, an antecedent, and in a certain sense natural, evil which arises from its corrupt
origin. For, as we have said before, the corruption of our nature is another nature having a
god and father of its own, namely the author of (that) corruption. Still there is a portion of
good in the soul, of that original, divine, and genuine good, which is its proper nature. For
that which is derived from God is rather obscured than extinguished. It can be obscured,
indeed, because it is not God; extinguished, however, it cannot be, because it comes from
God. As therefore light, when intercepted by an opaque body, still remains, although it is
not apparent, by reason of the interposition of so dense a body; so likewise the good in the
soul, being weighed down by the evil, is, owing to the obscuring character thereof, either
not seen at all, its light being wholly hidden, or else only a stray beam is there visible where
it struggles through by an accidental outlet. Thus some men are very bad, and some very
good; but yet the souls of all form but one genus: even in the worst there is something good,
and in the best there is something bad. For God alone is without sin; and the only man
without sin is Christ, since Christ is also God. Thus the divinity of the soul bursts forth in
prophetic forecasts in consequence of its primeval good; and being conscious of its origin,
it bears testimony to God (its author) in exclamations such as: Good God! God knows! and
Good-bye!1760 Just as no soul is without sin, so neither is any soul without seeds of good.
Therefore, when the soul embraces the faith, being renewed in its second birth by water and
the power from above, then the veil of its former corruption being taken away, it beholds
the light in all its brightness. It is also taken up (in its second birth) by the Holy Spirit, just
as in its first birth it is embraced by the unholy spirit. The flesh follows the soul now wedded
to the Spirit, as a part of the bridal portion—no longer the servant of the soul, but of the
Spirit. O happy marriage, if in it there is committed no violation of the nuptial vow!</p>

<head>Chapter XLII.—Sleep, the Mirror of Death, as Introductory to the Consideration of
Death.</head>
<p>It now remains (that we discuss the subject) of death, in order that our subject-matter
may terminate where the soul itself completes it; although Epicurus, indeed, in his pretty
widely known doctrine, has asserted that death does not appertain to us. That, says he, which
is dissolved lacks sensation; and that which is without sensation is nothing to us. Well, but
it is not actually death which suffers dissolution and lacks sensation, but the human person
who experiences death. Yet even he has admitted suffering to be incidental to the being to
whom action belongs. Now, if it is in man to suffer death, which dissolves the body and
destroys the senses, how absurd to say that so great a susceptibility belongs not to man!
With much greater precision does Seneca say: “After death all comes to an end, even (death)
itself.” From which position of his it must needs follow that death will appertain to its own
self, since itself comes to an end; and much more to man, in the ending of whom amongst
the “all,” itself also ends. Death, (says Epicurus) belongs not to us; then at that rate, life belongs
not to us. For certainly, if that which causes our dissolution have no relation to us,
that also which compacts and composes us must be unconnected with us. If the deprivation
of our sensation be nothing to us, neither can the acquisition of sensation have anything to
do with us. The fact, however, is, he who destroys the very soul, (as Epicurus does), cannot
help destroying death also. As for ourselves, indeed, (Christians as we are), we must treat
of death just as we should of the posthumous life and of some other province of the soul,
(assuming) that we at all events belong to death, if it does not pertain to us. And on the same
principle, even sleep, which is the very mirror of death, is not alien from our subject-matter.</p>

<pb n="465"/>
<head>Chapter XLIII.—Sleep a Natural Function as Shown by Other Considerations, and
by the Testimony of Scripture.</head>
<p>Let us therefore first discuss the question of sleep, and afterwards in what way the soul
encounters1761 death. Now sleep is certainly not a supernatural thing, as some philosophers
will have it be, when they suppose it to be the result of causes which appear to be above
nature. The Stoics affirm sleep to be “a temporary suspension of the activity of the senses;”1762
the Epicureans define it as an intermission of the animal spirit; Anaxagoras and Xenophanes
as a weariness of the same; Empedocles and Parmenides as a cooling down thereof; Strato
as a separation of the (soul’s) connatural spirit; Democritus as the soul’s indigence; Aristotle
as the interruption1763 of the heat around the heart. As for myself, I can safely say that I
have never slept in such a way as to discover even a single one of these conditions. Indeed,
we cannot possibly believe that sleep is a weariness; it is rather the opposite, for it undoubtedly
removes weariness, and a person is refreshed by sleep instead of being fatigued. Besides,
sleep is not always the result of fatigue; and even when it is, the fatigue continues no longer.
Nor can I allow that sleep is a cooling or decaying of the animal heat, for our bodies derive
warmth from sleep in such a way that the regular dispersion of the food by means of sleep
could not so easily go on if there were too much heat to accelerate it unduly, or cold to retard
it, if sleep had the alleged refrigerating influence. There is also the further fact that perspiration
indicates an over-heated digestion; and digestion is predicated of us as a process of
concoction, which is an operation concerned with heat and not with cold. In like manner,
the immortality of the soul precludes belief in the theory that sleep is an intermission of the
animal spirit, or an indigence of the spirit, or a separation of the (soul’s) connatural spirit.
The soul perishes if it undergoes diminution or intermission. Our only resource, indeed, is
to agree with the Stoics, by determining the soul to be a temporary suspension of the activity
of the senses, procuring rest for the body only, not for the soul also. For the soul, as being
always in motion, and always active, never succumbs to rest,—a condition which is alien to
immortality: for nothing immortal admits any end to its operation; but sleep is an end of
operation. It is indeed on the body, which is subject to mortality, and on the body alone,
that sleep graciously bestows1764 a cessation from work. He, therefore, who shall doubt
whether sleep is a natural function, has the dialectical experts calling in question the whole
difference between things natural and supernatural—so that what things he supposed to be
beyond nature he may, (if he likes,) be safe in assigning to nature, which indeed has made
such a disposition of things, that they may seemingly be accounted as beyond it; and so, of

<pb n="466"/>
course, all things are natural or none are natural, (as occasion requires.) With us (Christians),
however, only that can receive a hearing which is suggested by contemplating God, the
Author of all the things which we are now discussing. For we believe that nature, if it is
anything, is a reasonable work of God. Now reason presides over sleep; for sleep is so fit
for man, so useful, so necessary, that were it not for it, not a soul could provide agency for
recruiting the body, for restoring its energies, for ensuring its health, for supplying suspension
from work and remedy against labour, and for the legitimate enjoyment of which day departs,
and night provides an ordinance by taking from all objects their very colour. Since, then,
sleep is indispensable to our life, and health, and succour, there can be nothing pertaining
to it which is not reasonable, and which is not natural. Hence it is that physicians banish
beyond the gateway of nature everything which is contrary to what is vital, healthful, and
helpful to nature; for those maladies which are inimical to sleep—maladies of the mind and
of the stomach—they have decided to be contrariant to nature, and by such decision have
determined as its corollary that sleep is perfectly natural. Moreover, when they declare that
sleep is not natural in the lethargic state, they derive their conclusion from the fact that it
is natural when it is in its due and regular exercise. For every natural state is impaired either
by defect or by excess, whilst it is maintained by its proper measure and amount. That,
therefore, will be natural in its condition which may be rendered non-natural by defect or
by excess. Well, now, what if you were to remove eating and drinking from the conditions
of nature? if in them lies the chief incentive to sleep. It is certain that, from the very beginning
of his nature, man was impressed with these instincts (of sleep).1765 If you receive your instruction
from God, (you will find) that the fountain of the human race, Adam, had a taste
of drowsiness before having a draught of repose; slept before he laboured, or even before
he ate, nay, even before he spoke; in order that men may see that sleep is a natural feature
and function, and one which has actually precedence over all the natural faculties. From
this primary instance also we are led to trace even then the image of death in sleep. For as
Adam was a figure of Christ, Adam’s sleep shadowed out the death of Christ, who was to
sleep a mortal slumber, that from the wound inflicted on His side might, in like manner (as
Eve was formed), be typified the church, the true mother of the living. This is why sleep is
so salutary, so rational, and is actually formed into the model of that death which is general
and common to the race of man. God, indeed, has willed (and it may be said in passing that
He has, generally, in His dispensations brought nothing to pass without such types and
shadows) to set before us, in a manner more fully and completely than Plato’s example, by
daily recurrence the outlines of man’s state, especially concerning the beginning and the
termination thereof; thus stretching out the hand to help our faith more readily by types
and parables, not in words only, but also in things. He accordingly sets before your view

the human body stricken by the friendly power of slumber, prostrated by the kindly necessity
of repose immoveable in position, just as it lay previous to life, and just as it will lie after life
is past: there it lies as an attestation of its form when first moulded, and of its condition
when at last buried—awaiting the soul in both stages, in the former previous to its bestowal,
in the latter after its recent withdrawal. Meanwhile the soul is circumstanced in such a
manner as to seem to be elsewhere active, learning to bear future absence by a dissembling
of its presence for the moment. We shall soon know the case of Hermotimus. But yet it
dreams in the interval. Whence then its dreams? The fact is, it cannot rest or be idle altogether,
nor does it confine to the still hours of sleep the nature of its immortality. It proves itself
to possess a constant motion; it travels over land and sea, it trades, it is excited, it labours,
it plays, it grieves, it rejoices, it follows pursuits lawful and unlawful; it shows what very
great power it has even without the body, how well equipped it is with members of its own,
although betraying at the same time the need it has of impressing on some body its activity
again. Accordingly, when the body shakes off its slumber, it asserts before your eye the resurrection
of the dead by its own resumption of its natural functions. Such, therefore, must
be both the natural reason and the reasonable nature of sleep. If you only regard it as the
image of death, you initiate faith, you nourish hope, you learn both how to die and how to
live, you learn watchfulness, even while you sleep.</p>

<head>Chapter XLIV.—The Story of Hermotimus, and the Sleeplessness of the Emperor
Nero. No Separation of the Soul from the Body Until Death.</head>
<p>With regard to the case of Hermotimus, they say that he used to be deprived of his soul
in his sleep, as if it wandered away from his body like a person on a holiday trip. His wife
betrayed the strange peculiarity. His enemies, finding him asleep, burnt his body, as if it
were a corpse: when his soul returned too late, it appropriated (I suppose) to itself the guilt
of the murder. However the good citizens of Clazomenæ consoled poor Hermotimus with
a temple, into which no woman ever enters, because of the infamy of this wife. Now why
this story? In order that, since the vulgar belief so readily holds sleep to be the separation
of the soul from the body, credulity should not be encouraged by this case of Hermotimus.
It must certainly have been a much heavier sort of slumber: one would presume it was the
nightmare, or perhaps that diseased languor which Soranus suggests in opposition to the
nightmare, or else some such malady as that which the fable has fastened upon Epimenides,
who slept on some fifty years or so. Suetonius, however, informs us that Nero never dreamt,
and Theopompus says the same thing about Thrasymedes; but Nero at the close of his life
did with some difficulty dream after some excessive alarm. What indeed would be said, if
the case of Hermotimus were believed to be such that the repose of his soul was a state of
actual idleness during sleep, and a positive separation from his body? You may conjecture
it to be anything but such a licence of the soul as admits of flights away from the body
without death, and that by continual recurrence, as if habitual to its state and constitution.
If indeed such a thing were told me to have happened at any time to the soul—resembling
a total eclipse of the sun or the moon—I should verily suppose that the occurrence had been
caused by God’s own interposition, for it would not be unreasonable for a man to receive
admonition from the Divine Being either in the way of warning or of alarm, as by a flash of
lightning, or by a sudden stroke of death; only it would be much the more natural conclusion
to believe that this process should be by a dream, because if it must be supposed to be, (as
the hypothesis we are resisting assumes it to be,) not a dream, the occurrence ought rather
to happen to a man whilst he is wide awake.</p>

<head>Chapter XLV.—Dreams, an Incidental Effect of the Soul’s Activity. Ecstasy.</head>
<p>We are bound to expound at this point what is the opinion of Christians respecting
dreams, as incidents of sleep, and as no slight or trifling excitements of the soul, which we
have declared to be always occupied and active owing to its perpetual movement, which
again is a proof and evidence of its divine quality and immortality. When, therefore, rest
accrues to human bodies, it being their own especial comfort, the soul, disdaining a repose
which is not natural to it, never rests; and since it receives no help from the limbs of the
body, it uses its own. Imagine a gladiator without his instruments or arms, and a charioteer
without his team, but still gesticulating the entire course and exertion of their respective
employments: there is the fight, there is the struggle; but the effort is a vain one. Nevertheless
the whole procedure seems to be gone through, although it evidently has not been really
effected. There is the act, but not the effect. This power we call ecstasy, in which the sensuous
soul stands out of itself, in a way which even resembles madness.1766 Thus in the very beginning
sleep was inaugurated by ecstasy: “And God sent an ecstasy upon Adam, and he
slept.”1767 The sleep came on his body to cause it to rest, but the ecstasy fell on his soul to
remove rest: from that very circumstance it still happens ordinarily (and from the order
results the nature of the case) that sleep is combined with ecstasy. In fact, with what real
feeling, and anxiety, and suffering do we experience joy, and sorrow, and alarm in our
dreams! Whereas we should not be moved by any such emotions, by what would be the
merest fantasies of course, if when we dream we were masters of ourselves, (unaffected by
ecstasy.) In these dreams, indeed, good actions are useless, and crimes harmless; for we shall
no more be condemned for visionary acts of sin, than we shall be crowned for imaginary
martyrdom. But how, you will ask, can the soul remember its dreams, when it is said to be
without any mastery over its own operations? This memory must be an especial gift of the
ecstatic condition of which we are treating, since it arises not from any failure of healthy
action, but entirely from natural process; nor does it expel mental function—it withdraws
it for a time. It is one thing to shake, it is another thing to move; one thing to destroy, another
thing to agitate. That, therefore, which memory supplies betokens soundness of mind; and
that which a sound mind ecstatically experiences whilst the memory remains unchecked,
is a kind of madness. We are accordingly not said to be mad, but to dream, in that state; to
be in the full possession also of our mental faculties,1768 if we are at any time. For although
the power to exercise these faculties1769 may be dimmed in us, it is still not extinguished;
except that it may seem to be itself absent at the very time that the ecstasy is energizing in

<head>Chapter XLVI.—Diversity of Dreams and Visions. Epicurus Thought Lightly of
Them, Though Generally Most Highly Valued. Instances of Dreams.</head>
<p>We now find ourselves constrained to express an opinion about the character of the
dreams by which the soul is excited. And when shall we arrive at the subject of death? And
on such a question I would say, When God shall permit: that admits of no long delay which
must needs happen at all events. Epicurus has given it as his opinion that dreams are altogether
vain things; (but he says this) when liberating the Deity from all sort of care, and
dissolving the entire order of the world, and giving to all things the aspect of merest chance,
casual in their issues, fortuitous in their nature. Well, now, if such be the nature of things,
there must be some chance even for truth, because it is impossible for it to be the only thing
to be exempted from the fortune which is due to all things. Homer has assigned two gates
to dreams,1770—the horny one of truth, the ivory one of error and delusion. For, they say,
it is possible to see through horn, whereas ivory is untransparent. Aristotle, while expressing
his opinion that dreams are in most cases untrue, yet acknowledges that there is some truth
in them. The people of Telmessus will not admit that dreams are in any case unmeaning,
but they blame their own weakness when unable to conjecture their signification. Now, who
is such a stranger to human experience as not sometimes to have perceived some truth in
dreams? I shall force a blush from Epicurus, if I only glance at some few of the more remarkable
instances. Herodotus1771 relates how that Astyages, king of the Medes, saw in a dream
issuing from the womb of his virgin daughter a flood which inundated Asia; and again, in
the year which followed her marriage, he saw a vine growing out from the same part of her
person, which overspread the whole of Asia. The same story is told prior to Herodotus by
Charon of Lampsacus. Now they who interpreted these visions did not deceive the mother
when they destined her son for so great an enterprise, for Cyrus both inundated and overspread
Asia. Philip of Macedon, before he became a father, had seen imprinted on the
pudenda of his consort Olympias the form of a small ring, with a lion as a seal. He had
concluded that an offspring from her was out of the question (I suppose because the lion
only becomes once a father), when Aristodemus or Aristophon happened to conjecture that
nothing of an unmeaning or empty import lay under that seal, but that a son of very illustrious
character was portended. They who know anything of Alexander recognise in him the
lion of that small ring. Ephorus writes to this effect. Again, Heraclides has told us, that a
certain woman of Himera beheld in a dream Dionysius’ tyranny over Sicily. Euphorion has
publicly recorded as a fact, that, previous to giving birth to Seleucus, his mother Laodice
foresaw that he was destined for the empire of Asia. I find again from Strabo, that it was
owing to a dream that even Mithridates took possession of Pontus; and I further learn from

<pb n="472"/>
Callisthenes that it was from the indication of a dream that Baraliris the Illyrian stretched
his dominion from the Molossi to the frontiers of Macedon. The Romans, too, were acquainted
with dreams of this kind. From a dream Marcus Tullius (Cicero) had learnt how that
one, who was yet only a little boy, and in a private station, who was also plain Julius
Octavius, and personally unknown to (Cicero) himself, was the destined Augustus, and the
suppressor and destroyer of (Rome’s) civil discords. This is recorded in the Commentaries
of Vitellius. But visions of this prophetic kind were not confined to predictions of supreme
power; for they indicated perils also, and catastrophes: as, for instance, when Cæsar was
absent from the battle of Philippi through illness, and thereby escaped the sword of Brutus
and Cassius, and then although he expected to encounter greater danger still from the enemy
in the field, he quitted his tent for it, in obedience to a vision of Artorius, and so escaped
(the capture by the enemy, who shortly after took possession of the tent); as, again, when
the daughter of Polycrates of Samos foresaw the crucifixion which awaited him from the
anointing of the sun and the bath of Jupiter.1772 So likewise in sleep revelations are made
of high honours and eminent talents; remedies are also discovered, thefts brought to light,
and treasures indicated. Thus Cicero’s eminence, whilst he was still a little boy, was foreseen
by his nurse. The swan from the breast of Socrates soothing men, is his disciple Plato. The
boxer Leonymus is cured by Achilles in his dreams. Sophocles the tragic poet discovers, as
he was dreaming, the golden crown, which had been lost from the citadel of Athens. Neoptolemus
the tragic actor, through intimations in his sleep from Ajax himself, saves from
destruction the hero’s tomb on the Rhoetean shore before Troy; and as he removes the decayed
stones, he returns enriched with gold. How many commentators and chroniclers
vouch for this phenomenon? There are Artemon, Antiphon, Strato, Philochorus, Epicharmus,
Serapion, Cratippus, and Dionysius of Rhodes, and Hermippus—the entire literature of the
age. I shall only laugh at all, if indeed I ought to laugh at the man who fancied that he was
going to persuade us that Saturn dreamt before anybody else; which we can only believe if
Aristotle, (who would fain help us to such an opinion,) lived prior to any other person.
Pray forgive me for laughing. Epicharmus, indeed, as well as Philochorus the Athenian,
assigned the very highest place among divinations to dreams. The whole world is full of
oracles of this description: there are the oracles of Amphiaraus at Oropus, of Amphilochus
at Mallus, of Sarpedon in the Troad, of Trophonius in Boeotia, of Mopsus in Cilicia, of
Hermione in Macedon, of Pasiphäe in Laconia. Then, again, there are others, which with
their original foundations, rites, and historians, together with the entire literature of dreams,
Hermippus of Berytus in five portly volumes will give you all the account of, even to satiety.
But the Stoics are very fond of saying that God, in His most watchful providence over every
institution, gave us dreams amongst other preservatives of the arts and sciences of divination,
<note type="footnote">1772 See an account of her vision and its interpretation in Herodot. iv. 124.</note>

<pb n="473"/>
as the especial support of the natural oracle. So much for the dreams to which credit has to
be ascribed even by ourselves, although we must interpret them in another sense. As for all
other oracles, at which no one ever dreams, what else must we declare concerning them,
than that they are the diabolical contrivance of those spirits who even at that time dwelt in
the eminent persons themselves, or aimed at reviving the memory of them as the mere stage
of their evil purposes, going so far as to counterfeit a divine power under their shape and
form, and, with equal persistence in evil, deceiving men by their very boons of remedies,
warnings, and forecasts,—the only effect of which was to injure their victims the more they
helped them; while the means whereby they rendered the help withdrew them from all
search after the true God, by insinuating into their minds ideas of the false one? And of
course so pernicious an influence as this is not shut up nor limited within the boundaries
of shrines and temples: it roams abroad, it flies through the air, and all the while is free and
unchecked. So that nobody can doubt that our very homes lie open to these diabolical spirits,
who beset their human prey with their fantasies not only in their chapels but also in their
chambers.</p>

<head>Chapter XLVII.—Dreams Variously Classified. Some are God-Sent, as the Dreams
of Nebuchadnezzar; Others Simply Products of Nature.</head>
<p>We declare, then, that dreams are inflicted on us mainly by demons, although they
sometimes turn out true and favourable to us. When, however, with the deliberate aim after
evil, of which we have just spoken, they assume a flattering and captivating style, they show
themselves proportionately vain, and deceitful, and obscure, and wanton, and impure. And
no wonder that the images partake of the character of the realities. But from God—who has
promised, indeed, “to pour out the grace of the Holy Spirit upon all flesh, and has ordained
that His servants and His handmaids should see visions as well as utter prophecies”
1773—must all those visions be regarded as emanating, which may be compared to
the actual grace of God, as being honest, holy, prophetic, inspired, instructive, inviting to
virtue, the bountiful nature of which causes them to overflow even to the profane, since
God, with grand impartiality, “sends His showers and sunshine on the just and on the unjust.”
1774 It was, indeed by an inspiration from God that Nebuchadnezzar dreamt his
dreams;1775 and almost the greater part of mankind get their knowledge of God from dreams.
Thus it is that, as the mercy of God super-abounds to the heathen, so the temptation of the
evil one encounters the saints, from whom he never withdraws his malignant efforts to steal
over them as best he may in their very sleep, if unable to assault them when they are awake.
The third class of dreams will consist of those which the soul itself apparently creates for
itself from an intense application to special circumstances. Now, inasmuch as the soul cannot
dream of its own accord (for even Epicharmus is of this opinion), how can it become to itself
the cause of any vision? Then must this class of dreams be abandoned to the action of nature,
reserving for the soul, even when in the ecstatic condition, the power of enduring whatever
incidents befall it? Those, moreover, which evidently proceed neither from God, nor from
diabolical inspiration, nor from the soul, being beyond the reach as well of ordinary expectation,
usual interpretation, or the possibility of being intelligibly related, will have to be
ascribed in a separate category to what is purely and simply the ecstatic state and its peculiar
conditions.</p>

<head>Chapter XLVIII.—Causes and Circumstances of Dreams. What Best Contributes to
Efficient Dreaming.</head>
<p>They say that dreams are more sure and clear when they happen towards the end of the
night, because then the vigour of the soul emerges, and heavy sleep departs. As to the seasons
of the year, dreams are calmer in spring, since summer relaxes, and winter somehow hardens,
the soul; while autumn, which in other respects is trying to health, is apt to enervate the soul
by the lusciousness of its fruits. Then, again, as regards the position of one’s body during
sleep, one ought not to lie on his back, nor on his right side, nor so as to wrench1776 his intestines,
as if their cavity were reversely stretched: a palpitation of the heart would ensue,
or else a pressure on the liver would produce a painful disturbance of the mind. But however
this be, I take it that it all amounts to ingenious conjecture rather than certain proof (although
the author of the conjecture be no less a man than Plato);1777 and possibly all may be no
other than the result of chance. But, generally speaking, dreams will be under control of a
man’s will, if they be capable of direction at all; for we must not examine what opinion on
the one hand, and superstition on the other, have to prescribe for the treatment of dreams,
in the matter of distinguishing and modifying different sorts of food. As for the superstition,
we have an instance when fasting is prescribed for such persons as mean to submit to the
sleep which is necessary for receiving the oracle, in order that such abstinence may produce
the required purity; while we find an instance of the opinion when the disciples of Pythagoras,
in order to attain the same end, reject the bean as an aliment which would load the stomach,
and produce indigestion. But the three brethren, who were the companions of Daniel, being
content with pulse alone, to escape the contamination of the royal dishes,1778 received from
God, besides other wisdom, the gift especially of penetrating and explaining the sense of
dreams. For my own part, I hardly know whether fasting would not simply make me dream
so profoundly, that I should not be aware whether I had in fact dreamt at all. Well, then,
you ask, has not sobriety something to do in this matter? Certainly it is as much concerned
in this as it is in the entire subject: if it contributes some good service to superstition, much
more does it to religion. For even demons require such discipline from their dreamers as a
gratification to their divinity, because they know that it is acceptable to God, since Daniel
(to quote him again) “ate no pleasant bread” for the space of three weeks.1779 This abstinence,
however, he used in order to please God by humiliation, and not for the purpose of producing
a sensibility and wisdom for his soul previous to receiving communication by dreams and
visions, as if it were not rather to effect such action in an ecstatic state. This sobriety, then,

<head>Chapter XLIX.—No Soul Naturally Exempt from Dreams.</head>
<p>As for those persons who suppose that infants do not dream, on the ground that all the
functions of the soul throughout life are accomplished according to the capacity of age, they
ought to observe attentively their tremors, and nods, and bright smiles as they sleep, and
from such facts understand that they are the emotions of their soul as it dreams, which so
readily escape to the surface through the delicate tenderness of their infantine body. The
fact, however, that the African nation of the Atlantes are said to pass through the night in
a deep lethargic sleep, brings down on them the censure that something is wrong in the
constitution of their soul. Now either report, which is occasionally calumnious against
barbarians, deceived Herodotus,1780 or else a large force of demons of this sort domineers
in those barbarous regions. Since, indeed, Aristotle remarks of a certain hero of Sardinia
that he used to withhold the power of visions and dreams from such as resorted to his shrine
for inspiration, it must lie at the will and caprice of the demons to take away as well as to
confer the faculty of dreams; and from this circumstance may have arisen the remarkable
fact (which we have mentioned1781) of Nero and Thrasymedes only dreaming so late in life.
We, however, derive dreams from God. Why, then, did not the Atlantes receive the
dreaming faculty from God, because there is really no nation which is now a stranger to
God, since the gospel flashes its glorious light through the world to the ends of the earth?
Could it then be that rumour deceived Aristotle, or is this caprice still the way of demons?
(Let us take any view of the case), only do not let it be imagined that any soul is by its natural
constitution exempt from dreams.</p>

<head>Chapter L.—The Absurd Opinion of Epicurus and the Profane Conceits of the
Heretic Menander on Death, Even Enoch and Elijah Reserved for Death.</head>
<p>We have by this time said enough about sleep, the mirror and image of death; and
likewise about the occupations of sleep, even dreams. Let us now go on to consider the cause
of our departure hence—that is, the appointment and course of death—because we must
not leave even it unquestioned and unexamined, although it is itself the very end of all
questions and investigations. According to the general sentiment of the human race, we
declare death to be “the debt of nature.” So much has been settled by the voice of God;1782
such is the contract with everything which is born: so that even from this the frigid conceit
of Epicurus is refuted, who says that no such debt is due from us; and not only so, but the
insane opinion of the Samaritan heretic Menander is also rejected, who will have it that
death has not only nothing to do with his disciples, but in fact never reaches them. He pretends
to have received such a commission from the secret power of One above, that all who
partake of his baptism become immortal, incorruptible and instantaneously invested with
resurrection-life. We read, no doubt, of very many wonderful kinds of waters: how, for instance,
the vinous quality of the stream intoxicates people who drink of the Lyncestis; how
at Colophon the waters of an oracle-inspiring fountain1783 affect men with madness; how
Alexander was killed by the poisonous water from Mount Nonacris in Arcadia. Then, again,
there was in Judea before the time of Christ a pool of medicinal virtue. It is well known how
the poet has commemorated the marshy Styx as preserving men from death; although
Thetis had, in spite of the preservative, to lament her son. And for the matter of that, were
Menander himself to take a plunge into this famous Styx, he would certainly have to die
after all; for you must come to the Styx, placed as it is by all accounts in the regions of the
dead. Well, but what and where are those blessed and charming waters which not even John
Baptist ever used in his preministrations, nor Christ after him ever revealed to His disciples?
What was this wondrous bath of Menander? He is a comical fellow, I ween.1784 But why
(was such a font) so seldom in request, so obscure, one to which so very few ever resorted
for their cleansing? I really see something to suspect in so rare an occurrence of a sacrament
to which is attached so very much security and safety, and which dispenses with the ordinary
law of dying even in the service of God Himself, when, on the contrary, all nations have “to
ascend to the mount of the Lord and to the house of the God of Jacob,” who demands of
His saints in martyrdom that death which He exacted even of His Christ. No one will ascribe
to magic such influence as shall exempt from death, or which shall refresh and vivify life,

like the vine by the renewal of its condition. Such power was not accorded to the great Medea
herself—over a human being at any rate, if allowed her over a silly sheep. Enoch no doubt
was translated,1785 and so was Elijah;1786 nor did they experience death: it was postponed,
(and only postponed,) most certainly: they are reserved for the suffering of death, that by
their blood they may extinguish Antichrist.1787 Even John underwent death, although
concerning him there had prevailed an ungrounded expectation that he would remain alive
until the coming of the Lord.1788 Heresies, indeed, for the most part spring hurriedly into
existence, from examples furnished by ourselves: they procure their defensive armour from
the very place which they attack. The whole question resolves itself, in short, into this challenge:
Where are to be found the men whom Menander himself has baptized? whom he has
plunged into his Styx? Let them come forth and stand before us—those apostles of his whom
he has made immortal? Let my (doubting) Thomas see them, let him hear them, let him

<head>Chapter LI.—Death Entirely Separates the Soul from the Body.</head>
<p>But the operation of death is plain and obvious: it is the separation of body and soul.
Some, however, in reference to the soul’s immortality, on which they have so feeble a hold
through not being taught of God, maintain it with such beggarly arguments, that they would
fain have it supposed that certain souls cleave to the body even after death. It is indeed in
this sense that Plato, although he despatches at once to heaven such souls as he pleases,1789
yet in his Republic1790 exhibits to us the corpse of an unburied person, which was preserved
a long time without corruption, by reason of the soul remaining, as he says, unseparated
from the body. To the same purport also Democritus remarks on the growth for a considerable
while of the human nails and hair in the grave. Now, it is quite possible that the nature
of the atmosphere tended to the preservation of the above-mentioned corpse. What if the
air were particularly dry, and the ground of a saline nature? What, too, if the substance of
the body itself were unusually dry and arid? What, moreover, if the mode of the death had
already eliminated from the corpse all corrupting matter? As for the nails, since they are
the commencement of the nerves, they may well seem to be prolonged, owing to the nerves
themselves being relaxed and extended, and to be protruded more and more as the flesh
fails. The hair, again, is nourished from the brain, which would cause it endure for a long
time as its secret aliment and defence. Indeed, in the case of living persons themselves, the
whole head of hair is copious or scanty in proportion to the exuberance of the brain. You
have medical men (to attest the fact). But not a particle of the soul can possibly remain in
the body, which is itself destined to disappear when time shall have abolished the entire
scene on which the body has played its part. And yet even this partial survival of the soul
finds a place in the opinions of some men; and on this account they will not have the body
consumed at its funeral by fire, because they would spare the small residue of the soul. There
is, however, another way of accounting for this pious treatment, not as if it meant to favour
the relics of the soul, but as if it would avert a cruel custom in the interest even of the body;
since, being human, it is itself undeserving of an end which is also inflicted upon murderers.
The truth is, the soul is indivisible, because it is immortal; (and this fact) compels us to believe
that death itself is an indivisible process, accruing indivisibly to the soul, not indeed because
it is immortal, but because it is indivisible. Death, however, would have to be divided in its
operation, if the soul were divisible into particles, any one of which has to be reserved for a
later stage of death. At this rate, a part of death will have to stay behind for a portion of the
soul. I am not ignorant that some vestige of this opinion still exists. I have found it out from
one of my own people. I am acquainted with the case of a woman, the daughter of Christian
<note type="footnote">1789 See below, ch. liv.</note>

parents,1791 who in the very flower of her age and beauty slept peacefully (in Jesus), after a
singularly happy though brief married life. Before they laid her in her grave, and when the
priest began the appointed office, at the very first breath of his prayer she withdrew her
hands from her side, placed them in an attitude of devotion, and after the holy service was
concluded restored them to their lateral position. Then, again, there is that well-known
story among our own people, that a body voluntarily made way in a certain cemetery, to
afford room for another body to be placed near to it. If, as is the case, similar stories are told
amongst the heathen, (we can only conclude that) God everywhere manifests signs of His
own power—to His own people for their comfort, to strangers for a testimony unto them.
I would indeed much rather suppose that a portent of this kind happened from the direct
agency of God than from any relics of the soul: for if there were a residue of these, they
would be certain to move the other limbs; and even if they moved the hands, this still would
not have been for the purpose of a prayer. Nor would the corpse have been simply content
to have made way for its neighbour: it would, besides, have benefited its own self also by
the change of its position. But from whatever cause proceeded these phenomena, which
you must put down amongst signs and portents, it is impossible that they should regulate
nature. Death, if it once falls short of totality in operation, is not death. If any fraction of
the soul remain, it makes a living state. Death will no more mix with life, than will night
with day.</p>

<head>Chapter LII.—All Kinds of Death a Violence to Nature, Arising from Sin.—Sin an
Intrusion Upon Nature as God Created It.</head>
<p>Such, then, is the work of death—the separation of the soul from the body. Putting out
of the question fates and fortuitous circumstances, it has been, according to men’s views,
distinguished in a twofold form—the ordinary and the extraordinary. The ordinary they
ascribe to nature, exercising its quiet influence in the case of each individual decease; the
extraordinary is said to be contrary to nature, happening in every violent death. As for our
own views, indeed, we know what was man’s origin, and we boldly assert and persistently
maintain that death happens not by way of natural consequence to man, but owing to a
fault and defect which is not itself natural; although it is easy enough, no doubt, to apply
the term natural to faults and circumstances which seem to have been (though from the
emergence of an external cause1792) inseparable to us from our very birth. If man had been
directly appointed to die as the condition of his creation,1793 then of course death must be
imputed to nature. Now, that he was not thus appointed to die, is proved by the very law
which made his condition depend on a warning, and death result from man’s arbitrary
choice. Indeed, if he had not sinned, he certainly would not have died. That cannot be
nature which happens by the exercise of volition after an alternative has been proposed to
it, and not by necessity—the result of an inflexible and unalterable condition. Consequently,
although death has various issues, inasmuch as its causes are manifold, we cannot say that
the easiest death is so gentle as not to happen by violence (to our nature). The very law
which produces death, simple though it be, is yet violence. How can it be otherwise, when
so close a companionship of soul and body, so inseparable a growth together from their
very conception of two sister substances, is sundered and divided? For although a man may
breathe his last for joy, like the Spartan Chilon, while embracing his son who had just
conquered in the Olympic games; or for glory, like the Athenian Clidemus, while receiving
a crown of gold for the excellence of his historical writings; or in a dream, like Plato; or in
a fit of laughter, like Publius Crassus,—yet death is much too violent, coming as it does
upon us by strange and alien means, expelling the soul by a method all its own, calling on
us to die at a moment when one might live a jocund life in joy and honour, in peace and
pleasure. That is still a violence to ships: although far away from the Capharean rocks, assailed
by no storms, without a billow to shatter them, with favouring gale, in gliding course, with
merry crews, they founder amidst entire security, suddenly, owing to some internal shock.
Not dissimilar are the shipwrecks of life,—the issues of even a tranquil death. It matters not
whether the vessel of the human body goes with unbroken timbers or shattered with storms,
if the navigation of the soul be overthrown.</p>

<head>Chapter LIII.—The Entire Soul Being Indivisible Remains to the Last Act of Vitality; Never Partially or Fractionally Withdrawn from the Body.</head>
<p>But where at last will the soul have to lodge, when it is bare and divested of the body?
We must certainly not hesitate to follow it thither, in the order of our inquiry. We must,
however, first of all fully state what belongs to the topic before us, in order that no one, because
we have mentioned the various issues of death, may expect from us a special description
of these, which ought rather to be left to medical men, who are the proper judges of the incidents
which appertain to death, or its causes, and the actual conditions of the human body.
Of course, with the view of preserving the truth of the soul’s immortality, whilst treating
this topic, I shall have, on mentioning death, to introduce phrases about dissolution of such
a purport as seems to intimate that the soul escapes by degrees, and piece by piece; for it
withdraws (from the body) with all the circumstances of a decline, seeming to suffer consumption,
and suggests to us the idea of being annihilated by the slow process of its departure.
But the entire reason of this phenomenon is in the body, and arises from the body. For
whatever be the kind of death (which operates on man), it undoubtedly produces the destruction
either of the matter, or of the region, or of the passages of vitality: of the matter,
such as the gall and the blood; of the region, such as the heart and the liver; of the passages,
such as the veins and the arteries. Inasmuch, then, as these parts of the body are severally
devastated by an injury proper to each of them, even to the very last ruin and annulling of
the vital powers—in other words, of the ends, the sites, and the functions of nature—it must
needs come to pass, amidst the gradual decay of its instruments, domiciles, and spaces, that
the soul also itself, being driven to abandon each successive part, assumes the appearance
of being lessened to nothing; in some such manner as a charioteer is assumed to have himself
failed, when his horses, through fatigue, withdraw from him their energies. But this assumption
applies only to the circumstances of the despoiled person, not to any real condition of
suffering. Likewise the body’s charioteer, the animal spirit, fails on account of the failure of
its vehicle, not of itself—abandoning its work, but not its vigour—languishing in operation,
but not in essential condition—bankrupt in solvency, not in substance—because ceasing to
put in an appearance, but not ceasing to exist. Thus every rapid death—such as a decapitation,
or a breaking of the neck,1794 which opens at once a vast outlet for the soul; or a sudden
ruin, which at a stroke crushes every vital action, like that inner ruin apoplexy—retards not
the soul’s escape, nor painfully separates its departure into successive moments. Where,
however, the death is a lingering one, the soul abandons its position in the way in which it
is itself abandoned. And yet it is not by this process severed in fractions: it is slowly drawn
out; and whilst thus extracted, it causes the last remnant to seem to be but a part of itself.
No portion, however, must be deemed separable, because it is the last; nor, because it is a
<note type="footnote">1794 We have made Tertullian’s “cervicum messis” include both these modes of instantaneous death.</note>

<pb n="484"/>
small one, must it be regarded as susceptible of dissolution. Accordant with a series is its
end, and the middle is prolonged to the extremes; and the remnants cohere to the mass, and
are waited for, but never abandoned by it. And I will even venture to say, that the last of a
whole is the whole; because while it is less, and the latest, it yet belongs to the whole, and
completes it. Hence, indeed, many times it happens that the soul in its actual separation is
more powerfully agitated with a more anxious gaze, and a quickened loquacity; whilst from
the loftier and freer position in which it is now placed, it enunciates, by means of its last
remnant still lingering in the flesh, what it sees, what it hears, and what it is beginning to
know. In Platonic phrase, indeed, the body is a prison,1795 but in the apostle’s it is “the
temple of God,”1796 because it is in Christ. Still, (as must be admitted,) by reason of its enclosure
it obstructs and obscures the soul, and sullies it by the concretion of the flesh; whence
it happens that the light which illumines objects comes in upon the soul in a more confused
manner, as if through a window of horn. Undoubtedly, when the soul, by the power of death,
is released from its concretion with the flesh, it is by the very release cleansed and purified:
it is, moreover, certain that it escapes from the veil of the flesh into open space, to its clear,
and pure, and intrinsic light; and then finds itself enjoying its enfranchisement from matter,
and by virtue of its liberty it recovers its divinity, as one who awakes out of sleep passes from
images to verities. Then it tells out what it sees; then it exults or it fears, according as it finds
what lodging is prepared for it, as soon as it sees the very angel’s face, that arraigner of souls,
the Mercury of the poets.</p>

<head>Chapter LIV.—Whither Does the Soul Retire When It Quits the Body? Opinions
of Philosophers All More or Less Absurd. The Hades of Plato.</head>
<p>To the question, therefore, whither the soul is withdrawn, we now give an answer. Almost
all the philosophers, who hold the soul’s immortality, notwithstanding their special views
on the subject, still claim for it this (eternal condition), as Pythagoras, and Empedocles, and
Plato, and as they who indulge it with some delay from the time of its quitting the flesh to
the conflagration of all things, and as the Stoics, who place only their own souls, that is, the
souls of the wise, in the mansions above. Plato, it is true, does not allow this destination to
all the souls, indiscriminately, of even all the philosophers, but only of those who have cultivated
their philosophy out of love to boys. So great is the privilege which impurity obtains
at the hands of philosophers! In his system, then, the souls of the wise are carried up on
high into the ether: according to Arius,1797 into the air; according to the Stoics, into the
moon. I wonder, indeed, that they abandon to the earth the souls of the unwise, when they
affirm that even these are instructed by the wise, so much their superiors. For where is the
school where they can have been instructed in the vast space which divides them? By what
means can the pupil-souls have resorted to their teachers, when they are parted from each
other by so distant an interval? What profit, too, can any instruction afford them at all in
their posthumous state, when they are on the brink of perdition by the universal fire? All
other souls they thrust down to Hades, which Plato, in his Phædo,1798 describes as the bosom
of the earth, where all the filth of the world accumulates, settles, and exhales, and where
every separate draught of air only renders denser still the impurities of the seething mass.</p>

<head>Chapter LV.—The Christian Idea of the Position of Hades; The Blessedness of
Paradise Immediately After Death. The Privilege of the Martyrs.</head>
<p>By ourselves the lower regions (of Hades) are not supposed to be a bare cavity, nor some
subterranean sewer of the world, but a vast deep space in the interior of the earth, and a
concealed recess in its very bowels; inasmuch as we read that Christ in His death spent three
days in the heart of the earth,1799 that is, in the secret inner recess which is hidden in the
earth, and enclosed by the earth, and superimposed on the abysmal depths which lie still
lower down. Now although Christ is God, yet, being also man, “He died according to the
Scriptures,”1800 and “according to the same Scriptures was buried.”1801 With the same law
of His being He fully complied, by remaining in Hades in the form and condition of a dead
man; nor did He ascend into the heights of heaven before descending into the lower parts
of the earth, that He might there make the patriarchs and prophets partakers of Himself.1802
(This being the case), you must suppose Hades to be a subterranean region, and keep at
arm’s length those who are too proud to believe that the souls of the faithful deserve a place
in the lower regions.1803 These persons, who are “servants above their Lord, and disciples
above their Master,”1804 would no doubt spurn to receive the comfort of the resurrection,
if they must expect it in Abraham’s bosom. But it was for this purpose, say they, that Christ
descended into hell, that we might not ourselves have to descend thither. Well, then, what
difference is there between heathens and Christians, if the same prison awaits them all when
dead? How, indeed, shall the soul mount up to heaven, where Christ is already sitting at the
Father’s right hand, when as yet the archangel’s trumpet has not been heard by the command
of God,1805—when as yet those whom the coming of the Lord is to find on the earth, have
not been caught up into the air to meet Him at His coming,1806 in company with the dead
in Christ, who shall be the first to arise?1807 To no one is heaven opened; the earth is still
safe for him, I would not say it is shut against him. When the world, indeed, shall pass away,
then the kingdom of heaven shall be opened. Shall we then have to sleep high up in ether,
with the boy-loving worthies of Plato; or in the air with Arius; or around the moon with the

Endymions of the Stoics? No, but in Paradise, you tell me, whither already the patriarchs
and prophets have removed from Hades in the retinue of the Lord’s resurrection. How is
it, then, that the region of Paradise, which as revealed to John in the Spirit lay under the altar,
1808 displays no other souls as in it besides the souls of the martyrs? How is it that the
most heroic martyr Perpetua on the day of her passion saw only her fellow-martyrs there,
in the revelation which she received of Paradise, if it were not that the sword which guarded
the entrance permitted none to go in thereat, except those who had died in Christ and not
in Adam? A new death for God, even the extraordinary one for Christ, is admitted into the
reception-room of mortality, specially altered and adapted to receive the new-comer. Observe,
then, the difference between a heathen and a Christian in their death: if you have to lay
down your life for God, as the Comforter1809 counsels, it is not in gentle fevers and on soft
beds, but in the sharp pains of martyrdom: you must take up the cross and bear it after your
Master, as He has Himself instructed you.1810 The sole key to unlock Paradise is your own
life’s blood.1811 You have a treatise by us,1812 (on Paradise), in which we have established

<head>Chapter LVI.—Refutation of the Homeric View of the Soul’s Detention from Hades Owing to the Body’s Being Unburied. That Souls Prematurely Separated from
the Body Had to Wait for Admission into Hades Also Refuted.</head>
<p>There arises the question, whether this takes place immediately after the soul’s departure
from the body; whether some souls are detained for special reasons in the meantime here
on earth; and whether it is permitted them of their own accord, or by the intervention of
authority, to be removed from Hades1813 at some subsequent time? Even such opinions as
these are not by any means lacking persons to advance them with confidence. It was believed
that the unburied dead were not admitted into the infernal regions before they had received
a proper sepulture; as in the case of Homer’s Patroclus, who earnestly asks for a burial of
Achilles in a dream, on the ground that he could not enter Hades through any other portal,
since the souls of the sepulchred dead kept thrusting him away.1814 We know that Homer
exhibited more than a poetic licence here; he had in view the rights of the dead. Proportioned,
indeed, to his care for the just honours of the tomb, was his censure of that delay of burial
which was injurious to souls. (It was also his purpose to add a warning), that no man should,
by detaining in his house the corpse of a friend, only expose himself, along with the deceased,
to increased injury and trouble, by the irregularity1815 of the consolation which he nourishes
with pain and grief. He has accordingly kept a twofold object in view in picturing the complaints
of an unburied soul: he wished to maintain honour to the dead by promptly attending
to their funeral, as well as to moderate the feelings of grief which their memory excited. But,
after all, how vain is it to suppose that the soul could bear the rites and requirements of the
body, or carry any of them away to the infernal regions! And how much vainer still is it, if
injury be supposed to accrue to the soul from that neglect of burial which it ought to receive
rather as a favour! For surely the soul which had no willingness to die might well prefer as
tardy a removal to Hades as possible. It will love the undutiful heir, by whose means it still
enjoys the light. If, however, it is certain that injury accrues to the soul from a tardy interment
of the body—and the gist of the injury lies in the neglect of the burial—it is yet in the highest
degree unfair, that that should receive all the injury to which the faulty delay could not
possibly be imputed, for of course all the fault rests on the nearest relations of the dead.
They also say that those souls which are taken away by a premature death wander about
hither and thither until they have completed the residue of the years which they would have
lived through, had it not been for their untimely fate. Now either their days are appointed
to all men severally, and if so appointed, I cannot suppose them capable of being shortened;
or if, notwithstanding such appointment, they may be shortened by the will of God, or some
<note type="footnote">1813 Ab inferis.</note>
<note type="footnote">1814 Iliad, xxiii. 72, etc.</note>
<note type="footnote">1815 Enormitate.</note>

<pb n="489"/>
other powerful influence, then (I say) such shortening is of no validity, if they still may be
accomplished in some other way. If, on the other hand, they are not appointed, there cannot
be any residue to be fulfilled for unappointed periods. I have another remark to make.
Suppose it be an infant that dies yet hanging on the breast; or it may be an immature boy;
or it may be, once more, a youth arrived at puberty: suppose, moreover, that the life in each
case ought to have reached full eighty years, how is it possible that the soul of either could
spend the whole of the shortened years here on earth after losing the body by death? One’s
age cannot be passed without one’s body, it being by help of the body that the period of life
has its duties and labours transacted. Let our own people, moreover, bear this in mind, that
souls are to receive back at the resurrection the self-same bodies in which they died.
Therefore our bodies must be expected to resume the same conditions and the same ages,
for it is these particulars which impart to bodies their especial modes. By what means, then,
can the soul of an infant so spend on earth its residue of years, that it should be able at the
resurrection to assume the state of an octogenarian, although it had barely lived a month?
Or if it shall be necessary that the appointed days of life be fulfilled here on earth, must the
same course of life in all its vicissitudes, which has been itself ordained to accompany the
appointed days, be also passed through by the soul along with the days? Must it employ itself
in school studies in its passage from infancy to boyhood; play the soldier in the excitement
and vigour of youth and earlier manhood; and encounter serious and judicial responsibilities
in the graver years between ripe manhood and old age? Must it ply trade for profit, turn up
the soil with hoe and plough, go to sea, bring actions at law, get married, toil and labour,
undergo illnesses, and whatever casualties of weal and woe await it in the lapse of years?
Well, but how are all these transactions to be managed without one’s body? Life (spent)
without life? But (you will tell me) the destined period in question is to be bare of all incident
whatever, only to be accomplished by merely elapsing. What, then, is to prevent its being
fulfilled in Hades, where there is absolutely no use to which you can apply it? We therefore
maintain that every soul, whatever be its age on quitting the body, remains unchanged in
the same, until the time shall come when the promised perfection shall be realized in a state
duly tempered to the measure of the peerless angels. Hence those souls must be accounted
as passing an exile in Hades, which people are apt to regard as carried off by violence, especially
by cruel tortures, such as those of the cross, and the axe, and the sword, and the lion;
but we do not account those to be violent deaths which justice awards, that avenger of violence.
So then, you will say, it is all the wicked souls that are banished in Hades. (Not quite
so fast, is my answer.) I must compel you to determine (what you mean by Hades), which
of its two regions, the region of the good or of the bad. If you mean the bad, (all I can say
is, that) even now the souls of the wicked deserve to be consigned to those abodes; if you
mean the good why should you judge to be unworthy of such a resting-place the souls of

<head>Chapter LVII.—Magic and Sorcery Only Apparent in Their Effects. God Alone Can
Raise the Dead.</head>
<p>It is either a very fine thing to be detained in these infernal regions with the Aori, or
souls which were prematurely hurried away; or else a very bad thing indeed to be there associated
with the Biaeothanati, who suffered violent deaths. I may be permitted to use the
actual words and terms with which magic rings again, that inventor of all these odd opinions—
with its Ostanes, and Typhon, and Dardanus, and Damigeron, and Nectabis, and
Berenice. There is a well-known popular bit of writing,1817 which undertakes to summon
up from the abode of Hades the souls which have actually slept out their full age, and had
passed away by an honourable death, and had even been buried with full rites and proper
ceremony. What after this shall we say about magic? Say, to be sure, what almost everybody
says of it—that it is an imposture. But it is not we Christians only whose notice this system
of imposture does not escape. We, it is true, have discovered these spirits of evil, not, to be
sure, by a complicity with them, but by a certain knowledge which is hostile to them; nor
is it by any procedure which is attractive to them, but by a power which subjugates them
that we handle (their wretched system)—that manifold pest of the mind of man, that artificer
of all error, that destroyer of our salvation and our soul at one swoop.1818 In this way, even
by magic, which is indeed only a second idolatry, wherein they pretend that after death they
become demons, just as they were supposed in the first and literal idolatry to become gods
(and why not? since the gods are but dead things), the before-mentioned Aori Biaeothanati
are actually invoked,—and not unfairly,1819 if one grounds his faith on this principle, that
it is clearly credible for those souls to be beyond all others addicted to violence and wrong,
which with violence and wrong have been hurried away by a cruel and premature death and
which would have a keen appetite for reprisals. Under cover, however, of these souls, demons
operate, especially such as used to dwell in them when they were in life, and who had driven
them, in fact, to the fate which had at last carried them off. For, as we have already suggested,
1820 there is hardly a human being who is unattended by a demon; and it is well known
to many, that premature and violent deaths, which men ascribe to accidents, are in fact
brought about by demons. This imposture of the evil spirit lying concealed in the persons
of the dead, we are able, if I mistake not, to prove by actual facts, when in cases of exorcism
(the evil spirit) affirms himself sometimes to be one of the relatives1821 of the person pos-

sessed by him, sometimes a gladiator or a bestiarius,1822 and sometimes even a god; always
making it one of his chief cares to extinguish the very truth which we are proclaiming, that
men may not readily believe that all souls remove to Hades, and that they may overthrow
faith in the resurrection and the judgment. And yet for all that, the demon, after trying to
circumvent the bystanders, is vanquished by the pressure of divine grace, and sorely against
his will confesses all the truth. So also in that other kind of magic, which is supposed to
bring up from Hades the souls now resting there, and to exhibit them to public view, there
is no other expedient of imposture ever resorted to which operates more powerfully. Of
course, why a phantom becomes visible, is because a body is also attached to it; and it is no
difficult matter to delude the external vision of a man whose mental eye it is so easy to blind.
The serpents which emerged from the magicians’ rods, certainly appeared to Pharaoh and
to the Egyptians as bodily substances. It is true that the verity of Moses swallowed up their
lying deceit.1823 Many attempts were also wrought against the apostles by the sorcerers Simon
and Elymas,1824 but the blindness which struck (them) was no enchanter’s trick. What
novelty is there in the effort of an unclean spirit to counterfeit the truth? At this very time,
even, the heretical dupes of this same Simon (Magus) are so much elated by the extravagant
pretensions of their art, that they undertake to bring up from Hades the souls of the
prophets themselves. And I suppose that they can do so under cover of a lying wonder. For,
indeed, it was no less than this that was anciently permitted to the Pythonic (or ventriloquistic)
spirit1825—even to represent the soul of Samuel, when Saul consulted the dead, after
(losing the living) God.1826 God forbid, however, that we should suppose that the soul of
any saint, much less of a prophet, can be dragged out of (its resting-place in Hades) by a
demon. We know that “Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light”1827—much
more into a man of light—and that at last he will “show himself to be even God,”1828 and
will exhibit “great signs and wonders, insomuch that, if it were possible, he shall deceive the
very elect.”1829 He hardly1830 hesitated on the before-mentioned occasion to affirm himself
to be a prophet of God, and especially to Saul, in whom he was then actually dwelling. You
must not imagine that he who produced the phantom was one, and he who consulted it was
1822 One who fought with wild beasts in the public games, only without the weapons allowed to the gladiator.

another; but that it was one and the same spirit, both in the sorceress and in the apostate
(king), which easily pretended an apparition of that which it had already prepared them to
believe as real—(even the spirit) through whose evil influence Saul’s heart was fixed where
his treasure was, and where certainly God was not. Therefore it came about, that he saw
him through whose aid he believed that he was going to see, because he believed him through
whose help he saw. But we are met with the objection, that in visions of the night dead persons
are not unfrequently seen, and that for a set purpose.1831 For instance, the Nasamones
consult private oracles by frequent and lengthened visits to the sepulchres of their relatives,
as one may find in Heraclides, or Nymphodorus, or Herodotus;1832 and the Celts, for the
same purpose, stay away all night at the tombs of their brave chieftains, as Nicander affirms.
Well, we admit apparitions of dead persons in dreams to be not more really true than those
of living persons; but we apply the same estimate to all alike—to the dead and to the living,
and indeed to all the phenomena which are seen. Now things are not true because they appear
to be so, but because they are fully proved to be so. The truth of dreams is declared from
the realization, not the aspect. Moreover, the fact that Hades is not in any case opened for
(the escape of) any soul, has been firmly established by the Lord in the person of Abraham,
in His representation of the poor man at rest and the rich man in torment.1833 No one, (he
said,) could possibly be despatched from those abodes to report to us how matters went in
the nether regions,—a purpose which, (if any could be,) might have been allowable on such
an occasion, to persuade a belief in Moses and the prophets. The power of God has, no
doubt, sometimes recalled men’s souls to their bodies, as a proof of His own transcendent
rights; but there must never be, because of this fact, any agreement supposed to be possible
between the divine faith and the arrogant pretensions of sorcerers, and the imposture of
dreams, and the licence of poets. But yet in all cases of a true resurrection, when the power
of God recalls souls to their bodies, either by the agency of prophets, or of Christ, or of
apostles, a complete presumption is afforded us, by the solid, palpable, and ascertained
reality (of the revived body), that its true form must be such as to compel one’s belief of the
fraudulence of every incorporeal apparition of dead persons.</p>

<head>Chapter LVIII.—Conclusion. Points Postponed. All Souls are Kept in Hades Until the Resurrection, Anticipating Their Ultimate Misery or Bliss.</head>
<p>All souls, therefore, are shut up within Hades: do you admit this? (It is true, whether)
you say yes or no: moreover, there are already experienced there punishments and consolations;
and there you have a poor man and a rich. And now, having postponed some stray
questions1834 for this part of my work, I will notice them in this suitable place, and then
come to a close. Why, then, cannot you suppose that the soul undergoes punishment and
consolation in Hades in the interval, while it awaits its alternative of judgment, in a certain
anticipation either of gloom or of glory? You reply: Because in the judgment of God its
matter ought to be sure and safe, nor should there be any inkling beforehand of the award
of His sentence; and also because (the soul) ought to be covered first by its vestment1835 of
the restored flesh, which, as the partner of its actions, should be also a sharer in its recompense.
What, then, is to take place in that interval? Shall we sleep? But souls do not sleep
even when men are alive: it is indeed the business of bodies to sleep, to which also belongs
death itself, no less than its mirror and counterfeit sleep. Or will you have it, that nothing
is there done whither the whole human race is attracted, and whither all man’s expectation
is postponed for safe keeping? Do you think this state is a foretaste of judgment, or its actual
commencement? a premature encroachment on it, or the first course in its full ministration?
Now really, would it not be the highest possible injustice, even1836 in Hades, if all were to
be still well with the guilty even there, and not well with the righteous even yet? What, would
you have hope be still more confused after death? would you have it mock us still more with
uncertain expectation? or shall it now become a review of past life, and an arranging of
judgment, with the inevitable feeling of a trembling fear? But, again, must the soul always
tarry for the body, in order to experience sorrow or joy? Is it not sufficient, even of itself, to
suffer both one and the other of these sensations? How often, without any pain to the body,
is the soul alone tortured by ill-temper, and anger, and fatigue, and very often unconsciously,
even to itself? How often, too, on the other hand, amidst bodily suffering, does the soul seek
out for itself some furtive joy, and withdraw for the moment from the body’s importunate
society? I am mistaken if the soul is not in the habit, indeed, solitary and alone, of rejoicing
and glorifying over the very tortures of the body. Look for instance, at the soul of Mutius
Scævola as he melts his right hand over the fire; look also at Zeno’s, as the torments of Di-

onysius pass over it.1837 The bites of wild beasts are a glory to young heroes, as on Cyrus
were the scars of the bear.1838 Full well, then, does the soul even in Hades know how to joy
and to sorrow even without the body; since when in the flesh it feels pain when it likes,
though the body is unhurt; and when it likes it feels joy though the body is in pain. Now if
such sensations occur at its will during life, how much rather may they not happen after
death by the judicial appointment of God! Moreover, the soul executes not all its operations
with the ministration of the flesh; for the judgment of God pursues even simple cogitations
and the merest volitions. “Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed
adultery with her already in his heart.”1839 Therefore, even for this cause it is most fitting
that the soul, without at all waiting for the flesh, should be punished for what it has done
without the partnership of the flesh. So, on the same principle, in return for the pious and
kindly thoughts in which it shared not the help of the flesh, shall it without the flesh receive
its consolation. Nay more,1840 even in matters done through the flesh the soul is the first
to conceive them, the first to arrange them, the first to authorize them, the first to precipitate
them into acts. And even if it is sometimes unwilling to act, it is still the first to treat the
object which it means to effect by help of the body. In no case, indeed, can an accomplished
fact be prior to the mental conception1841 thereof. It is therefore quite in keeping with this
order of things, that that part of our nature should be the first to have the recompense and
reward to which they are due on account of its priority. In short, inasmuch as we understand
“the prison” pointed out in the Gospel to be Hades,1842 and as we also interpret “the uttermost
farthing”1843 to mean the very smallest offence which has to be recompensed there
before the resurrection,1844 no one will hesitate to believe that the soul undergoes in Hades
some compensatory discipline, without prejudice to the full process of the resurrection,
when the recompense will be administered through the flesh besides. This point the Paraclete
has also pressed home on our attention in most frequent admonitions, whenever any of us
has admitted the force of His words from a knowledge of His promised spiritual disclosures.
1845 And now at last having, as I believe, encountered every human opinion concerning
the soul, and tried its character by the teaching of (our holy faith,) we have satisfied the

<head>TERTULLIAN.</head>
<head>PART SECOND.</head>

 <div type="commentary" subtype="introduction">
<pb n="498"/>
<head>Introduction, by the American Editor.</head>
<p>The Second Class of Tertullian’s works, according to the logical method I have endeavoured
to carry out, is that which includes his treatises against the heresies of his times. In
these, the genius of our author is brilliantly illustrated, while, in melancholy fact, he is
demonstrating the folly of his own final lapse and the wickedness of that schism and heresy
into which he fell away from Truth. Were it not that history abounds in like examples of
the frailty of the human intellect and of the insufficiency of “man that walketh to direct his
steps,” we should be forced to a theory of mental decay to account for inconsistencies so
gross and for delusions so besotted. “Genius to madness is indeed allied,” and who knows
but something like that imbecility which closed the career of Swift1846 may have been the
fate of this splendid wit and versatile man of parts? Charity, admiration and love force this
inquiry upon my own mind continually, as I explore his fascinating pages. And the order
in which the student will find them in this series, will lead, I think, to similar reflections on
the part of many readers. We observe a natural bent and turn of mind, even in his Catholic
writings, which indicate his perils. These are more and more apparent in his recent works,
as his enthusiasm heats itself into a frenzy which at last becomes a rage. He breaks down by
degrees, as in orthodoxy so also in force and in character. It is almost like the collapse of
Solomon or of Bacon. And though our own times have produced no example of stars of
equal magnitude, to become falling-stars, we have seen illustrations the most humiliating,
of those calm words of Bishop Kaye: “Human nature often presents the curious phenomenon
of an union of the most opposite qualities in the same mind; of vigour, acuteness and discrimination
on some subjects, with imbecility, dulness and bigotry on others.” Milton,
himself another example of his own threnode, breaks forth in this splendid utterance of
lyrical confession:
<lg>
<l>“God of our fathers what is man?</l>
<l rend=" indent">Nor do I name of men the common rout,</l>
<l rend=" indent">That, wandering loose about,</l>
<l>Grow up and perish as the summer fly,</l>
<l>Heads without name, no more remembered,</l>
<l>But such as thou hast solemnly elected,</l>
<l>With gifts and graces eminently adorned,</l>
<l>To some great work, thy glory</l>
<l rend=" indent">And people’s safety, which in part they effect.”</l>
</lg>
</p>
<note type="footnote">1846 “From Marlboro’s eyes the tears of dotage flow, And Swift expires a driveller and a show.”</note>

<pb n="499"/>
<p>And here, I must venture a remark on the ambiguity of the expressions concerning our
author’s Montanism. In the treatise against Marcion, written late in his career, Tertullian
identifies himself with the Church and strenuously defends its faith and its apostolic order.
In only rare instances does his weakness for the “new prophecy” crop out, and then, it is
only as one identifies himself with a school within the church. Precisely so Fenelon maintained
his milder Montanism, without a thought of deserting the Latin Church. Afterwards
Fenelon drew back, but at last poor Tertullian fell away. So with the Jansenists. They credited
the miracles and the convulsions (or ecstasies) of their school,1847 and condemned those
who rejected them, as Tertullian condemns the Psychics. The great expounder of the Nicene
Faith (Bp. Bull) does indeed speak very decidedly of Tertullian as a lapser, even when he
wrote his first book against Marcion. His semi-schismatic position must be allowed. But,
was it a formal lapse at that time? The English non-jurors were long in communion with
the Church, even while they denounced their brethren and the “Erastianizing” clergy, much
as Tertullian does the Psychics. St. Augustine speaks of Tertullianists1848 with great moderation,
and notes the final downfall of our author as something distinct from Tertullianism.
When we reflect, therefore, that only four of all his varied writings (now extant) are proofs
of an accomplished lapse, ought we not carefully to maintain the distinction between the
Montanistic Tertullian and Tertullian the Montanist? Bishop Bull, it seems to me would
not object to this way of putting it, when we consider his own discrimination in the following
weighty words. He says:</p>
<p>“A clear distinction must be made between those works which Tertullian, when already
a Montanist, wrote specifically in defence of Montanism against the church, and those which
he composed, as a Montanist indeed, yet not in defence of Montanism against the church,
but rather, in defence of the common doctrines of the church—and of Montanus, in opposition
to other heretics.”</p>
<p>Now in arranging the works of this second class, the Prescription comes logically first,
because, written in Orthodoxy, it forcibly upholds the Scriptural Rule of Faith, the Catholic
touchstone of all professed verity. It is also a necessary Introduction to the great work against
Marcion which I have placed next in order; giving it the precedence to which it is entitled
in part on chronological ground, in part because of the general purity of its material with
the exhibition it presents of the author’s mental processes and of his very gradual decline
from Truth.</p>
<p>Very fortunate were the Edinburgh Editors in securing for this work and some others,
the valuable labours of Dr. Holmes, of whom I have elsewhere given some biographical
<note type="footnote">1847 See the story of the Abbé Paris, Guettée, Histoire de L’Eglise de France, Tom. xii. p. 12. Also, Parton,

particulars. The merit and fulness of his annotations are so marked, that I have been spared
a great deal of work, such as I was forced to bestow on the former volumes of this American
Edition. But on the other hand these pages have given me much patient study and toil as
an editor, because of the “shreds and patches” in which Tertullian comes to us, in the Edinburgh
Series; and because of some typographical peculiarities, exceptional in that Series itself,
and presenting complications, when transferred to a new form of mechanical arrangement.
For example, apart from some valuable material which belongs to the General Preface, and
which I have transferred accordingly, the following dislocations confronted me to begin
with: The Marcion is presented to us in Volume VII. apart from the other writings of Tertullian.
At the close of Vol. XI. we reach the Ad Nationes, of which Dr. Holmes is the
translator, another hand (Mr. Thelwall’s) having been employed on former pages of that
volume. It is not till we reach Volume XV. that Tertullian again appears, but this volume
is wholly the work of Dr. Holmes. Finally, in Volume XVIII., we meet Tertullian again,
(Mr. Thelwall the able translator), but, here is placed the “Introduction” to all the works of
Tertullian, which, of course, I have, transferred to its proper place. I make these explanations
by no means censoriously, but to point out at once the nature of my own task, and the advantage
that accrues to the reader, by the order in which the works of the great Tertullian
appear in this edition, enabling him to compare different or parallel passages, all methodically
arranged in consecutive pages, without a minute’s search, or delay.</p>
<p>Now, as to typographical difficulties to which I have referred, Dr. Holmes marks all his
multiplied and useful notes with brackets, which are almost always superfluous, and which
in this American Edition are used to designate my own contributions, when printed with
the text, or apart from Preface and Elucidations. These, therefore, I have removed necessarily
and with no appreciable loss to the work, but great gain to the beauty of the page. But, again,
Dr. Holmes’ translations are all so heavily bracketed as to become an eyesore, and the disfigured
pages have been often complained of as afflictive to the reader. Many words strictly
implied by the original Latin, and which should therefore be unmarked, are yet put between
brackets. Even minute words (and, or to wit, or again,) when, in the nature of the case the
English idiom requires them, are thus marked. I have not retained these blemishes; but when
an inconsiderable word or a repetition does add to the sense, or qualify it, I have italicized
such words, throwing more important interpolations into parenthetical marks, which are
less painful to the sight than brackets. I have found them quite as serviceable to denote the
auxiliary word or phrase; and where the author himself uses a parenthesis, I have observed
very few instances in which a sensible reader would confound it with the translator’s efforts
to eke out the sense. Sometimes, an awkward interpolation has been thrown into a footnote.
Occasionally the crabbed sentences of the great Carthaginian are so obscure that Dr. Holmes
has been unable to make them lucid, although, with the original in hand, he probably felt a
force in his own rendering which the mere English reader must fail to perceive. In a few

<pb n="501"/>
such instances, noting the fact in the margin, I have tried to bring out the sense, by slight
modifications of punctuation and arrangement. Occasionally too I have dropped a superfluous
interpolation (such as e.g., to conclude, or let me say again,) when I have found that it
only served to clog and overcharge a sentence. Last of all, Dr. Holmes’ headings have
sometimes been condensed, to avoid phrases and sentences immediately recurring in the
chapter.1849 These purely mechanical parts require a terse form of statement, like those in
the English Bible, and I have frequently reduced them on that model, dropping redundant
adverbs and adjectives to bring out the catchwords.</p>
<note type="footnote">1849 Take e.g. the heading to chapter xxiv. of the De Præscriptione. It reads thus: “St. Peter’s further vindication.
St. Paul was not at all superior to St. Peter in teaching. Nothing was imparted to the former, in the “third heaven,”
to enable him to add to the faith—however foolishly the heretics may boast of him as if they had, forsooth, been
favoured with some of the secrets so imparted to him in paradise.” If the reader will turn to the chapter referred
to, he will observe an instance of condensation by which nothing is forfeited that is requisite to a heading, though
redundancies are dropped.</note>

<p>The character of the times in which we live is such as to call forth from us even this admonition,
that we ought not to be astonished at the heresies (which abound)1851 neither
ought their existence to surprise us, for it was foretold that they should come to pass;1852
nor the fact that they subvert the faith of some, for their final cause is, by affording a trial
to faith, to give it also the opportunity of being “approved.”1853 Groundless, therefore, and
inconsiderate is the offence of the many1854 who are scandalized by the very fact that heresies
prevail to such a degree. How great (might their offence have been) if they had not existed.1855
When it has been determined that a thing must by all means be, it receives the (final) cause
for which it has its being. This secures the power through which it exists, in such a way that
it is impossible for it not to have existence.</p>

hæreticorum is used in an objective sense, as if adversus hæreticos. Tertullian himself, in de Carne Christi, ii.

At: Their Strength Derived from Weakness of Men’s Faith. They Have Not the
Truth. Simile of Pugilists and Gladiators in Illustration.</head>
<p>Taking the similar case1856 of fever, which is appointed a place amongst all other deadly
and excruciating issues (of life) for destroying man: we are not surprised either that it exists,
for there it is, or that it consumes man, for that is the purpose of its existence. In like manner,
with respect to heresies, which are produced for the weakening and the extinction of faith,
since we feel a dread because they have this power, we should first dread the fact of their
existence; for as long as they exist, they have their power; and as long as they have their
power, they have their existence. But still fever, as being an evil both in its cause1857 and in
its power, as all know, we rather loathe than wonder at, and to the best of our power guard
against, not having its extirpation in our power. Some men prefer wondering at heresies,
however, which bring with them eternal death and the heat of a stronger fire, for possessing
this power, instead of avoiding their power when they have the means of escape: but heresies
would have no power, if (men) would cease to wonder that they have such power. For it
either happens that, while men wonder, they fall into a snare, or, because they are ensnared,
they cherish their surprise, as if heresies were so powerful because of some truth which belonged
to them. It would no doubt be a wonderful thing that evil should have any force of
its own, were it not that heresies are strong in those persons who are not strong in faith. In
a combat of boxers and gladiators, generally speaking, it is not because a man is strong that
he gains the victory, or loses it because he is not strong, but because he who is vanquished
was a man of no strength; and indeed this very conqueror, when afterwards matched against
a really powerful man, actually retires crest-fallen from the contest. In precisely the same
way, heresies derive such strength as they have from the infirmities of individuals—having
no strength whenever they encounter a really powerful faith.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Weak People Fall an Easy Prey to Heresy, Which Derives Strength
from the General Frailty of Mankind. Eminent Men Have Fallen from Faith;
Saul, David, Solomon. The Constancy of Christ.</head>
<p>It is usual, indeed, with persons of a weaker character, to be so built up (in confidence)
by certain individuals who are caught by heresy, as to topple over into ruin themselves. How
comes it to pass, (they ask), that this woman or that man, who were the most faithful, the
most prudent, and the most approved1858 in the church, have gone over to the other side?
Who that asks such a question does not in fact reply to it himself, to the effect that men
whom heresies have been able to pervert1859 ought never to have been esteemed prudent,
or faithful, or approved? This again is, I suppose, an extraordinary thing, that one who has
been approved should afterwards fall back? Saul, who was good beyond all others, is afterwards
subverted by envy.1860 David, a good man “after the Lord’s own heart,”1861 is guilty
afterwards of murder and adultery.1862 Solomon, endowed by the Lord with all grace and
wisdom, is led into idolatry, by women.1863 For to the Son of God alone was it reserved to
persevere to the last without sin.1864 But what if a bishop, if a deacon, if a widow, if a virgin,
if a doctor, if even a martyr,1865 have fallen from the rule (of faith), will heresies on that
account appear to possess1866 the truth? Do we prove the faith1867 by the persons, or the
persons by the faith? No one is wise, no one is faithful, no one excels in dignity,1868 but the
Christian; and no one is a Christian but he who perseveres even to the end.1869 You, as a
man, know any other man from the outside appearance. You think as you see. And you see

hath not planted, He rooteth up;”1873 and “the first shall,” as He shows, “be last;”1874 and

faith fly off as much as it will at every blast of temptation, all the purer will be that heap of
corn which shall be laid up in the garner of the Lord. Did not certain of the disciples turn
back from the Lord Himself,1876 when they were offended? Yet the rest did not therefore
think that they must turn away from following Him,1877 but because they knew that He was
the Word of Life, and was come from God,1878 they continued in His company to the very
last, after He had gently inquired of them whether they also would go away.1879 It is a
comparatively small thing,1880 that certain men, like Phygellus, and Hermogenes, and Philetus,
and Hymenæus, deserted His apostle:1881 the betrayer of Christ was himself one of
the apostles. We are surprised at seeing His churches forsaken by some men, although the
things which we suffer after the example of Christ Himself, show us to be Christians. “They
went out from us,” says (St. John,) “but they were not of us. If they had been of us, they
would no doubt have continued with us.”1882</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Warnings Against Heresy Given Us in the New Testament. Sundry
Passages Adduced. These Imply the Possibility of Falling into Heresy.</head>
<p>But let us rather be mindful of the sayings of the Lord, and of the letters of the apostles;
for they have both told us beforehand that there shall be heresies, and have given us, in anticipation,
warnings to avoid them; and inasmuch as we are not alarmed because they exist,
so we ought not to wonder that they are capable of doing that, on account of which they
must be shunned. The Lord teaches us that many “ravening wolves shall come in sheep’s
clothing.”1883 Now, what are these sheep’s clothing’s, but the external surface of the Christian
profession? Who are the ravening wolves but those deceitful senses and spirits which
are lurking within to waste the flock of Christ? Who are the false prophets but deceptive
predictors of the future? Who are the false apostles but the preachers of a spurious gospel?1884
Who also are the Antichrists, both now and evermore, but the men who rebel against
Christ?1885 Heresies, at the present time, will no less rend the church by their perversion of
doctrine, than will Antichrist persecute her at that day by the cruelty of his attacks,1886 except
that persecution make seven martyrs, (but) heresy only apostates. And therefore “heresies
must needs be in order that they which are approved might be made manifest,”1887 both
those who remained stedfast under persecution, and those who did not wander out of their
way1888 into heresy. For the apostle does not mean1889 that those persons should be deemed
approved who exchange their creed for heresy; although they contrariously interpret his
words to their own side, when he says in another passage, “Prove all things; hold fast that
which is good;”1890 as if, after proving all things amiss, one might not through error make
a determined choice of some evil thing.</p>

Who Speaks of the Necessity of Heresies, Not as a Good, But, by the Will of God,
Salutary Trials for Training and Approving the Faith of Christians.</head>
<p>Moreover, when he blames dissensions and schisms, which undoubtedly are evils, he
immediately adds heresies likewise. Now, that which he subjoins to evil things, he of course
confesses to be itself an evil; and all the greater, indeed, because he tells us that his belief of
their schisms and dissensions was grounded on his knowledge that “there must be heresies
also.”1891 For he shows us that it was owing to the prospect of the greater evil that he readily
believed the existence of the lighter ones; and so far indeed was he from believing, in respect
of evils (of such a kind), that heresies were good, that his object was to forewarn us that we
ought not to be surprised at temptations of even a worse stamp, since (he said) they tended
“to make manifest all such as were approved;”1892 in other words, those whom they were
unable to pervert.1893 In short, since the whole passage1894 points to the maintenance of
unity and the checking of divisions, inasmuch as heresies sever men from unity no less than
schisms and dissensions, no doubt he classes heresies under the same head of censure as he
does schisms also and dissensions. And by so doing, he makes those to be “not approved,”
who have fallen into heresies; more especially when with reproofs he exhorts1895 men to
turn away from such, teaching them that they should “all speak and think the selfsame
thing,”1896 the very object which heresies do not permit.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—Heretics are Self-Condemned. Heresy is Self-Will, Whilst Faith is
Submission of Our Will to the Divine Authority. The Heresy of Apelles.</head>
<p>On this point, however, we dwell no longer, since it is the same Paul who, in his Epistle
to the Galatians, counts “heresies” among “the sins of the flesh,”1897 who also intimates to
Titus, that “a man who is a heretic” must be “rejected after the first admonition,” on the
ground that “he that is such is perverted, and committeth sin, as a self-condemned man.”1898
Indeed, in almost every epistle, when enjoining on us (the duty) of avoiding false doctrines,
he sharply condemns1899 heresies. Of these the practical effects1900 are false doctrines, called
in Greek heresies,1901 a word used in the sense of that choice which a man makes when he
either teaches them (to others)1902 or takes up with them (for himself).1903 For this reason
it is that he calls the heretic self-condemned,1904 because he has himself chosen that for
which he is condemned. We, however, are not permitted to cherish any object1905 after our
own will, nor yet to make choice of that which another has introduced of his private fancy.
In the Lord’s apostles we possess our authority; for even they did not of themselves choose
to introduce anything, but faithfully delivered to the nations (of mankind) the doctrine1906
which they had received from Christ. If, therefore, even “an angel from heaven should preach
any other gospel” (than theirs), he would be called accursed1907 by us. The Holy Ghost had
even then foreseen that there would be in a certain virgin (called) Philumene1908 an angel
of deceit, “transformed into an angel of light,”1909 by whose miracles and illusions1910
Apelles was led (when) he introduced his new heresy.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—Pagan Philosophy the Parent of Heresies. The Connection Between
Deflections from Christian Faith and the Old Systems of Pagan Philosophy.</head>
<p>These are “the doctrines” of men and “of demons”1911 produced for itching ears of the
spirit of this world’s wisdom: this the Lord called “foolishness,”1912 and “chose the foolish
things of the world” to confound even philosophy itself. For (philosophy) it is which is the
material of the world’s wisdom, the rash interpreter of the nature and the dispensation of
God. Indeed1913 heresies are themselves instigated1914 by philosophy. From this source
came the Æons, and I known not what infinite forms,1915 and the trinity of man1916 in the
system of Valentinus, who was of Plato’s school. From the same source came Marcion’s
better god, with all his tranquillity; he came of the Stoics. Then, again, the opinion that the
soul dies is held by the Epicureans; while the denial of the restoration of the body is taken
from the aggregate school of all the philosophers; also, when matter is made equal to God,
then you have the teaching of Zeno; and when any doctrine is alleged touching a god of fire,
then Heraclitus comes in. The same subject-matter is discussed over and over again1917 by
the heretics and the philosophers; the same arguments1918 are involved. Whence comes
evil? Why is it permitted? What is the origin of man? and in what way does he come? Besides
the question which Valentinus has very lately proposed—Whence comes God? Which he
settles with the answer: From enthymesis and ectroma.1919 Unhappy Aristotle! who invented
for these men dialectics, the art of building up and pulling down; an art so evasive in its
propositions,1920 so far-fetched in its conjectures, so harsh, in its arguments, so productive
of contentions—embarrassing1921 even to itself, retracting everything, and really treating

of1922 nothing! Whence spring those “fables and endless genealogies,”1923 and “unprofitable
questions,”1924 and “words which spread like a cancer?”1925 From all these, when the apostle
would restrain us, he expressly names philosophy as that which he would have us be on our
guard against. Writing to the Colossians, he says, “See that no one beguile you through
philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, and contrary to the wisdom of the
Holy Ghost.”1926 He had been at Athens, and had in his interviews (with its philosophers)
become acquainted with that human wisdom which pretends to know the truth, whilst it
only corrupts it, and is itself divided into its own manifold heresies, by the variety of its
mutually repugnant sects. What indeed has Athens to do with Jerusalem? What concord is
there between the Academy and the Church? what between heretics and Christians? Our
instruction comes from “the porch of Solomon,”1927 who had himself taught that “the Lord
should be sought in simplicity of heart.”1928 Away with1929 all attempts to produce a mottled
Christianity of Stoic, Platonic, and dialectic composition! We want no curious disputation
after possessing Christ Jesus, no inquisition after enjoying the gospel! With our faith, we
desire no further belief. For this is our palmary faith, that there is nothing which we ought
to believe besides.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Christ’s Word, Seek, and Ye Shall Find, No Warrant for Heretical Deviations from the Faith. All Christ’s Words to the Jews are for Us, Not Indeed as Specific Commands, But as Principles to Be Applied.</head>
<p>I come now to the point which (is urged both by our own brethren and by the heretics).
Our brethren adduce it as a pretext for entering on curious inquiries,1930 and the heretics
insist on it for importing the scrupulosity (of their unbelief).1931 It is written, they say, “Seek,
and ye shall find.”1932 Let us remember at what time the Lord said this. I think it was at the
very outset of His teaching, when there was still a doubt felt by all whether He were the
Christ, and when even Peter had not yet declared Him to be the Son of God, and John
(Baptist) had actually ceased to feel assurance about Him.1933 With good reason, therefore,
was it then said, “Seek, and ye shall find,” when inquiry was still be to made of Him who
was not yet become known. Besides, this was said in respect of the Jews. For it is to them
that the whole matter1934 of this reproof1935 pertains, seeing that they had (a revelation)
where they might seek Christ.</p>
<p>“They have,” says He, “Moses and Elias,”1936—in other words, the law and the prophets,
which preach Christ; as also in another place He says plainly, “Search the Scriptures, in
which ye expect (to find) salvation; for they testify of me;”1937 which will be the meaning
of “Seek, and ye shall find.” For it is clear that the next words also apply to the Jews: “Knock,
and it shall be opened unto you.”1938 The Jews had formerly been in covenant with1939 God;
but being afterwards cast off on account of their sins, they began to be1940 without God.
The Gentiles, on the contrary, had never been in covenant with God; they were only as “a
drop from a bucket,” and “as dust from the threshing floor,”1941 and were ever outside the
door. Now, how shall he who was always outside knock at the place where he never was?
What door does he know of, when he has passed through none, either by entrance or ejec-

tion? Is it not rather he who is aware that he once lived within and was thrust out, that
(probably) found the door and knocked thereat? In like manner, “Ask, and ye shall receive,”
1942 is suitably said1943 to one who was aware from whom he ought to ask,—by whom
also some promise had been given; that is to say, “the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of
Jacob.” Now, the Gentiles knew nothing either of Him, or of any of His promises. Therefore
it was to Israel that he spake when He said, “I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house
of Israel.”1944 Not yet had He “cast to the dogs the children’s bread;”1945 not yet did He
charge them to “go into the way of the Gentiles.”1946 It is only at the last that He instructs
them to “go and teach all nations, and baptize them,”1947 when they were so soon to receive
“the Holy Ghost, the Comforter, who should guide them into all the truth.”1948 And this,
too, makes towards the same conclusion. If the apostles, who were ordained1949 to be
teachers to the Gentiles, were themselves to have the Comforter for their teacher, far more
needless1950 was it to say to us, “Seek, and ye shall find,” to whom was to come, without
research,1951 our instruction1952 by the apostles, and to the apostles themselves by the Holy
Ghost. All the Lord’s sayings, indeed, are set forth for all men; through the ears of the Jews
have they passed on to us. Still most of them were addressed to Jewish persons;1953 they
therefore did not constitute instruction properly designed1954 for ourselves, but rather an
example.1955</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—The Research After Definite Truth Enjoined on Us. When We Have
Discovered This, We Should Be Content.</head>
<p>I now purposely1956 relinquish this ground of argument. Let it be granted, that the
words, “Seek, and ye shall find,” were addressed to all men (equally). Yet even here one’s
aim is1957 carefully to determine1958 the sense of the words1959 consistently with1960 (that
reason),1961 which is the guiding principle1962 in all interpretation. (Now) no divine saying
is so unconnected1963 and diffuse, that its words only are to be insisted on, and their connection
left undetermined. But at the outset I lay down (this position) that there is some one,
and therefore definite, thing taught by Christ, which the Gentiles are by all means bound
to believe, and for that purpose to “seek,” in order that they may be able, when they have
“found” it, to believe. However,1964 there can be no indefinite seeking for that which has
been taught as one only definite thing. You must “seek” until you “find,” and believe when
you have found; nor have you anything further to do but to keep what you have believed
provided you believe this besides, that nothing else is to be believed, and therefore nothing
else is to be sought, after you have found and believed what has been taught by Him who
charges you to seek no other thing than that which He has taught.1965 When, indeed, any
man doubts about this, proof will be forthcoming,1966 that we have in our possession1967
that which was taught by Christ. Meanwhile, such is my confidence in our proof, that I
anticipate it, in the shape of an admonition to certain persons, not “to seek” anything beyond
what they have believed—that this is what they ought to have sought, how to avoid1968 interpreting,
“Seek, and ye shall find,” without regard to the rule of reason.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—One Has Succeeded in Finding Definite Truth, When He Believes.
Heretical Wits are Always Offering Many Things for Vain Discussion, But We
are Not to Be Always Seeking.</head>
<p>Now the reason of this saying is comprised in three points: in the matter, in the time,
in the limit.1969 In the matter, so that you must consider what it is you have to seek; in the
time, when you have to seek; in the limit, how long. What you have “to seek,” then, is that
which Christ has taught,1970 (and you must go on seeking) of course for such time as you
fail to find,1971—until indeed you find1972 it. But you have succeeded in finding1973 when
you have believed. For you would not have believed if you had not found; as neither would
you have sought except with a view to find. Your object, therefore, in seeking was to find;
and your object in finding was to believe. All further delay for seeking and finding you have
prevented1974 by believing. The very fruit of your seeking has determined for you this limit.
This boundary1975 has He set for you Himself, who is unwilling that you should believe
anything else than what He has taught, or, therefore, even seek for it. If, however, because
so many other things have been taught by one and another, we are on that account bound
to go on seeking, so long as we are able to find anything, we must (at that rate) be ever
seeking, and never believe anything at all. For where shall be the end of seeking? where the
stop1976 in believing? where the completion in finding? (Shall it be) with Marcion? But
even Valentinus proposes (to us the) maxim, “Seek, and ye shall find.” (Then shall it be)
with Valentinus? Well, but Apelles, too, will assail me with the same quotation; Hebion also,
and Simon, and all in turn, have no other argument wherewithal to entice me, and draw me
over to their side. Thus I shall be nowhere, and still be encountering1977 (that challenge),
“Seek, and ye shall find,” precisely as if I had no resting-place;1978 as if (indeed) I had never

must now be, to have forfeited it. (Dodgson). This seems far-fetched, and inferior to the reading of Pamelius
and his mss.: “et velint me sic esse nusquam;”—or (as Semler puts it) “velint sic nusquam;” i.e., “and they (the</note>

<head>Chapter XI.—After We Have Believed, Search Should Cease; Otherwise It Must End in a Denial of What We Have Believed. No Other Object Proposed for Our Faith.</head>
<p>There is impunity in erring, if there is no delinquency; although indeed to err it is itself
an act of delinquency.1981 With impunity, I repeat, does a man ramble,1982 when he (purposely)
deserts nothing. But yet, if I have believed what I was bound to believe, and then
afterwards think that there is something new to be sought after, I of course expect that there
is something else to be found, although I should by no means entertain such expectation,
unless it were because I either had not believed, although I apparently had become a believer,
or else have ceased to believe. If I thus desert my faith, I am found to be a denier thereof.
Once for all I would say, No man seeks, except him who either never possessed, or else has
lost (what he sought). The old woman (in the Gospel)1983 had lost one of her ten pieces of
silver, and therefore she sought it;1984 when, however, she found it, she ceased to look for
it. The neighbour was without bread, and therefore he knocked; but as soon as the door was
opened to him, and he received the bread, he discontinued knocking.1985 The widow kept
asking to be heard by the judge, because she was not admitted; but when her suit was heard,
thenceforth she was silent.1986 So that there is a limit both to seeking, and to knocking, and
to asking. “For to every one that asketh,” says He, “it shall be given, and to him that knocketh
it shall be opened, and by him that seeketh it shall be found.”1987 Away with the man1988
who is ever seeking because he never finds; for he seeks there where nothing can be found.
Away with him who is always knocking because it will never be opened to him; for he knocks
where there is none (to open). Away with him who is always asking because he will never
be heard; for he asks of one who does not hear.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—A Proper Seeking After Divine Knowledge, Which Will Never Be
Out of Place or Excessive, is Always Within the Rule of Faith.</head>
<p>As for us, although we must still seek, and that always, yet where ought our search to
be made? Amongst the heretics, where all things are foreign1989 and opposed to our own
verity, and to whom we are forbidden to draw near? What slave looks for food from a
stranger, not to say an enemy of his master? What soldier expects to get bounty and pay
from kings who are unallied, I might almost say hostile—unless forsooth he be a deserter,
and a runaway, and a rebel? Even that old woman1990 searched for the piece of silver within
her own house. It was also at his neighbour’s door that the persevering assailant kept
knocking. Nor was it to a hostile judge, although a severe one, that the widow made her
appeal. No man gets instruction1991 from that which tends to destruction.1992 No man receives
illumination from a quarter where all is darkness. Let our “seeking,” therefore be in
that which is our own, and from those who are our own: and concerning that which is our
own,—that, and only that,1993 which can become an object of inquiry without impairing
the rule of faith.</p>

of Christ’s Teaching.</head>
<p>Now, with regard to this rule of faith—that we may from this point1994 acknowledge
what it is which we defend—it is, you must know, that which prescribes the belief that there
is one only God, and that He is none other than the Creator of the world, who produced all
things out of nothing through His own Word, first of all sent forth;1995 that this Word is
called His Son, and, under the name of God, was seen “in diverse manners” by the patriarchs,
heard at all times in the prophets, at last brought down by the Spirit and Power of the
Father into the Virgin Mary, was made flesh in her womb, and, being born of her, went
forth as Jesus Christ; thenceforth He preached the new law and the new promise of the
kingdom of heaven, worked miracles; having been crucified, He rose again the third day;
(then) having ascended1996 into the heavens, He sat at the right hand of the Father; sent
instead of Himself1997 the Power of the Holy Ghost to lead such as believe; will come with
glory to take the saints to the enjoyment of everlasting life and of the heavenly promises,
and to condemn the wicked to everlasting fire, after the resurrection of both these classes
shall have happened, together with the restoration of their flesh. This rule, as it will be
proved, was taught by Christ, and raises amongst ourselves no other questions than those
which heresies introduce, and which make men heretics.1998</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—Curiosity Ought Not Range Beyond the Rule of Faith. Restless
Curiosity, the Feature of Heresy.</head>
<p>So long, however, as its form exists in its proper order, you may seek and discuss as
much as you please, and give full rein to1999 your curiosity, in whatever seems to you to
hang in doubt, or to be shrouded in obscurity. You have at hand, no doubt, some learned2000
brother gifted with the grace of knowledge, some one of the experienced class, some one of
your close acquaintance who is curious like yourself; although with yourself, a seeker he
will, after all,2001 be quite aware2002 that it is better for you to remain in ignorance, lest you
should come to know what you ought not, because you have acquired the knowledge of
what you ought to know.2003 “Thy faith,” He says, “hath saved thee”2004 not observe your
skill2005 in the Scriptures. Now, faith has been deposited in the rule; it has a law, and (in the
observance thereof) salvation. Skill,2006 however, consists in curious art, having for its glory
simply the readiness that comes from knack.2007 Let such curious art give place to faith; let
such glory yield to salvation. At any rate, let them either relinquish their noisiness,2008 or
else be quiet. To know nothing in opposition to the rule (of faith), is to know all things.
(Suppose) that heretics were not enemies to the truth, so that we were not forewarned to
avoid them, what sort of conduct would it be to agree with men who do themselves confess
that they are still seeking? For if they are still seeking, they have not as yet found anything
amounting to certainty; and therefore, whatever they seem for a while2009 to hold, they betray
their own scepticism,2010 whilst they continue seeking. You therefore, who seek after their

fashion, looking to those who are themselves ever seeking, a doubter to doubters, a waverer
to waverers, must needs be “led, blindly by the blind, down into the ditch.”2011 But when,
for the sake of deceiving us, they pretend that they are still seeking, in order that they may
palm2012 their essays2013 upon us by the suggestion of an anxious sympathy,2014—when,
in short (after gaining an access to us), they proceed at once to insist on the necessity of our
inquiring into such points as they were in the habit of advancing, then it is high time for us
in moral obligation2015 to repel2016 them, so that they may know that it is not Christ, but
themselves, whom we disavow. For since they are still seekers, they have no fixed tenets
yet;2017 and being not fixed in tenet, they have not yet believed; and being not yet believers,
they are not Christians. But even though they have their tenets and their belief, they still say
that inquiry is necessary in order to discussion.2018 Previous, however, to the discussion,
they deny what they confess not yet to have believed, so long as they keep it an object of
inquiry. When men, therefore, are not Christians even on their own admission,2019 how
much more (do they fail to appear such) to us! What sort of truth is that which they patronize,
2020 when they commend it to us with a lie? Well, but they actually2021 treat of the
Scriptures and recommend (their opinions) out of the Scriptures! To be sure they do.2022
From what other source could they derive arguments concerning the things of the faith,
except from the records of the faith?</p>

and dismiss waverers with a doubt. Accordingly, we oppose to them this step above all
others, of not admitting them to any discussion of the Scriptures.2026</p>

to enter on “questions,” or to lend our ears to new-fangled statements,2030 or to consort
with a heretic “after the first and second admonition,”2031 not, (be it observed,) after discussion.
Discussion he has inhibited in this way, by designating admonition as the purpose of
dealing with a heretic, and the first one too, because he is not a Christian; in order that he
might not, after the manner of a Christian, seem to require correction again and again, and
“before two or three witnesses,”2032 seeing that he ought to be corrected, for the very reason
that he is not to be disputed with; and in the next place, because a controversy over the
Scriptures can, clearly,2033 produce no other effect than help to upset either the stomach or

the contrivance of diverse interpretations. Truth is just as much opposed by an adulteration
of its meaning as it is by a corruption of its text.2036 Their vain presumptions must needs
refuse to acknowledge the (writings) whereby they are refuted. They rely on those which
they have falsely put together, and which they have selected, because of2037 their ambiguity.
Though most skilled2038 in the Scriptures, you will make no progress,2039 when everything

<head>Chapter XX.—Christ First Delivered the Faith. The Apostles Spread It; They FoundedChurches as the Depositories Thereof. That Faith, Therefore, is Apostolic, Which Descended from the Apostles, Through Apostolic Churches.</head>
<p>Christ Jesus our Lord (may He bear with me a moment in thus expressing myself!),
whosoever He is, of what God soever He is the Son, of what substance soever He is man and
God, of what faith soever He is the teacher, of what reward soever He is the Promiser, did,
whilst He lived on earth, Himself declare what He was, what He had been, what the Father’s
will was which He was administering, what the duty of man was which He was prescribing;
(and this declaration He made,) either openly to the people, or privately to His disciples, of
whom He had chosen the twelve chief ones to be at His side,2051 and whom He destined to
be the teachers of the nations. Accordingly, after one of these had been struck off, He commanded
the eleven others, on His departure to the Father, to “go and teach all nations, who
were to be baptized into the Father, and into the Son, and into the Holy Ghost.”2052 Immediately,
therefore, so did the apostles, whom this designation indicates as “the sent.” Having,
on the authority of a prophecy, which occurs in a psalm of David,2053 chosen Matthias by
lot as the twelfth, into the place of Judas, they obtained the promised power of the Holy
Ghost for the gift of miracles and of utterance; and after first bearing witness to the faith in
Jesus Christ throughout Judæa, and founding churches (there), they next went forth into
the world and preached the same doctrine of the same faith to the nations. They then in like
manner founded churches in every city, from which all the other churches, one after another,
derived the tradition of the faith,2054 and the seeds of doctrine, and are every day deriving
them,2055 that they may become churches. Indeed, it is on this account only that they will
be able to deem themselves apostolic, as being the offspring of apostolic churches. Every
sort of thing2056 must necessarily revert to its original for its classification.2057 Therefore
the churches, although they are so many and so great, comprise but the one primitive church,
(founded) by the apostles, from which they all (spring). In this way all are primitive, and
all are apostolic, whilst they are all proved to be one, in (unbroken) unity, by their peaceful

<head>Chapter XXI.—All Doctrine True Which Comes Through the Church from the
Apostles, Who Were Taught by God Through Christ. All Opinion Which Has
No Such Divine Origin and Apostolic Tradition to Show, is Ipso Facto False.</head>
<p>From this, therefore, do we draw up our rule. Since the Lord Jesus Christ sent the apostles
to preach, (our rule is) that no others ought to be received as preachers than those whom
Christ appointed; for “no man knoweth the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the
Son will reveal Him.”2062 Nor does the Son seem to have revealed Him to any other than
the apostles, whom He sent forth to preach—that, of course, which He revealed to them.
Now, what that was which they preached—in other words, what it was which Christ revealed
to them—can, as I must here likewise prescribe, properly be proved in no other way than
by those very churches which the apostles founded in person, by declaring the gospel to
them directly themselves, both vivâ voce, as the phrase is, and subsequently by their epistles.
If, then, these things are so, it is in the same degree2063 manifest that all doctrine which
agrees with the apostolic churches—those moulds2064 and original sources of the faith must
be reckoned for truth, as undoubtedly containing that which the (said) churches received
from the apostles, the apostles from Christ, Christ from God. Whereas all doctrine must
be prejudged2065 as false2066 which savours of contrariety to the truth of the churches and
apostles of Christ and God. It remains, then, that we demonstrate whether this doctrine of
ours, of which we have now given the rule, has its origin2067 in the tradition of the apostles,
and whether all other doctrines do not ipso facto2068proceed from falsehood. We hold
communion with the apostolic churches because our doctrine is in no respect different from
theirs. This is our witness of truth.</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—Attempt to Invalidate This Rule of Faith Rebutted. The Apostles
Safe Transmitters of the Truth. Sufficiently Taught at First, and Faithful in the
Transmission.</head>
<p>But inasmuch as the proof is so near at hand,2069 that if it were at once produced there
would be nothing left to be dealt with, let us give way for a while to the opposite side, if they
think that they can find some means of invalidating this rule, just as if no proof were forthcoming
from us. They usually tell us that the apostles did not know all things: (but herein)
they are impelled by the same madness, whereby they turn round to the very opposite
point,2070 and declare that the apostles certainly knew all things, but did not deliver all
things to all persons,—in either case exposing Christ to blame for having sent forth apostles
who had either too much ignorance, or too little simplicity. What man, then, of sound mind
can possibly suppose that they were ignorant of anything, whom the Lord ordained to be
masters (or teachers),2071 keeping them, as He did, inseparable (from Himself) in their attendance,
in their discipleship, in their society, to whom, “when they were alone, He used
to expound” all things2072 which were obscure, telling them that “to them it was given to
know those mysteries,”2073 which it was not permitted the people to understand? Was
anything withheld from the knowledge of Peter, who is called “the rock on which the church
should be built,”2074 who also obtained “the keys of the kingdom of heaven,”2075 with the

ignorant to whom, after His resurrection also, He vouchsafed, as they were journeying together,
“to expound all the Scriptures.”2084 No doubt2085 He had once said, “I have yet many
things to say unto you, but ye cannot hear them now;” but even then He added, “When He,
the Spirit of truth, shall come, He will lead you into all truth.”2086 He (thus) shows that there
was nothing of which they were ignorant, to whom He had promised the future attainment
of all truth by help of the Spirit of truth. And assuredly He fulfilled His promise, since it is
proved in the Acts of the Apostles that the Holy Ghost did come down. Now they who reject
that Scripture2087 can neither belong to the Holy Spirit, seeing that they cannot acknowledge
that the Holy Ghost has been sent as yet to the disciples, nor can they presume to claim to

<head>Chapter XXIII.—The Apostles Not Ignorant. The Heretical Pretence of St. Peter’s Imperfection Because He Was Rebuked by St. Paul. St. Peter Not Rebuked for
Error in Teaching.</head>
<p>Now, with the view of branding2091 the apostles with some mark of ignorance, they put
forth the case of Peter and them that were with him having been rebuked by Paul. “Something
therefore,” they say, “was wanting in them.” (This they allege,) in order that they may from
this construct that other position of theirs, that a fuller knowledge may possibly have afterwards
come over (the apostles,) such as fell to the share of Paul when he rebuked those who
preceded him. I may here say to those who reject The Acts of the Apostles: “It is first necessary
that you show us who this Paul was,—both what he was before he was an apostle, and how
he became an apostle,”—so very great is the use which they make of him in respect of other
questions also. It is true that he tells us himself that he was a persecutor before he became
an apostle,2092 still this is not enough for any man who examines before he believes, since
even the Lord Himself did not bear witness of Himself.2093 But let them believe without the
Scriptures, if their object is to believe contrary to the Scriptures.2094 Still they should show,
from the circumstance which they allege of Peter’s being rebuked by Paul, that Paul added
yet another form of the gospel besides that which Peter and the rest had previously set forth.
But the fact is,2095 having been converted from a persecutor to a preacher, he is introduced
as one of the brethren to brethren, by brethren—to them, indeed, by men who had put on
faith from the apostles’ hands. Afterwards, as he himself narrates, he “went up to Jerusalem
for the purpose of seeing Peter,”2096 because of his office, no doubt,2097 and by right of a
common belief and preaching. Now they certainly would not have been surprised at his
having become a preacher instead of a persecutor, if his preaching were of something contrary;
nor, moreover, would they have “glorified the Lord,”2098 because Paul had presented
himself as an adversary to Him. They accordingly even gave him “the right hand of fellowship,”
2099 as a sign of their agreement with him, and arranged amongst themselves a distribution
of office, not a diversity of gospel, so that they should severally preach not a different

gospel, but (the same), to different persons,2100 Peter to the circumcision, Paul to the Gentiles.
Forasmuch, then, as Peter was rebuked because, after he had lived with the Gentiles, he
proceeded to separate himself from their company out of respect for persons, the fault surely
was one of conversation, not of preaching.2101 For it does not appear from this, that any
other God than the Creator, or any other Christ than (the son) of Mary, or any other hope
than the resurrection, was (by him) announced.</p>

to Add to the Faith. Heretics Boast as If Favoured with Some of the Secrets Imparted to Him.</head>
<p>I have not the good fortune,2102 or, as I must rather say,2103 I have not the unenviable
task,2104 of setting apostles by the ears.2105 But, inasmuch as our very perverse cavillers
obtrude the rebuke in question for the set purpose of bringing the earlier2106 doctrine into
suspicion, I will put in a defence, as it were, for Peter, to the effect that even Paul said that
he was “made all things to all men—to the Jews a Jew,” to those who were not Jews as one
who was not a Jew—“that he might gain all.”2107 Therefore it was according to times and
persons and causes that they used to censure certain practices, which they would not hesitate
themselves to pursue, in like conformity to times and persons and causes. Just (e.g.) as if
Peter too had censured Paul, because, whilst forbidding circumcision, he actually circumcised
Timothy himself. Never mind2108 those who pass sentence on apostles! It is a happy fact
that Peter is on the same level with Paul in the very glory2109 of martyrdom. Now, although
Paul was carried away even to the third heaven, and was caught up to paradise,2110 and
heard certain revelations there, yet these cannot possibly seem to have qualified him for
(teaching) another doctrine, seeing that their very nature was such as to render them communicable
to no human being.2111 If, however, that unspeakable mystery2112 did leak
out,2113 and become known to any man, and if any heresy affirms that it does itself follow
the same, (then) either Paul must be charged with having betrayed the secret, or some other
man must actually2114 be shown to have been afterwards “caught up into paradise,” who
had permission to speak out plainly what Paul was not allowed (even) to mutter.</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—The Apostles Did Not Keep Back Any of the Deposit of Doctrine
Which Christ Had Entrusted to Them. St. Paul Openly Committed His Whole
Doctrine to Timothy.</head>
<p>But here is, as we have said,2115 the same madness, in their allowing indeed that the
apostles were ignorant of nothing, and preached not any (doctrines) which contradicted
one another, but at the same time insisting that they did not reveal all to all men, for that
they proclaimed some openly and to all the world, whilst they disclosed others (only) in
secret and to a few, because Paul addressed even this expression to Timothy: “O Timothy,
guard that which is entrusted to thee;”2116 and again: “That good thing which was committed
unto thee keep.”2117 What is this deposit? Is it so secret as to be supposed to characterize2118
a new doctrine? or is it a part of that charge of which he says, “This charge I commit unto
thee, son Timothy?”2119 and also of that precept of which he says, “I charge thee in the sight
of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Jesus Christ who witnessed a good confession
under Pontius Pilate, that thou keep this commandment?”2120 Now, what is (this) commandment
and what is (this) charge? From the preceding and the succeeding contexts, it will be
manifest that there is no mysterious2121 hint darkly suggested in this expression about
(some) far-fetched2122 doctrine, but that a warning is rather given against receiving any
other (doctrine) than that which Timothy had heard from himself, as I take it publicly:
“Before many witnesses” is his phrase.2123 Now, if they refuse to allow that the church is
meant by these “many witnesses,” it matters nothing, since nothing could have been secret
which was produced “before many witnesses.” Nor, again, must the circumstance of his
having wished him to “commit these things to faithful men, who should be able to teach
others also,”2124 be construed into a proof of there being some occult gospel. For, when he
says “these things,” he refers to the things of which he is writing at the moment. In reference,

<head>Chapter XXVI.—The Apostles Did in All Cases Teach the Whole Truth to the Whole Church. No Reservation, Nor Partial Communication to Favourite Friends.</head>
<p>Besides which, it must have followed, that, for the man to whom he committed the
ministration of the gospel, he would add the injunction that it be not ministered in all
places,2126 and without respect to persons,2127 in accordance with the Lord’s saying, “Not
to cast one’s pearls before swine, nor that which is holy unto dogs.”2128 Openly did the Lord
speak,2129 without any intimation of a hidden mystery. He had Himself commanded that,
“whatsoever they had heard in darkness” and in secret, they should “declare in the light and
on the house-tops.”2130 He had Himself foreshown, by means of a parable, that they should
not keep back in secret, fruitless of interest,2131 a single pound, that is, one word of His.
He used Himself to tell them that a candle was not usually “pushed away under a bushel,
but placed on a candlestick,” in order to “give light to all who are in the house.”2132 These
things the apostles either neglected, or failed to understand, if they fulfilled them not, by
concealing any portion of the light, that is, of the word of God and the mystery of Christ.
Of no man, I am quite sure, were they afraid,—neither of Jews nor of Gentiles in their violence;
2133 with all the greater freedom, then, would they certainly preach in the church, who
held not their tongue in synagogues and public places. Indeed they would have found it
impossible either to convert Jews or to bring in Gentiles, unless they “set forth in order”2134
that which they would have them believe. Much less, when churches were advanced in the
faith, would they have withdrawn from them anything for the purpose of committing it
separately to some few others. Although, even supposing that among intimate friends,2135
so to speak, they did hold certain discussions, yet it is incredible that these could have been
such as to bring in some other rule of faith, differing from and contrary to that which they
were proclaiming through the Catholic churches,2136—as if they spoke of one God in the

<p>Since, therefore, it is incredible that the apostles were either ignorant of the whole scope
of the message which they had to declare,2139 or failed to make known to all men the entire
rule of faith, let us see whether, while the apostles proclaimed it, perhaps, simply and fully,
the churches, through their own fault, set it forth otherwise than the apostles had done. All
these suggestions of distrust2140 you may find put forward by the heretics. They bear in
mind how the churches were rebuked by the apostle: “O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched
you?”2141 and, “Ye did run so well; who hath hindered you?”2142 and how the epistle
actually begins: “I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him, who hath called you as
His own in grace, to another gospel.”2143 That they likewise (remember), what was written
to the Corinthians, that they “were yet carnal,” who “required to be fed with milk,” being
as yet “unable to bear strong meat;”2144 who also “thought that they knew somewhat,
whereas they knew not yet anything, as they ought to know.”2145 When they raise the objection
that the churches were rebuked, let them suppose that they were also corrected; let
them also remember those (churches), concerning whose faith and knowledge and conversation
the apostle “rejoices and gives thanks to God,” which nevertheless even at this day,
unite with those which were rebuked in the privileges of one and the same institution.</p>

teacher of truth;2147 grant, also, that He, the Steward of God, the Vicar of Christ,2148 neglected
His office, permitting the churches for a time to understand differently, (and) to believe
differently, what He Himself was preaching by the apostles,—is it likely that so many
churches, and they so great, should have gone astray into one and the same faith? No casualty
distributed among many men issues in one and the same result. Error of doctrine in the
churches must necessarily have produced various issues. When, however, that which is

Truth.</head>
<p>In whatever manner error came, it reigned of course2150 only as long as there was an
absence of heresies? Truth had to wait for certain Marcionites and Valentinians to set it
free. During the interval the gospel was wrongly2151 preached; men wrongly believed; so
many thousands were wrongly baptized; so many works of faith were wrongly wrought; so
many miraculous gifts,2152 so many spiritual endowments,2153 were wrongly set in operation;
so many priestly functions, so many ministries,2154 were wrongly executed; and, to sum up
the whole, so many martyrs wrongly received their crowns! Else, if not wrongly done, and
to no purpose, how comes it to pass that the things of God were on their course before it
was known to what God they belonged? that there were Christians before Christ was found?
that there were heresies before true doctrine? Not so; for in all cases truth precedes its copy,
the likeness succeeds the reality. Absurd enough, however, is it, that heresy should be deemed
to have preceded its own prior doctrine, even on this account, because it is that (doctrine)
itself which foretold that there should be heresies against which men would have to guard!
To a church which possessed this doctrine, it was written—yea, the doctrine itself writes to
its own church—“Though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel than that which
we have preached, let him be accursed.”2155</p>

Valentinus; Nigidius, and Hermogenes.</head>
<p>Where was Marcion then, that shipmaster of Pontus, the zealous student of Stoicism?
Where was Valentinus then, the disciple of Platonism? For it is evident that those men lived
not so long ago,—in the reign of Antoninus for the most part,2156—and that they at first
were believers in the doctrine of the Catholic Church, in the church of Rome under the
episcopate of the blessed Eleutherus,2157 until on account of their ever restless curiosity,
with which they even infected the brethren, they were more than once expelled. Marcion,
indeed, [went] with the two hundred sesterces which he had brought into the church,
and,2158 when banished at last to a permanent excommunication, they scattered abroad the
poisons of their doctrines. Afterwards, it is true, Marcion professed repentance, and agreed
to the conditions granted to him—that he should receive reconciliation if he restored to the
church all the others whom he had been training for perdition: he was prevented, however,
by death. It was indeed2159 necessary that there should be heresies;2160 and yet it does not
follow from that necessity, that heresies are a good thing. As if it has not been necessary also
that there should be evil! It was even necessary that the Lord should be betrayed; but woe
to the traitor!2161 So that no man may from this defend heresies. If we must likewise touch
the descent2162 of Apelles, he is far from being “one of the old school,”2163 like his instructor
and moulder, Marcion; he rather forsook the continence of Marcion, by resorting to the
company of a woman, and withdrew to Alexandria, out of sight of his most abstemious2164
master. Returning therefrom, after some years, unimproved, except that he was no longer
a Marcionite, he clave2165 to another woman, the maiden Philumene (whom we have

been imposed on by her vigorous spirit,2167 he committed to writing the revelations which
he had learned of her. Persons are still living who remember them,—their own actual disciples
and successors,—who cannot therefore deny the lateness of their date. But, in fact, by their
own works they are convicted, even as the Lord said.2168 For since Marcion separated the
New Testament from the Old, he is (necessarily) subsequent to that which he separated,
inasmuch as it was only in his power to separate what was (previously) united. Having then
been united previous to its separation, the fact of its subsequent separation proves the subsequence
also of the man who effected the separation. In like manner Valentinus, by his
different expositions and acknowledged2169 emendations, makes these changes on the express
ground of previous faultiness, and therefore demonstrates the difference2170 of the documents.
These corrupters of the truth we mention as being more notorious and more public2171
than others. There is, however, a certain man2172 named Nigidius, and Hermogenes,
and several others, who still pursue the course2173 of perverting the ways of the Lord. Let
them show me by what authority they come! If it be some other God they preach, how
comes it that they employ the things and the writings and the names of that God against
whom they preach? If it be the same God, why treat Him in some other way? Let them prove
themselves to be new apostles!2174 Let them maintain that Christ has come down a second
time, taught in person a second time, has been twice crucified, twice dead, twice raised! For
thus has the apostle described (the order of events in the life of Christ); for thus, too, is
He2175 accustomed to make His apostles—to give them, (that is), power besides of working
the same miracles which He worked Himself.2176 I would therefore have their mighty deeds

<p>Let me return, however, from this digression2177 to discuss2178 the priority of truth,
and the comparative lateness2179 of falsehood, deriving support for my argument even from
that parable which puts in the first place the sowing by the Lord of the good seed of the
wheat, but introduces at a later stage the adulteration of the crop by its enemy the devil with
the useless weed of the wild oats. For herein is figuratively described the difference of doctrines,
since in other passages also the word of God is likened unto seed. From the actual
order, therefore, it becomes clear, that that which was first delivered is of the Lord and is
true, whilst that is strange and false which was afterwards introduced. This sentence will
keep its ground in opposition to all later heresies, which have no consistent quality of kindred
knowledge2180 inherent in them—to claim the truth as on their side.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXII.—None of the Heretics Claim Succession from the Apostles. New
Churches Still Apostolic, Because Their Faith is that Which the Apostles Taught
and Handed Down. The Heretics Challenged to Show Any Apostolic Credentials.</head>
<p>But if there be any (heresies) which are bold enough to plant themselves in the midst
of the apostolic age, that they may thereby seem to have been handed down by the apostles,
because they existed in the time of the apostles, we can say: Let them produce the original
records2181 of their churches; let them unfold the roll of their bishops, running down in
due succession from the beginning in such a manner that [that first bishop of theirs2182]
bishop shall be able to show for his ordainer and predecessor some one of the apostles or
of apostolic men,—a man, moreover, who continued stedfast with the apostles. For this is
the manner in which the apostolic churches transmit2183 their registers:2184 as the church
of Smyrna, which records that Polycarp was placed therein by John; as also the church of
Rome, which makes Clement to have been ordained in like manner by Peter.2185 In exactly
the same way the other churches likewise exhibit (their several worthies), whom, as having
been appointed to their episcopal places by apostles, they regard as transmitters of the
apostolic seed. Let the heretics contrive2186 something of the same kind. For after their
blasphemy, what is there that is unlawful for them (to attempt)? But should they even effect
the contrivance, they will not advance a step. For their very doctrine, after comparison with
that of the apostles, will declare, by its own diversity and contrariety, that it had for its author
neither an apostle nor an apostolic man; because, as the apostles would never have taught
things which were self-contradictory, so the apostolic men would not have inculcated
teaching different from the apostles, unless they who received their instruction from the
apostles went and preached in a contrary manner. To this test, therefore will they be submitted
for proof2187 by those churches, who, although they derive not their founder from
apostles or apostolic men (as being of much later date, for they are in fact being founded
daily), yet, since they agree in the same faith, they are accounted as not less apostolic because

But in truth they neither are so, nor are they able to prove themselves to be what they are
not. Nor are they admitted to peaceful relations and communion by such churches as are
in any way connected with apostles, inasmuch as they are in no sense themselves apostolic
because of their diversity as to the mysteries of the faith.2190</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIII.—Present Heresies (Seedlings of the Tares Noted by the Sacred
Writers) Already Condemned in Scripture. This Descent of Later Heresy from
the Earlier Traced in Several Instances.</head>
<p>Besides all this, I add a review of the doctrines themselves, which, existing as they did
in the days of the apostles, were both exposed and denounced by the said apostles. For by
this method they will be more easily reprobated,2191 when they are detected to have been
even then in existence, or at any rate to have been seedlings2192 of the (tares) which then
were. Paul, in his first epistle to the Corinthians, sets his mark on certain who denied and
doubted the resurrection.2193 This opinion was the especial property of the Sadducees.2194
A part of it, however, is maintained by Marcion and Apelles and Valentinus, and all other
impugners of the resurrection. Writing also to the Galatians, he inveighs against such men
as observed and defend circumcision and the (Mosaic) law.2195 Thus runs Hebion’s heresy.
Such also as “forbid to marry” he reproaches in his instructions to Timothy.2196 Now, this
is the teaching of Marcion and his follower Apelles. (The apostle) directs a similar blow2197
against those who said that “the resurrection was past already.”2198 Such an opinion did the
Valentinians assert of themselves. When again he mentions “endless genealogies,”2199 one
also recognises Valentinus, in whose system a certain Æon, whosoever he be,2200 of a new
name, and that not one only, generates of his own grace2201 Sense and Truth; and these in
like manner produce of themselves Word2202 and Life, while these again afterwards beget
Man and the Church. From these primary eight2203 ten other Æons after them spring, and
then the twelve others arise with their wonderful names, to complete the mere story of the
thirty Æons. The same apostle, when disapproving of those who are “in bondage to elements,”
2204 points us to some dogma of Hermogenes, who introduces matter as having no

the mother of the elements a goddess, he has it in his power “to be in bondage” to a being

those “who eat things sacrificed to idols,” and “who commit fornication.”2208 There are
even now another sort of Nicolaitans. Theirs is called the Gaian2209 heresy. But in his epistle
he especially designates those as “Antichrists” who “denied that Christ was come in the

<head>Chapter XXXIV.—No Early Controversy Respecting the Divine Creator; No Second
God Introduced at First. Heresies Condemned Alike by the Sentence and the
Silence of Holy Scripture.</head>
<p>These are, as I suppose, the different kinds of spurious doctrines, which (as we are informed
by the apostles themselves) existed in their own day. And yet we find amongst so
many various perversions of truth, not one school2213 which raised any controversy concerning
God as the Creator of all things. No man was bold enough to surmise a second god.
More readily was doubt felt about the Son than about the Father, until Marcion introduced,
in addition to the Creator, another god of goodness only. Apelles made the Creator of some
nondescript2214 glorious angel, who belonged to the superior God, the god (according to
him,) of the law and of Israel, affirming that he was fire.2215 Valentinus disseminated his
Æons, and traced the sin of one Æon2216 to the production of God the Creator. To none,
forsooth, except these, nor prior to these, was revealed the truth of the Divine Nature; and
they obtained this especial honour and fuller favour from the devil, we cannot doubt,2217
because he wished even in this respect to rival God, that he might succeed, by the poison of
his doctrines, in doing himself what the Lord said could not be done—making “the disciples
above their Master.”2218 Let the entire mass2219 of heresies choose, therefore, for themselves
the times when they should appear, provided that the when be an unimportant point; allowing,
too, that they be not of the truth, and (as a matter of course2220) that such as had no
existence in the time of the apostles could not possibly have had any connection with the
apostles. If indeed they had then existed, their names would be extant,2221 with a view to
their own repression likewise. Those (heresies) indeed which did exist in the days of the
apostles, are condemned in their very mention.2222 If it be true, then, that those heresies,
which in the apostolic times were in a rude form, are now found to be the same, only in a
much more polished shape, they derive their condemnation from this very circumstance.

on their part also advance similar rules to these against our doctrine, whether they be later
than the apostles or contemporary with the apostles, provided they be different from them;
provided also they were, by either a general or a specific censure, precondemned by them.
For since they deny the truth of (our doctrine), they ought to prove that it also is heresy,
refutable by the same rule as that by which they are themselves refuted; and at the same
time to show us where we must seek the truth, which it is by this time evident has no existence
amongst them. Our system2228 is not behind any in date; on the contrary, it is earlier than
all; and this fact will be the evidence of that truth which everywhere occupies the first place.
The apostles, again, nowhere condemn it; they rather defend it,—a fact which will show that
it comes from themselves.2229 For that doctrine which they refrain from condemning, when
they have condemned every strange opinion, they show to be their own, and on that ground

business of your salvation, run over the apostolic churches, in which the very thrones2230
of the apostles are still pre-eminent in their places,2231 in which their own authentic writings2232
are read, uttering the voice and representing the face of each of them severally.
Achaia is very near you, (in which) you find Corinth. Since you are not far from Macedonia,
you have Philippi; (and there too) you have the Thessalonians. Since you are able to cross
to Asia, you get Ephesus. Since, moreover, you are close upon Italy,2233 you have Rome,
from which there comes even into our own hands the very authority (of apostles themselves).
2234 How happy is its church, on which apostles poured forth all their doctrine along
with their blood! where Peter endures a passion like his Lord’s! where Paul wins his crown
in a death like John’s2235 where the Apostle John was first plunged, unhurt, into boiling oil,
and thence remitted to his island-exile! See what she has learned, what taught, what fellowship
has had with even (our) churches in Africa!2236 One Lord God does she acknowledge, the
Creator of the universe, and Christ Jesus (born) of the Virgin Mary, the Son of God the
Creator; and the Resurrection of the flesh; the law and the prophets she unites2237 in one
volume with the writings of evangelists and apostles, from which she drinks in her faith.
This she seals with the water (of baptism), arrays with the Holy Ghost, feeds with the

<p>Since this is the case, in order that the truth may be adjudged to belong to us, “as many
as walk according to the rule,” which the church has handed down from the apostles, the
apostles from Christ, and Christ from God, the reason of our position is clear, when it determines
that heretics ought not to be allowed to challenge an appeal to the Scriptures, since
we, without the Scriptures, prove that they have nothing to do with the Scriptures. For as
they are heretics, they cannot be true Christians, because it is not from Christ that they get
that which they pursue of their own mere choice, and from the pursuit incur and admit the
name of heretics.2247 Thus, not being Christians, they have acquired2248 no right to the
Christian Scriptures; and it may be very fairly said to them, “Who are you? When and whence
did you come? As you are none of mine, what have you to do with that which is mine? Indeed,
Marcion, by what right do you hew my wood? By whose permission, Valentinus, are you
diverting the streams of my fountain? By what power, Apelles, are you removing my landmarks?
This is my property. Why are you, the rest, sowing and feeding here at your own
pleasure? This (I say) is my property. I have long possessed it; I possessed it before you. I
hold sure title-deeds from the original owners themselves, to whom the estate belonged. I
am the heir of the apostles. Just as they carefully prepared their will and testament, and
committed it to a trust, and adjured (the trustees to be faithful to their charge),2249 even so
do I hold it. As for you, they have, it is certain, always held you as disinherited, and rejected
you as strangers—as enemies. But on what ground are heretics strangers and enemies to
the apostles, if it be not from the difference of their teaching, which each individual of his
own mere will has either advanced or received in opposition to the apostles?”</p>

Never Change the Scriptures, Which Always Testify for Them.</head>
<p>Where diversity of doctrine is found, there, then, must the corruption both of the
Scriptures and the expositions thereof be regarded as existing. On those whose purpose it
was to teach differently, lay the necessity of differently arranging the instruments of doctrine.
2250 They could not possibly have effected their diversity of teaching in any other way
than by having a difference in the means whereby they taught. As in their case, corruption
in doctrine could not possibly have succeeded without a corruption also of its instruments,
so to ourselves also integrity of doctrine could not have accrued, without integrity in those
means by which doctrine is managed. Now, what is there in our Scriptures which is contrary
to us?2251 What of our own have we introduced, that we should have to take it away again,
or else add to it, or alter it, in order to restore to its natural soundness anything which is
contrary to it, and contained in the Scriptures?2252 What we are ourselves, that also the
Scriptures are (and have been) from the beginning.2253 Of them we have our being, before
there was any other way, before they were interpolated by you. Now, inasmuch as all interpolation
must be believed to be a later process, for the express reason that it proceeds from
rivalry which is never in any case previous to nor home-born2254 with that which it emulates,
it is as incredible to every man of sense that we should seem to have introduced any corrupt
text into the Scriptures, existing, as we have been, from the very first, and being the first, as
it is that they have not in fact introduced it who are both later in date and opposed (to the
Scriptures). One man perverts the Scriptures with his hand, another their meaning by his
exposition. For although Valentinus seems to use the entire volume,2255 he has none the
less laid violent hands on the truth only with a more cunning mind and skill2256 than Marcion.
Marcion expressly and openly used the knife, not the pen, since he made such an excision

<p>These were the ingenious arts of “spiritual wickednesses,”2259 wherewith we also, my
brethren, may fairly expect to have “to wrestle,” as necessary for faith, that the elect may be
made manifest, (and) that the reprobate may be discovered. And therefore they possess influence,
and a facility in thinking out and fabricating2260 errors, which ought not to be
wondered at as if it were a difficult and inexplicable process, seeing that in profane writings
also an example comes ready to hand of a similar facility. You see in our own day, composed
out of Virgil,2261 a story of a wholly different character, the subject-matter being arranged
according to the verse, and the verse according to the subject-matter. In short,2262 Hosidius
Geta has most completely pilfered his tragedy of Medea from Virgil. A near relative of my
own, among some leisure productions2263 of his pen, has composed out of the same poet
The Table of Cebes. On the same principle, those poetasters are commonly called Homerocentones,
“collectors of Homeric odds and ends,” who stitch into one piece, patchwork
fashion, works of their own from the lines of Homer, out of many scraps put together from
this passage and from that (in miscellaneous confusion). Now, unquestionably, the Divine
Scriptures are more fruitful in resources of all kinds for this sort of facility. Nor do I risk
contradiction in saying2264 that the very Scriptures were even arranged by the will of God
in such a manner as to furnish materials for heretics, inasmuch as I read that “there must
be heresies,”2265 which there cannot be without the Scriptures.</p>

<head>Chapter XL.—No Difference in the Spirit of Idolatry and of Heresy. In the Rites of
Idolatry, Satan Imitated and Distorted the Divine Institutions of the Older
Scriptures. The Christian Scriptures Corrupted by Him in the Perversions of the
Various Heretics.</head>
<p>The question will arise, By whom is to be interpreted2266 the sense of the passages which
make for heresies? By the devil, of course, to whom pertain those wiles which pervert the
truth, and who, by the mystic rites of his idols, vies even with the essential portions2267 of
the sacraments of God.2268 He, too, baptizes some—that is, his own believers and faithful
followers;2269 he promises the putting away2270 of sins by a laver (of his own); and if my
memory still serves me, Mithra there, (in the kingdom of Satan,) sets his marks on the
foreheads of his soldiers; celebrates also the oblation of bread, and introduces an image of
a resurrection, and before a sword wreathes a crown.2271 What also must we say to (Satan’s)
limiting his chief priest2272 to a single marriage? He, too, has his virgins; he, too, has his
proficients in continence.2273 Suppose now we revolve in our minds the superstitions of
Numa Pompilius, and consider his priestly offices and badges and privileges, his sacrificial
services, too, and the instruments and vessels of the sacrifices themselves, and the curious
rites of his expiations and vows: is it not clear to us that the devil imitated the well-known2274
moroseness of the Jewish law? Since, therefore he has shown such emulation in his great
aim of expressing, in the concerns of his idolatry, those very things of which consists the
administration of Christ’s sacraments, it follows, of course, that the same being, possessing
still the same genius, both set his heart upon,2275 and succeeded in, adapting2276 to his

“spiritual wickednesses,” from which also heresies come, have been introduced by the devil,
or that there is any real difference between heresies and idolatry, seeing that they appertain
both to the same author and the same work that idolatry does. They either pretend that
there is another god in opposition to the Creator, or, even if they acknowledge that the
Creator is the one only God, they treat of Him as a different being from what He is in truth.

<head>Chapter XLI.—The Conduct of Heretics: Its Frivolity, Worldliness, and Irregularity.
The Notorious Wantonness of Their Women.</head>
<p>I must not omit an account of the conduct2278 also of the heretics—how frivolous it is,
how worldly, how merely human, without seriousness, without authority, without discipline,
as suits their creed. To begin with, it is doubtful who is a catechumen, and who a believer;
they have all access alike, they hear alike, they pray alike—even heathens, if any such happen
to come among them. “That which is holy they will cast to the dogs, and their pearls,” although
(to be sure) they are not real ones, “they will fling to the swine.”2279 Simplicity they
will have to consist in the overthrow of discipline, attention to which on our part they call
brothelry.2280 Peace also they huddle up2281 anyhow with all comers; for it matters not to
them, however different be their treatment of subjects, provided only they can conspire together
to storm the citadel of the one only Truth. All are puffed up, all offer you knowledge.
Their catechumens are perfect before they are full-taught.2282 The very women of these
heretics, how wanton they are! For they are bold enough to teach, to dispute, to enact exorcisms,
to undertake2283 cures—it may be even to baptize.2284 Their ordinations, are carelessly
administered,2285 capricious, changeable.2286 At one time they put novices in office; at another
time, men who are bound to some secular employment;2287 at another, persons who
have apostatized from us, to bind them by vainglory, since they cannot by the truth. Nowhere
is promotion easier than in the camp of rebels, where the mere fact of being there is a foremost
service.2288 And so it comes to pass that to-day one man is their bishop, to-morrow
another; to-day he is a deacon who to-morrow is a reader; to-day he is a presbyter who tomorrow
is a layman. For even on laymen do they impose the functions of priesthood.</p>

<head>Chapter XLII.—Heretics Work to Pull Down and to Destroy, Not to Edify and Elevate.
Heretics Do Not Adhere Even to Their Own Traditions, But Harbour Dissent
Even from Their Own Founders.</head>
<p>But what shall I say concerning the ministry of the word, since they make it their business
not to convert the heathen, but to subvert our people? This is rather the glory which they
catch at, to compass the fall of those who stand, not the raising of those who are down. Accordingly,
since the very work which they purpose to themselves comes not from the
building up of their own society, but from the demolition of the truth, they undermine our
edifices, that they may erect their own. Only deprive them of the law of Moses, and the
prophets, and the divinity of the Creator, and they have not another objection to talk about.
The consequence is, that they more easily accomplish the ruin of standing houses than the
erection of fallen ruins. It is only when they have such objects in view that they show
themselves humble and bland and respectful. Otherwise they know no respect even for their
own leaders. Hence it is [supposed] that schisms seldom happen among heretics, because,
even when they exist, they are not obvious.2289 Their very unity, however,2290 is schism. I
am greatly in error if they do not amongst themselves swerve even from their own regulations,
forasmuch as every man, just as it suits his own temper, modifies the traditions he has received
after the same fashion as the man who handed them down did, when he moulded
them according to his own will. The progress of the matter is an acknowledgment at once
of its character and of the manner of its birth. That was allowable to the Valentinians which
had been allowed to Valentinus; that was also fair for the Marcionites which had been done
by Marcion—even to innovate on the faith, as was agreeable to their own pleasure. In short,
all heresies, when thoroughly looked into, are detected harbouring dissent in many particulars
even from their own founders. The majority of them have not even churches.2291 Motherless,
houseless, creedless, outcasts, they wander about in their own essential worthlessness.2292</p>

Their Teaching the Very Opposite of Catholic Truth, Which Promotes the Fear

<p>It has also been a subject of remark, how extremely frequent is the intercourse which
heretics hold with magicians, with mountebanks, with astrologers, with philosophers; and
the reason is,2293 that they are men who devote themselves to curious questions. “Seek, and
ye shall find,” is everywhere in their minds. Thus, from the very nature of their conduct,
may be estimated the quality of their faith. In their discipline we have an index of their
doctrine. They say that God is not to be feared; therefore all things are in their view free and
unchecked. Where, however is God not feared, except where He is not? Where God is not,
there truth also is not. Where there is no truth, then, naturally enough, there is also such a
discipline as theirs. But where God is, there exists “the fear of God, which is the beginning
of wisdom.”2294 Where the fear of God is, there is seriousness, an honourable and yet
thoughtful2295 diligence, as well as an anxious carefulness and a well-considered admission
(to the sacred ministry)2296 and a safely-guarded2297 communion, and promotion after
good service, and a scrupulous submission (to authority), and a devout attendance,2298 and

Great Judgment. The Tendency of Heretical Teaching on This Solemn Article
of the Faith. The Present Treatise an Introduction to Certain Other Anti-
Heretical Works of Our Author.</head>
<p>These evidences, then, of a stricter discipline existing among us, are an additional proof
of truth, from which no man can safely turn aside, who bears in mind that future judgment,
when “we must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ,”2299 to render an account of
our faith itself before all things. What, then, will they say who shall have defiled it, even the
virgin which Christ committed to them with the adultery of heretics? I suppose they will
allege that no injunction was ever addressed to them by Him or by His apostles concerning
depraved2300 and perverse doctrines assailing them,2301 or about their avoiding and abhorring
the same. (He and His apostles, perhaps,) will acknowledge2302 that the blame rather
lies with themselves and their disciples, in not having given us previous warning and instruction!
They2303 will, besides, add a good deal respecting the high authority of each doctor
of heresy,—how that these mightily strengthened belief in their own doctrine; how that they
raised the dead, restored the sick, foretold the future, that so they might deservedly be regarded
as apostles. As if this caution were not also in the written record: that many should
come who were to work even the greatest miracles, in defence of the deceit of their corrupt
preaching. So, forsooth, they will deserve to be forgiven! If, however, any, being mindful of
the writings and the denunciations of the Lord and the apostles, shall have stood firm in the
integrity of the faith, I suppose they will run great risk of missing pardon, when the Lord
answers: I plainly forewarned you that there should be teachers of false doctrine in my name,
as well as that of the prophets and apostles also; and to my own disciples did I give a charge,
that they should preach the same things to you. But as for you, it was not, of course, to be
supposed2304 that you would believe me! I once gave the gospel and the doctrine of the said
rule (of life and faith) to my apostles; but afterwards it was my pleasure to make considerable
changes in it! I had promised a resurrection, even of the flesh; but, on second thoughts, it

better father has adopted me! I had forbidden you to lend an ear to heretics; but in this I

right path,2308 and who do not defend2309 the true faith from the danger which besets it.
On the present occasion, indeed, our treatise has rather taken up a general position against
heresies, (showing that they must) all be refuted on definite, equitable, and necessary rules,
without2310 any comparison with the Scriptures. For the rest, if God in His grace permit,
we shall prepare answers to certain of these heresies in separate treatises.2311 To those who
may devote their leisure in reading through these (pages), in the belief of the truth, be peace,

 <p>I.
(Prescription, Chap. I., p. 243, Supra.)</p>
<p>In adopting this expression from the Roman Law, Tertullian has simply puzzled beginners
to get at his idea. Nor do they learn much when it is called a demurrer, which, if I
comprehend the word as used in law-cases, is a rejoinder to the testimony of the other party,
amounting to—“Well, what of it? It does not prove your case.” Something like this is indeed
in Tertullian’s use of the term præscription; but Dr. Holmes furnishes what seems to me the
best explanation, (though he only half renders it,) “the Prescriptive Rule against Heresies.”
In a word, it means, “the Rule of Faith asserted against Heresies.” And his practical point is,
it is useless to discuss Scripture with convicted (Titus iii. 10, 11.) heretics; every one of them
is ready with “his psalm, his doctrine, his interpretation,” and you may argue fruitlessly till
Doomsday. But bring them to the test of (Quod Semper, etc.), the apostolic præscription (1
Corinthians xi. 16).—We have no such custom neither the Churches of God. State this Rule
of Faith, viz. Holy Scripture, as interpreted from the apostolic day: if it proves the doctrine
or custom a novelty, then it has no foundation, and even if it be harmless, it cannot be innocently
professed against the order and peace of the churches.</p>

<p>II.
(Semler, cap. x., note 15, p. 248.)</p>
<p>The extent to which Bp. Kaye has stretched his notice of this critic is to be accounted
for by the fact that, for a time, the German School of the last century exerted a sad influence
in England. In early life Dr. Pusey came near to being led away by it, and Hugh James Rose
was raised up to resist it. Semler lived (at Halle and elsewhere) from a.d. 1725 to 1791. Kahnis
in his invaluable manual, named below, thus speaks of his Patristic theories: “The history
of the Kingdom of God became, under his hands, a world of atoms, which crossed each
other as chaotically as the masses of notes which lay heaped up in the memory of
Semler.…Under his pragmatical touches the halo of the martyrs faded, etc.” Internal Hist.
of German Protestantism (since circa 1750, ) by Ch. Fred. Aug. Kahnis, D.D. (Lutheran)

<pb n="565"/>
 <p>III.
(Peter, cap. xxii. note 6, p. 253.)</p>

<pb n="566"/>
<p>In the treatise of Cyprian, De Unitate, we shall have occasion to speak fully on this interesting
point. The reference to Kaye may suffice, here. But, since the inveterate confusion
of all that is said of Peter with all that is claimed by a modern bishop for himself promotes
a false view of this passage, it may be well to note (1) that St. Peter’s name is expounded by
himself (1 Peter ii. 4, 5) so as to make Christ the Rock and all believers “lively stones”—or
Peters—by faith in Him. St. Peter is often called the rock, most justly, in this sense, by a
rhetorical play on his name: Christ the Rock and all believers “lively stones,” being cemented
with Him by the Spirit. But, (2) this specialty of St. Peter, as such, belongs to him (Cephas)
only. (3) So far as transmitted it belongs to no particular See. (4) The claim of Rome is disproved
by Præscription. (5) Were it otherwise, it would not justify that See in making new
articles of Faith. (6) Nor in its Schism with the East. (7) When it restores St. Peter’s Doctrine
and Holiness, to the Latin Churches, there will be no quarrel about pre-eminence. Meantime,
Rome’s fallibility is expressly taught in Romans xi. 18–21.</p>

 <p>IV.
(The Apostles, cap. xxv. p. 254.)</p>
<p>Nothing less than a new incarnation of Christ and a new commission to new apostles
can give us anything new in religion. This præscription is our Catholic answer to the Vatican
oracles of our own time. These give us a new revelation, prefacing the Gospels (1) by defining
the immaculate conception of Mary in the womb of her mother; and (2) adding a new chapter
to the Acts of the Apostles, in defining the infallibility of a single bishop.</p>
<p>Clearly, had Tertullian known anything of this last dogma of Latin Novelty, he would
not have taken the trouble to write this treatise. He would have said to heretics, We can
neither discuss Scripture nor Antiquity with you. Rome is the touchstone of dogma, and to
its bishop we refer you.</p>

 <p>V.
(Truth and Peace, cap. xliv. p. 265.)</p>
<p>The famous appeal of Bishop Jewel, known as “the Challenge at Paul’s Cross,” which
he made in a sermon preached there on Passion Sunday, a.d. 1560, is an instance of “Præscription
against heresies,” well worthy of being recalled, in a day which has seen Truth and
Peace newly sacrificed to the ceaseless innovations of Rome. It is as follows:—“If any learned
man of all our adversaries, or, if all the learned men that be alive, be able to bring any one
sufficient sentence out of any old Catholic doctor or father; or out of any old general Council;

<pb n="567"/>
or out of the Holy Scriptures of God;2313 or, any one example of the primitive Church,
whereby it may be clearly and plainly proved, that—</p>
<p>1. There was any private mass in the whole world at that time, for the space of six hundred
years after Christ; or that—</p>
<p>2. There was then any communion ministered unto the people under one kind; or that—</p>
<p>3. The people had their common prayers, then, in a strange tongue that they understood
not; or that—</p>
<p>4. The bishop of Rome was then called an universal bishop, or the head of the universal
Church; or that—</p>
<p>5. The people was then taught to believe that Christ’s body is really, substantially, corporally,
carnally or naturally in the Sacrament; or that—</p>
<p>6. His body is, or may be, in a thousand places or more, at one time; or that—</p>
<p>7. The priest did then hold up the Sacrament over his head; or that—</p>
<p>8. The people did then fall down and worship it with godly honour; or that—</p>
<p>9. The Sacrament was then, or now ought to be, hanged up under a canopy; or that—</p>
<p>10. In the Sacrament after the words of consecration there remaineth only the accidents
and shews, without the substance of bread and wine; or that—</p>
<p>11. The priest then divided the Sacrament in three parts and afterwards received himself,
alone; or that—</p>
<p>12. Whosoever had said the Sacrament is a pledge, a token, or a remembrance of Christ’s
body, had therefore been judged a heretic; or that—</p>
<p>13. It was lawful, then, to have thirty, twenty, fifteen, ten, or five masses said in one Church,
in one day; or that—</p>
<p>14. Images were then set up in churches to the intent the people might worship them; or
that—</p>
<p>15. The lay people was then forbidden to read the word of God, in their own tongue:
“If any man alive be able to prove any of these articles, by any one clear or plain clause
or sentence, either of the Scriptures, or of the old doctors, or of any old General Council,
or by any Example of the Primitive Church; I promise, then, that I will give over and subscribe
unto him.”</p>
<p>All this went far beyond the concession of præscription which makes little of any one
saying of any one Father, and demands the general consent of Antiquity; but, it is needless
to say that Jewel’s challenge has remained unanswered for more than three hundred years,
and so it will be to all Eternity.</p>
<note type="footnote">2313 It must be remembered that an appeal to Scripture lies behind Tertullian’s Præscription: only he will
not discuss Holy Scripture with heretics.</note>

<head>Preface by the Translator.2316</head>
<p>The reader has, in this volume a translation (attempted for the first time in English) of
the largest of the extant works of the earliest Latin Fathers. The most important of Tertullian’s
writings have always been highly valued in the church, although, as was natural from
their varied character, for different reasons. Thus his two best-known treatises, The Apology
and The Prescription against Heretics, have divided between them for more than sixteen
centuries the admiration of all intelligent readers,—the one for its masterly defence of the
Christian religion against its heathen persecutors, and the other for its lucid vindication of
the church’s rule of faith against its heretical assailants. The present work has equal claims
on the reader’s appreciation, in respect of those qualities of vigorous thought, close reasoning,
terse expression, and earnest purpose, enlivened by sparkling wit and impassioned eloquence,
which have always secured for Tertullian, in spite of many drawbacks, the esteem which is
given to a great and favourite author. If these books against Marcion have received, as indeed
it must be allowed they have, less attention from the general reader than their intrinsic
merit deserves, the neglect is mainly due to the fact that the interesting character of their
contents is concealed by the usual title-page, which points only to a heresy supposed to be
extinct and inapplicable, whether in the materials of its defence or confutation, to any
modern circumstances. But many treatises of great authors, which have outlived their literal
occasion, retain a value from their collateral arguments, which is not inferior to that effected
by their primary subject. Such is the case with the work before us. If Marcionism is in the
letter obsolete, there is its spirit still left in the church, which in more ways than one develops
its ancient characteristics. What these were, the reader will soon discover in this volume;
but reference may be made even here, in passing, to that prominent aim of the heresy which
gave Tertullian his opportunity of proving the essential coherence of the Old and the New
Testaments, and of exhibiting both his great knowledge of the details of Holy Scripture, and
his fine intelligence of the progressive nature of God’s revelation as a whole. This constitutes
the charm of the present volume, which might almost be designated a Treatise on the Con-

nection between the Jewish and the Christian Scriptures. How interesting this subject is to
earnest men of the present age, is proved by the frequent treatment of it in our religious
literature.2317 In order to assist the reader to a more efficient use of this volume, in reference
to its copiousness of Scripture illustration, a full Index of Scriptural Passages has been drawn
up. Another satisfactory result will, it is believed, accompany the reading of this volume, in
the evidence which it affords of the venerable catholicity of that system of biblical and dogmatic
truth which constitutes the belief of what is called the “orthodox” Christian of the
present day. Orthodoxy has been impugned of late, as if it had suffered much deterioration
in its transmission to us; and an advanced school of thinkers has demanded its reform by
a manipulation which they have called “free handling.” To such readers, then, as prize the
deposit of the Christian creed which they have received, in the light of St. Jude’s description,
as “the faith once for all delivered to the saints,” it cannot but prove satisfactory to be able
to trace in Tertullian, writing more than sixteen centuries ago, the outlines of their own
cherished convictions—held by one who cannot be charged with too great an obsequiousness
to traditional authority, and who at the same time possessed honesty, earnestness, and intelligence
enough to make him an unexceptionable witness to facts of such a kind. The translator
would only add, that he has, in compliance with the wise canon laid down by the editors
of this series, endeavoured always to present to the reader the meaning of the author in
readable English, keeping as near as idiomatic rules allowed to the sense and even style of
the original. Amidst the many well-known difficulties of Tertullian’s writings (and his Anti-
Marcion is not exempt from any of these difficulties,2318) the translator cannot hope that
he has accomplished his labour without mistakes, for which he would beg the reader’s indulgence.
He has, however, endeavoured to obviate the inconvenience of faulty translation by
<note type="footnote">2317 Two works are worth mentioning in connection with this topic for their succinct and handy form, as
well as satisfactory treatment of their argument: Mr. Perowne’s Norrisian prize essay, entitled The Essential
Coherence of the Old and New Testaments (1858), and Sir William Page Wood’s recent work, The Continuity of
Scripture, as declared by the Testimony of our Lord, and of the evangelists and apostles.</note>
<note type="footnote">2318 Bishop Kaye says of Tertullian (page 62): “He is indeed the harshest and most obscure of writers, and
the least capable of being accurately represented in a translation;” and he quotes the learned Ruhnken’s sentence
of our author: “Latinitatis certè pessimum auctorem esse aio et confirmo.” This is surely much too sweeping.
To the careful student Tertullian’s style commends itself, by and by, as suited exactly to his subject—as the terse
and vigorous expression of terse and vigorous thought. Bishop Butler has been often censured for an awkward
style; whereas it is a fairer criticism to say, that the arguments of the Analogy and the Sermons of Human Nature
have been delivered in the language best suited to their character. This adaptation of style to matter is probably
in all great authors a real characteristic of genius. A more just and favourable view is taken of Tertullian’s Latin
by Niebuhr, Hist. Rom. (Schmitz), vol. v. p. 271, and his Lectures on Ancient Hist. (Schmitz), vol. ii. p. 54.</note>

quoting in foot-notes all words, phrases, and passages which appeared to him difficult.2319
He has also added such notes as seemed necessary to illustrate the author’s argument, or to
explain any obscure allusions. The translation has been made always from Oehler’s edition,
with the aid of his scholarly Index Verborum. Use has also been made of Semler’s edition,
and the variorum reprint of the Abbé Migne, the chief result of which recension has been
to convince the translator of the great superiority and general excellence of Oehler’s edition.
When he had completed two-thirds of his work, he happened to meet with the French
translation of Tertullian by Monr. Denain, in Genoude’s series, Les Pères de l’Eglise, published
some twenty-five years ago. This version, which runs in fluent language always, is very unequal
in its relation to the original: sometimes it has the brevity of an abridgment, sometimes
the fulness of a paraphrase. Often does it miss the author’s point, and never does it keep
his style. The Abbé Migne correctly describes it: “Elegans potius quam fidissimus interpres,
qui Africanæ loquelæ asperitatem splendenti ornavit sermone, egregiaque interdum et ad
vivum expressa interpretatione recreavit.”</p>
<note type="footnote">2319 He has also, as the reader will observe, endeavoured to distinguish, by the help of type, between the true
God and Marcion’s god, printing the initials of the former, and of the pronouns referring to Him, in capitals,
and those of the latter in small letters. To do this was not always an easy matter, for in many passages the argument
amalgamates the two. Moreover, in the earlier portion of the work the translator fears that he may have occasionally
neglected to make the distinction.</note>

<p>Whatever in times past2321 we have wrought in opposition to Marcion, is from the
present moment no longer to be accounted of.2322 It is a new work which we are undertaking
in lieu of the old one.2323 My original tract, as too hurriedly composed, I had subsequently
superseded by a fuller treatise. This latter I lost, before it was completely published, by the
fraud of a person who was then a brother,2324 but became afterwards an apostate. He, as it
happened, had transcribed a portion of it, full of mistakes, and then published it. The necessity
thus arose for an amended work; and the occasion of the new edition induced me to make
a considerable addition to the treatise. This present text,2325 therefore, of my work—which
is the third as superseding2326 the second, but henceforward to be considered the first instead

fiercest nations inhabit it, if indeed it can be called habitation, when life is passed in waggons.
They have no fixed abode; their life has2328 no germ of civilization; they indulge their libidinous
desires without restraint, and for the most part naked. Moreover, when they gratify
secret lust, they hang up their quivers on their car-yokes,2329 to warn off the curious and
rash observer. Thus without a blush do they prostitute their weapons of war. The dead
bodies of their parents they cut up with their sheep, and devour at their feasts. They who
have not died so as to become food for others, are thought to have died an accursed death.
Their women are not by their sex softened to modesty. They uncover the breast, from which
they suspend their battle-axes, and prefer warfare to marriage. In their climate, too, there
is the same rude nature.2330 The day-time is never clear, the sun never cheerful;2331 the sky
is uniformly cloudy; the whole year is wintry; the only wind that blows is the angry North.
Waters melt only by fires; their rivers flow not by reason of the ice; their mountains are
covered2332 with heaps of snow. All things are torpid, all stiff with cold. Nothing there has
the glow2333 of life, but that ferocity which has given to scenic plays their stories of the sacrifices2334
of the Taurians, and the loves2335 of the Colchians, and the torments2336 of the
Caucasus. Nothing, however, in Pontus is so barbarous and sad as the fact that Marcion was
born there, fouler than any Scythian, more roving than the waggon-life2337 of the Sarmatian,
more inhuman than the Massagete, more audacious than an Amazon, darker than the
cloud,2338 (of Pontus) colder than its winter, more brittle than its ice, more deceitful than
the Ister, more craggy than Caucasus. Nay2339 more, the true Prometheus, Almighty God,
is mangled2340 by Marcion’s blasphemies. Marcion is more savage than even the beasts of
that barbarous region. For what beaver was ever a greater emasculator2341 than he who has

has gnawed the Gospels to pieces? Verily, O Euxine, thou hast produced a monster more
credible to philosophers than to Christians. For the cynic Diogenes used to go about, lantern
in hand, at mid-day to find a man; whereas Marcion has quenched the light of his faith, and
so lost the God whom he had found. His disciples will not deny that his first faith he held
along with ourselves; a letter of his own2342 proves this; so that for the future2343 a heretic
may from his case2344 be designated as one who, forsaking that which was prior, afterwards
chose out for himself that which was not in times past.2345 For in as far as what was delivered
in times past and from the beginning will be held as truth, in so far will that be accounted
heresy which is brought in later. But another brief treatise2346 will maintain this position
against heretics, who ought to be refuted even without a consideration of their doctrines,
on the ground that they are heretical by reason of the novelty of their opinions. Now, so far
as any controversy is to be admitted, I will for the time2347 (lest our compendious principle
of novelty, being called in on all occasions to our aid, should be imputed to want of confidence)
begin with setting forth our adversary’s rule of belief, that it may escape no one what

<head>Chapter II.—Marcion, Aided by Cerdon, Teaches a Duality of Gods; How He Constructed
This Heresy of an Evil and a Good God.</head>
<p>The heretic of Pontus introduces two Gods, like the twin Symplegades of his own shipwreck:
One whom it was impossible to deny, i.e. our Creator; and one whom he will never
be able to prove, i.e. his own god. The unhappy man gained2348 the first idea2349 of his
conceit from the simple passage of our Lord’s saying, which has reference to human beings
and not divine ones, wherein He disposes of those examples of a good tree and a corrupt
one;2350 how that “the good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit, neither the corrupt tree
good fruit.” Which means, that an honest mind and good faith cannot produce evil deeds,
any more than an evil disposition can produce good deeds. Now (like many other persons
now-a-days, especially those who have an heretical proclivity), while morbidly brooding2351
over the question of the origin of evil, his perception became blunted by the very irregularity
of his researches; and when he found the Creator declaring, “I am He that createth evil,”2352
inasmuch as he had already concluded from other arguments, which are satisfactory to every
perverted mind, that God is the author of evil, so he now applied to the Creator the figure
of the corrupt tree bringing forth evil fruit, that is, moral evil,2353 and then presumed that
there ought to be another god, after the analogy of the good tree producing its good fruit.
Accordingly, finding in Christ a different disposition, as it were—one of a simple and pure
benevolence2354—differing from the Creator, he readily argued that in his Christ had been
revealed a new and strange2355 divinity; and then with a little leaven he leavened the whole
lump of the faith, flavouring it with the acidity of his own heresy.</p>
<p>He had, moreover, in one2356 Cerdon an abettor of this blasphemy,—a circumstance
which made them the more readily think that they saw most clearly their two gods, blind
though they were; for, in truth, they had not seen the one God with soundness of faith.2357
To men of diseased vision even one lamp looks like many. One of his gods, therefore, whom

<head>Chapter III.—The Unity of God. He is the Supreme Being, and There Cannot Be a
Second Supreme.</head>
<p>The principal, and indeed2360 the whole, contention lies in the point of number:
whether two Gods may be admitted, by poetic licence (if they must be),2361 or pictorial
fancy, or by the third process, as we must now add,2362 of heretical pravity. But the Christian
verity has distinctly declared this principle, “God is not, if He is not one;” because we more
properly believe that that has no existence which is not as it ought to be. In order, however,
that you may know that God is one, ask what God is, and you will find Him to be not otherwise
than one. So far as a human being can form a definition of God, I adduce one which
the conscience of all men will also acknowledge,—that God is the great Supreme existing
in eternity, unbegotten, unmade without beginning, without end. For such a condition as
this must needs be ascribed to that eternity which makes God to be the great Supreme, because
for such a purpose as this is this very attribute2363 in God; and so on as to the other
qualities: so that God is the great Supreme in form and in reason, and in might and in
power.2364 Now, since all are agreed on this point (because nobody will deny that God is
in some sense2365 the great Supreme, except the man who shall be able to pronounce the
opposite opinion, that God is but some inferior being, in order that he may deny God by
robbing Him of an attribute of God), what must be the condition of the great Supreme
Himself? Surely it must be that nothing is equal to Him, i.e. that there is no other great supreme;
because, if there were, He would have an equal; and if He had an equal, He would
be no longer the great Supreme, now that the condition and (so to say) our law, which permits
nothing to be equal to the great Supreme, is subverted. That Being, then, which is the great
Supreme, must needs be unique,2366 by having no equal, and so not ceasing to be the great
Supreme. Therefore He will not otherwise exist than by the condition whereby He has His
being; that is, by His absolute uniqueness. Since, then, God is the great Supreme, our
Christian verity has rightly declared,2367 “God is not, if He is not one.” Not as if we doubted

His being God, by saying, He is not, if He is not one; but because we define Him, in whose
being we thoroughly believe, to be that without which He is not God; that is to say, the great
Supreme. But then2368 the great Supreme must needs be unique. This Unique Being,
therefore, will be God—not otherwise God than as the great Supreme; and not otherwise
the great Supreme than as having no equal; and not otherwise having no equal than as being
Unique. Whatever other god, then, you may introduce, you will at least be unable to maintain
his divinity under any other guise,2369 than by ascribing to him too the property of Godhead—
both eternity and supremacy over all. How, therefore, can two great Supremes coexist,
when this is the attribute of the Supreme Being, to have no equal,—an attribute which
belongs to One alone, and can by no means exist in two?</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Defence of the Divine Unity Against Objection. No Analogy Between
Human Powers and God’s Sovereignty. The Objection Otherwise Untenable,
for Why Stop at Two Gods?</head>
<p>But some one may contend that two great Supremes may exist, distinct and separate in
their own departments; and may even adduce, as an example, the kingdoms of the world,
which, though they are so many in number, are yet supreme in their several regions. Such
a man will suppose that human circumstances are always comparable with divine ones.
Now, if this mode of reasoning be at all tolerable, what is to prevent our introducing, I will
not say a third god or a fourth, but as many as there are kings of the earth? Now it is God
that is in question, whose main property it is to admit of no comparison with Himself.
Nature itself, therefore, if not an Isaiah, or rather God speaking by Isaiah, will deprecatingly
ask, “To whom will ye liken me?”2370 Human circumstances may perhaps be compared
with divine ones, but they may not be with God. God is one thing, and what belongs to God
is another thing. Once more:2371 you who apply the example of a king, as a great supreme,
take care that you can use it properly. For although a king is supreme on his throne next to
God, he is still inferior to God; and when he is compared with God, he will be dislodged2372
from that great supremacy which is transferred to God. Now, this being the case, how will
you employ in a comparison with God an object as your example, which fails2373 in all the
purposes which belong to a comparison? Why, when supreme power among kings cannot
evidently be multifarious, but only unique and singular, is an exception made in the case of
Him (of all others)2374 who is King of kings, and (from the exceeding greatness of His power,
and the subjection of all other ranks2375 to Him) the very summit,2376 as it were, of
dominion? But even in the case of rulers of that other form of government, where they one
by one preside in a union of authority, if with their petty2377 prerogatives of royalty, so to
say, they be brought on all points2378 into such a comparison with one another as shall make

it clear which of them is superior in the essential features2379 and powers of royalty, it must
needs follow that the supreme majesty will redound2380 to one alone,—all the others being
gradually, by the issue of the comparison, removed and excluded from the supreme authority.
Thus, although, when spread out in several hands, supreme authority seems to be multifarious,
yet in its own powers, nature, and condition, it is unique. It follows, then, that if two
gods are compared, as two kings and two supreme authorities, the concentration of authority
must necessarily, according to the meaning of the comparison, be conceded to one of the
two; because it is clear from his own superiority that he is the supreme, his rival being now
vanquished, and proved to be not the greater, however great. Now, from this failure of his
rival, the other is unique in power, possessing a certain solitude, as it were, in his singular
pre-eminence. The inevitable conclusion at which we arrive, then, on this point is this: either
we must deny that God is the great Supreme, which no wise man will allow himself to do;
or say that God has no one else with whom to share His power.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—The Dual Principle Falls to the Ground; Plurality of Gods, of Whatever
Number, More Consistent. Absurdity and Injury to Piety Resulting from Marcion’s
Duality.</head>
<p>But on what principle did Marcion confine his supreme powers to two? I would first
ask, If there be two, why not more? Because if number be compatible with the substance of
Deity, the richer you make it in number the better. Valentinus was more consistent and
more liberal; for he, having once imagined two deities, Bythos and Sige,2381 poured forth a
swarm of divine essences, a brood of no less than thirty Æons, like the sow of Æneas.2382
Now, whatever principle refuses to admit several supreme beings, the same must reject even
two, for there is plurality in the very lowest number after one. After unity, number commences.
So, again, the same principle which could admit two could admit more. After two,
multitude begins, now that one is exceeded. In short, we feel that reason herself expressly2383
forbids the belief in more gods than one, because the self-same rule lays down one God and
not two, which declares that God must be a Being to which, as the great Supreme, nothing
is equal; and that Being to which nothing is equal must, moreover, be unique. But further,
what can be the use or advantage in supposing two supreme beings, two co-ordinate2384
powers? What numerical difference could there be when two equals differ not from one?
For that thing which is the same in two is one. Even if there were several equals, all would
be just as much one, because, as equals, they would not differ one from another. So, if of
two beings neither differs from the other, since both of them are on the supposition2385
supreme, both being gods, neither of them is more excellent than the other; and so, having
no pre-eminence, their numerical distinction2386 has no reason in it. Number, moreover,
in the Deity ought to be consistent with the highest reason, or else His worship would be
brought into doubt. For consider2387 now, if, when I saw two Gods before me (who, being
both Supreme Beings, were equal to each other), I were to worship them both, what should
I be doing? I should be much afraid that the abundance of my homage would be deemed
superstition rather than piety. Because, as both of them are so equal and are both included

in either of the two, I might serve them both acceptably in only one; and by this very means
I should attest their equality and unity, provided that I worshipped them mutually the one
in the other, because in the one both are present to me. If I were to worship one of the two,
I should be equally conscious of seeming to pour contempt on the uselessness of a numerical
distinction, which was superfluous, because it indicated no difference; in other words, I
should think it the safer course to worship neither of these two Gods than one of them with
some scruple of conscience, or both of them to none effect.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—Marcion Untrue to His Theory. He Pretends that His Gods are Equal,
But He Really Makes Them Diverse. Then, Allowing Their Divinity, Denies
This Diversity.</head>
<p>Thus far our discussion seems to imply that Marcion makes his two gods equal. For
while we have been maintaining that God ought to be believed as the one only great Supreme
Being, excluding from Him every possibility2388 of equality, we have treated of these topics
on the assumption of two equal Gods; but nevertheless, by teaching that no equals can exist
according to the law2389 of the Supreme Being, we have sufficiently affirmed the impossibility
that two equals should exist. For the rest, however,2390 we know full well2391 that
Marcion makes his gods unequal: one judicial, harsh, mighty in war; the other mild, placid,
and simply2392 good and excellent. Let us with similar care consider also this aspect of the
question, whether diversity (in the Godhead) can at any rate contain two, since equality
therein failed to do so. Here again the same rule about the great Supreme will protect us,
inasmuch as it settles2393 the entire condition of the Godhead. Now, challenging, and in a
certain sense arresting2394 the meaning of our adversary, who does not deny that the Creator
is God, I most fairly object2395 against him that he has no room for any diversity in his gods,
because, having once confessed that they are on a par,2396 he cannot now pronounce them
different; not indeed that human beings may not be very different under the same designation,
but because the Divine Being can be neither said nor believed to be God, except as the great
Supreme. Since, therefore, he is obliged to acknowledge that the God whom he does not
deny is the great Supreme, it is inadmissible that he should predicate of the Supreme Being
such a diminution as should subject Him to another Supreme Being. For He ceases (to be
Supreme), if He becomes subject to any. Besides, it is not the characteristic of God to cease
from any attribute2397 of His divinity—say, from His supremacy. For at this rate the supremacy
would be endangered even in Marcion’s more powerful god, if it were capable of
depreciation in the Creator. When, therefore, two gods are pronounced to be two great Su-

premes, it must needs follow that neither of them is greater or less than the other, neither
of them loftier or lowlier than the other. If you deny2398 him to be God whom you call inferior,
you deny2399 the supremacy of this inferior being. But when you confessed both
gods to be divine, you confessed them both to be supreme. Nothing will you be able to take
away from either of them; nothing will you be able to add. By allowing their divinity, you
have denied their diversity.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—Other Beings Besides God are in Scripture Called God. This Objection
Frivolous, for It is Not a Question of Names. The Divine Essence is the Thing
at Issue. Heresy, in Its General Terms, Thus Far Treated.</head>
<p>But this argument you will try to shake with an objection from the name of God, by alleging
that that name is a vague2400 one, and applied to other beings also; as it is written,
“God standeth in the congregation of the mighty;2401 He judgeth among the gods.” And
again, “I have said, Ye are gods.”2402 As therefore the attribute of supremacy would be inappropriate
to these, although they are called gods, so is it to the Creator. This is a foolish objection;
and my answer to it is, that its author fails to consider that quite as strong an objection
might be urged against the (superior) god of Marcion: he too is called god, but is not on
that account proved to be divine, as neither are angels nor men, the Creator’s handiwork.
If an identity of names affords a presumption in support of equality of condition, how often
do worthless menials strut insolently in the names of kings—your Alexanders, Cæsars, and
Pompeys!2403 This fact, however, does not detract from the real attributes of the royal persons.
Nay more, the very idols of the Gentiles are called gods. Yet not one of them is divine
because he is called a god. It is not, therefore, for the name of god, for its sound or its written
form, that I am claiming the supremacy in the Creator, but for the essence2404 to which the
name belongs; and when I find that essence alone is unbegotten and unmade—alone
eternal, and the maker of all things—it is not to its name, but its state, not to its designation,
but its condition, that I ascribe and appropriate the attribute of the supremacy. And so,
because the essence to which I ascribe it has come2405 to be called god, you suppose that I
ascribe it to the name, because I must needs use a name to express the essence, of which
indeed that Being consists who is called God, and who is accounted the great Supreme because
of His essence, not from His name. In short, Marcion himself, when he imputes this character
to his god, imputes it to the nature,2406 not to the word. That supremacy, then, which we
ascribe to God in consideration of His essence, and not because of His name, ought, as we
maintain, to be equal2407 in both the beings who consist of that substance for which the
name of God is given; because, in as far as they are called gods (i.e. supreme beings, on the

strength, of course, of their unbegotten and eternal, and therefore great and supreme essence),
in so far the attribute of being the great Supreme cannot be regarded as less or worse in one
than in another great Supreme. If the happiness, and sublimity, and perfection2408 of the
Supreme Being shall hold good of Marcion’s god, it will equally so of ours; and if not of
ours, it will equally not hold of Marcion’s. Therefore two supreme beings will be neither
equal nor unequal: not equal, because the principle which we have just expounded, that the
Supreme Being admits of no comparison with Himself, forbids it; not unequal, because another
principle meets us respecting the Supreme Being, that He is capable of no diminution.
So, Marcion, you are caught2409 in the midst of your own Pontic tide. The waves of truth
overwhelm you on every side. You can neither set up equal gods nor unequal ones. For there
are not two; so far as the question of number is properly concerned. Although the whole
matter of the two gods is at issue, we have yet confined our discussion to certain bounds,
within which we shall now have to contend about separate peculiarities.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Specific Points. The Novelty of Marcion’s God Fatal to His Pretensions.
God is from Everlasting, He Cannot Be in Any Wise New.</head>
<p>In the first place, how arrogantly do the Marcionites build up their stupid system,2410
bringing forward a new god, as if we were ashamed of the old one! So schoolboys are proud
of their new shoes, but their old master beats their strutting vanity out of them. Now when
I hear of a new god,2411 who, in the old world and in the old time and under the old god
was unknown and unheard of; whom, (accounted as no one through such long centuries
back, and ancient in men’s very ignorance of him),2412 a certain “Jesus Christ,” and none
else revealed; whom Christ revealed, they say—Christ himself new, according to them, even,
in ancient names—I feel grateful for this conceit2413 of theirs. For by its help I shall at once
be able to prove the heresy of their tenet of a new deity. It will turn out to be such a novelty2414
as has made gods even for the heathen by some new and yet again and ever new
title2415 for each several deification. What new god is there, except a false one? Not even
Saturn will be proved to be a god by all his ancient fame, because it was a novel pretence
which some time or other produced even him, when it first gave him godship.2416 On the
contrary, living and perfect2417 Deity has its origin2418 neither in novelty nor in antiquity,
but in its own true nature. Eternity has no time. It is itself all time. It acts; it cannot then
suffer. It cannot be born, therefore it lacks age. God, if old, forfeits the eternity that is to
come; if new, the eternity which is past.2419 The newness bears witness to a beginning; the
oldness threatens an end. God, moreover, is as independent of beginning and end as He is
of time, which is only the arbiter and measurer of a beginning and an end.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—Marcion’s Gnostic Pretensions Vain, for the True God is Neither
Unknown Nor Uncertain. The Creator, Whom He Owns to Be God, Alone
Supplies an Induction, by Which to Judge of the True God.</head>
<p>Now I know full well by what perceptive faculty they boast of their new god; even their
knowledge.2420 It is, however, this very discovery of a novel thing—so striking to common
minds—as well as the natural gratification which is inherent in novelty, that I wanted to
refute, and thence further to challenge a proof of this unknown god. For him whom by
their knowledge2421 they present to us as new, they prove to have been unknown previous
to that knowledge. Let us keep within the strict limits and measure of our argument. Convince
me there could have been an unknown god. I find, no doubt,2422 that altars have been
lavished on unknown gods; that, however, is the idolatry of Athens. And on uncertain gods;
but that, too, is only Roman superstition. Furthermore, uncertain gods are not well known,
because no certainty about them exists; and because of this uncertainty they are therefore
unknown. Now, which of these two titles shall we carve for Marcion’s god? Both, I suppose,
as for a being who is still uncertain, and was formerly unknown. For inasmuch as the Creator,
being a known God, caused him to be unknown; so, as being a certain God, he made him
to be uncertain. But I will not go so far out of my way, as to say:2423 If God was unknown
and concealed, He was overshadowed in such a region of darkness, as must have been itself
new and unknown, and be even now likewise uncertain—some immense region indeed,
one undoubtedly greater than the God whom it concealed. But I will briefly state my subject,
and afterwards most fully pursue it, promising that God neither could have been, nor ought
to have been, unknown. Could not have been, because of His greatness; ought not to have
been, because of His goodness, especially as He is (supposed, by Marcion) more excellent
in both these attributes than our Creator. Since, however, I observe that in some points the
proof of every new and heretofore unknown god ought, for its test,2424 to be compared to
the form of the Creator, it will be my duty2425 first of all to show that this very course is
adopted by me in a settled plan,2426 such as I might with greater confidence2427 use in
support of my argument. Before every other consideration, (let me ask) how it happens that

you,2428 who acknowledge2429 the Creator to be God, and from your knowledge confess
Him to be prior in existence, do not know that the other god should be examined by you in
exactly the same course of investigation which has taught you how to find out a god in the
first case? Every prior thing has furnished the rule for the latter. In the present question two
gods are propounded, the unknown and the known. Concerning the known there is no2430
question. It is plain that He exists, else He would not be known. The dispute is concerning
the unknown god. Possibly he has no existence; because, if he had, he would have been
known. Now that which, so long as it is unknown, is an object to be questioned, is an uncertainty
so long as it remains thus questionable; and all the while it is in this state of uncertainty,
it possibly has no existence at all. You have a god who is so far certain, as he is known; and
uncertain, as unknown. This being the case, does it appear to you to be justly defensible,
that uncertainties should be submitted for proof to the rule, and form, and standard of certainties?
Now, if to the subject before us, which is in itself full of uncertainty thus far, there
be applied also arguments2431 derived from uncertainties, we shall be involved in such a
series of questions arising out of our treatment of these same uncertain arguments, as shall
by reason of their uncertainty be dangerous to the faith, and we shall drift into those insoluble
questions which the apostle has no affection for. If, again,2432 in things wherein there is
found a diversity of condition, they shall prejudge, as no doubt they will,2433 uncertain,
doubtful, and intricate points, by the certain, undoubted, and clear sides2434 of their rule,
it will probably happen that2435 (those points) will not be submitted to the standard of certainties
for determination, as being freed by the diversity of their essential condition2436
from the application of such a standard in all other respects. As, therefore, it is two gods
which are the subject of our proposition, their essential condition must be the same in both.
For, as concerns their divinity, they are both unbegotten, unmade, eternal. This will be their
essential condition. All other points Marcion himself seems to have made light of,2437 for

he has placed them in a different2438 category. They are subsequent in the order of treatment;
indeed, they will not have to be brought into the discussion,2439 since on the essential condition
there is no dispute. Now there is this absence of our dispute, because they are both
of them gods. Those things, therefore, whose community of condition is evident, will, when
brought to a test on the ground of that common condition,2440 have to be submitted, although
they are uncertain, to the standard2441 of those certainties with which they are classed in
the community of their essential condition, so as on this account to share also in their
manner of proof. I shall therefore contend2442 with the greatest confidence that he is not
God who is to-day uncertain, because he has been hitherto unknown; for of whomsoever
it is evident that he is God, from this very fact it is (equally) evident, that he never has been
unknown, and therefore never uncertain.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—The Creator Was Known as the True God from the First by His Creation.
Acknowledged by the Soul and Conscience of Man Before He Was Revealed by
Moses.</head>
<p>For indeed, as the Creator of all things, He was from the beginning discovered equally
with them, they having been themselves manifested that He might become known as God.
For although Moses, some long while afterwards, seems to have been the first to introduce
the knowledge of2443 the God of the universe in the temple of his writings, yet the birthday
of that knowledge must not on that account be reckoned from the Pentateuch. For the
volume of Moses does not at all initiate2444 the knowledge of the Creator, but from the first
gives out that it is to be traced from Paradise and Adam, not from Egypt and Moses. The
greater part, therefore,2445 of the human race, although they knew not even the name of
Moses, much less his writings, yet knew the God of Moses; and even when idolatry overshadowed
the world with its extreme prevalence, men still spoke of Him separately by His own
name as God, and the God of gods, and said, “If God grant,” and, “As God pleases,” and, “I
commend you to God.”2446 Reflect, then, whether they knew Him, of whom they testify
that He can do all things. To none of the writings of Moses do they owe this. The soul was
before prophecy.2447 From the beginning the knowledge of God is the dowry of the soul,
one and the same amongst the Egyptians, and the Syrians, and the tribes of Pontus. For
their souls call the God of the Jews their God. Do not, O barbarian heretic, put Abraham
before the world. Even if the Creator had been the God of one family, He was yet not later
than your god; even in Pontus was He known before him. Take then your standard from
Him who came first: from the Certain (must be judged) the uncertain; from the Known the
unknown. Never shall God be hidden, never shall God be wanting. Always shall He be understood,
always be heard, nay even seen, in whatsoever way He shall wish. God has for His
witnesses this whole being of ours, and this universe wherein we dwell. He is thus, because
not unknown, proved to be both God and the only One, although another still tries hard to
make out his claim.</p>

Scheme Absurdly Defective, Not Furnishing Evidence for His New God’s Existence,

<p>And justly so, they say. For who is there that is less well known by his own (inherent)
qualities than by strange2448 ones? No one. Well, I keep to this statement. How could anything
be strange2449 to God, to whom, if He were personally existent, nothing would be
strange? For this is the attribute of God, that all things are His, and all things belong to Him;
or else this question would not so readily be heard from us: What has He to do with things
strange to Him?—a point which will be more fully noticed in its proper place. It is now
sufficient to observe, that no one is proved to exist to whom nothing is proved to belong.
For as the Creator is shown to be God, God without any doubt, from the fact that all things
are His, and nothing is strange to Him; so the rival2450 god is seen to be no god, from the
circumstance that nothing is his, and all things are therefore strange to him. Since, then,
the universe belongs to the Creator, I see no room for any other god. All things are full of
their Author, and occupied by Him. If in created beings there be any portion of space anywhere
void of Deity, the void will be of a false deity clearly.2451 By falsehood the truth is
made clear. Why cannot the vast crowd of false gods somewhere find room for Marcion’s
god? This, therefore, I insist upon, from the character2452 of the Creator, that God must
have been known from the works of some world peculiarly His own, both in its human
constituents, and the rest of its organic life;2453 when even the error of the world has presumed
to call gods those men whom it sometimes acknowledges, on the ground that in
every such case something is seen which provides for the uses and advantages of life.2454
Accordingly, this also was believed from the character of God to be a divine function; namely,
to teach or point out what is convenient and needful in human concerns. So completely
has the authority which has given influence to a false divinity been borrowed from that
source, whence it had previously flowed forth to the true one. One stray vegetable2455 at

least Marcion’s god ought to have produced as his own; so might he be preached up as a
new Triptolemus.2456 Or else state some reason which shall be worthy of a God, why he,
supposing him to exist, created nothing; because he must, on supposition of his existence,
have been a creator, on that very principle on which it is clear to us that our God is no otherwise
existent, than as having been the Creator of this universe of ours. For, once for all,
the rule2457 will hold good, that they cannot both acknowledge the Creator to be God, and
also prove him divine whom they wish to be equally believed in as God, except they adjust
him to the standard of Him whom they and all men hold to be God; which is this, that
whereas no one doubts the Creator to be God on the express ground of His having made
the universe, so, on the selfsame ground, no one ought to believe that he also is God who
has made nothing—except, indeed, some good reason be forthcoming. And this must needs
be limited to one of two: he was either unwilling to create, or else unable. There is no third
reason.2458 Now, that he was unable, is a reason unworthy of God. Whether to have been
unwilling to be a worthy one, I want to inquire. Tell me, Marcion, did your god wish himself
to be recognised at any time or not? With what other purpose did he come down from
heaven, and preach, and having suffered rise again from the dead, if it were not that he might
be acknowledged? And, doubtless, since he was acknowledged, he willed it. For no circumstance
could have happened to him, if he had been unwilling. What indeed tended so greatly
to the knowledge of himself, as his appearing in the humiliation of the flesh,—a degradation
all the lower indeed if the flesh were only illusory?2459 For it was all the more shameful if
he, who brought on himself the Creator’s curse by hanging on a tree, only pretended the
assumption of a bodily substance. A far nobler foundation might he have laid for the
knowledge of himself in some evidences of a creation of his own, especially when he had to
become known in opposition to Him in whose territory2460 he had remained unknown by
any works from the beginning. For how happens it that the Creator, although unaware, as
the Marcionites aver, of any god being above Himself, and who used to declare even with
an oath that He existed alone, should have guarded by such mighty works the knowledge
of Himself, about which, on the assumption of His being alone without a rival, He might
have spared Himself all care; while the Superior God, knowing all the while how well furnished
in power His inferior rival was, should have made no provision at all towards getting
Himself acknowledged? Whereas He ought to have produced works more illustrious and
exalted still, in order that He might, after the Creator’s standard, both be acknowledged as

<head>Chapter XII.—Impossibility of Acknowledging God Without This External Evidence2461
Of His Existence. Marcion’s Rejection of Such Evidence for His God
Savours of Impudence and Malignity.</head>
<p>But even if we were able to allow that he exists, we should yet be bound to argue that
he is without a cause.2462 For he who had nothing (to show for himself as proof of his exist-
ence), would be without a cause, since (such) proof2463 is the whole cause that there exists
some person to whom the proof belongs. Now, in as far as nothing ought to be without a
cause, that is, without a proof (because if it be without a cause, it is all one as if it be not, not
having the very proof which is the cause of a thing), in so far shall I more worthily believe
that God does not exist, than that He exists without a cause. For he is without a cause who
has not a cause by reason of not having a proof. God, however, ought not to be without a
cause, that is to say, without a proof. Thus, as often as I show that He exists without a cause,
although (I allow2464 that) He exists, I do really determine this, that He does not exist; because,
if He had existed, He could not have existed altogether without a cause.2465 So, too,
even in regard to faith itself, I say that he2466 seeks to obtain it2467 without cause from man,
who is otherwise accustomed to believe in God from the idea he gets of Him from the
testimony of His works:2468 (without cause, I repeat,) because he has provided no such proof
as that whereby man has acquired the knowledge of God. For although most persons believe
in Him, they do not believe at once by unaided reason,2469 without having some token of
Deity in works worthy of God. And so upon this ground of inactivity and lack of works
he2470 is guilty both of impudence and malignity: of impudence, in aspiring after a belief

<head>Chapter XIII.—The Marcionites Depreciate the Creation, Which, However, is a
Worthy Witness of God. This Worthiness Illustrated by References to the Heathen
Philosophers, Who Were Apt to Invest the Several Parts of Creation with Divine
Attributes.</head>
<p>While we are expelling from this rank (of Deity) a god who has no evidence to show
for himself which is so proper and God-worthy as the testimony of the Creator, Marcion’s
most shameless followers with haughty impertinence fall upon the Creator’s works to destroy
them. To be sure, say they, the world is a grand work, worthy of a God.2472 Then is the
Creator not at all a God? By all means He is God.2473 Therefore2474 the world is not unworthy
of God, for God has made nothing unworthy of Himself; although it was for man, and not
for Himself, that He made the world, (and) although every work is less than its maker. And
yet, if to have been the author of our creation, such as it is, be unworthy of God, how much
more unworthy of Him is it to have created absolutely nothing at all!—not even a production
which, although unworthy, might yet have encouraged the hope of some better attempt.
To say somewhat, then, concerning the alleged2475 unworthiness of this world’s fabric, to
which among the Greeks also is assigned a name of ornament and grace,2476 not of sordidness,
those very professors of wisdom,2477 from whose genius every heresy derives its spirit,
2478 called the said unworthy elements divine; as Thales did water, Heraclitus fire,
Anaximenes air, Anaximander all the heavenly bodies, Strato the sky and earth, Zeno the
air and ether, and Plato the stars, which he calls a fiery kind of gods; whilst concerning the
world, when they considered indeed its magnitude, and strength, and power, and honour,
and glory,—the abundance, too, the regularity, and law of those individual elements which
contribute to the production, the nourishment, the ripening, and the reproduction of all
things,—the majority of the philosophers hesitated2479 to assign a beginning and an end to
the said world, lest its constituent elements,2480 great as they undoubtedly are, should fail
to be regarded as divine,2481 which are objects of worship with the Persian magi, the Egyptian

hierophants, and the Indian gymnosophists. The very superstition of the crowd, inspired
by the common idolatry, when ashamed of the names and fables of their ancient dead borne
by their idols, has recourse to the interpretation of natural objects, and so with much ingenuity
cloaks its own disgrace, figuratively reducing Jupiter to a heated substance, and Juno to
an aërial one (according to the literal sense of the Greek words);2482 Vesta, in like manner,
to fire, and the Muses to waters, and the Great Mother2483 to the earth, mowed as to its
crops, ploughed up with lusty arms, and watered with baths.2484 Thus Osiris also, whenever
he is buried, and looked for to come to life again, and with joy recovered, is an emblem of
the regularity wherewith the fruits of the ground return, and the elements recover life, and
the year comes round; as also the lions of Mithras2485 are philosophical sacraments of arid
and scorched nature. It is, indeed, enough for me that natural elements, foremost in site
and state, should have been more readily regarded as divine than as unworthy of God. I will,
however, come down to2486 humbler objects. A single floweret from the hedgerow, I say
not from the meadows; a single little shellfish from any sea, I say not from the Red Sea; a
single stray wing of a moorfowl, I say nothing of the peacock,—will, I presume, prove to
you that the Creator was but a sorry2487 artificer!</p>

<p>Now, when you make merry with those minuter animals, which their glorious Maker
has purposely endued with a profusion of instincts and resources,2488—thereby teaching
us that greatness has its proofs in lowliness, just as (according to the apostle) there is power
even in infirmity2489—imitate, if you can, the cells of the bee, the hills of the ant, the webs
of the spider, and the threads of the silkworm; endure, too, if you know how, those very
creatures2490 which infest your couch and house, the poisonous ejections of the blisterbeetle,
2491 the spikes of the fly, and the gnat’s sheath and sting. What of the greater animals,
when the small ones so affect you with pleasure or pain, that you cannot even in their case
despise their Creator? Finally, take a circuit round your own self; survey man within and
without. Even this handiwork of our God will be pleasing to you, inasmuch as your own
lord, that better god, loved it so well,2492 and for your sake was at the pains2493 of descending
from the third heaven to these poverty-stricken2494 elements, and for the same reason was
actually crucified in this sorry2495 apartment of the Creator. Indeed, up to the present time,
he has not disdained the water which the Creator made wherewith he washes his people;
nor the oil with which he anoints them; nor that union of honey and milk wherewithal he
gives them the nourishment2496 of children; nor the bread by which he represents his own
proper body, thus requiring in his very sacraments the “beggarly2497 elements” of the Creator.
You, however, are a disciple above his master, and a servant above his lord; you have
a higher reach of discernment than his; you destroy what he requires. I wish to examine
whether you are at least honest in this, so as to have no longing for those things which you
destroy. You are an enemy to the sky, and yet you are glad to catch its freshness in your

<head>Chapter XV.—The Lateness of the Revelation of Marcion’s God. The Question of
the Place Occupied by the Rival Deities. Instead of Two Gods, Marcion Really
(Although, as It Would Seem, Unconsciously) Had Nine Gods in His System.</head>
<p>After all, or, if you like,2502 before all, since you have said that he has a creation2503 of
his own, and his own world, and his own sky; we shall see,2504 indeed, about that third
heaven, when we come to discuss even your own apostle.2505 Meanwhile, whatever is the
(created) substance, it ought at any rate to have made its appearance in company with its
own god. But now, how happens it that the Lord has been revealed since the twelfth year of
Tiberius Cæsar, while no creation of His at all has been discovered up to the fifteenth of the
Emperor Severus;2506 although, as being more excellent than the paltry works2507 of the
Creator, it should certainly have ceased to conceal itself, when its lord and author no longer
lies hid? I ask, therefore,2508 if it was unable to manifest itself in this world, how did its Lord
appear in this world? If this world received its Lord, why was it not able to receive the created
substance, unless perchance it was greater than its Lord? But now there arises a question
about place, having reference both to the world above and to the God thereof. For, behold,
if he2509 has his own world beneath him, above the Creator, he has certainly fixed it in a
position, the space of which was empty between his own feet and the Creator’s head.
Therefore God both Himself occupied local space, and caused the world to occupy local
space; and this local space, too, will be greater than God and the world together. For in no
case is that which contains not greater than that which is contained. And indeed we must
look well to it that no small patches2510 be left here and there vacant, in which some third
god also may be able with a world of his own to foist himself in.2511 Now, begin to reckon

up your gods. There will be local space for a god, not only as being greater than God, but
as being also unbegotten and unmade, and therefore eternal, and equal to God, in which
God has ever been. Then, inasmuch as He too has fabricated2512 a world out of some underlying
material which is unbegotten, and unmade, and contemporaneous with God, just as
Marcion holds of the Creator, you reduce this likewise to the dignity of that local space
which has enclosed two gods, both God and matter. For matter also is a god according to
the rule of Deity, being (to be sure) unbegotten, and unmade, and eternal. If, however, it
was out of nothing that he made his world, this also (our heretic) will be obliged to predicate2513
of the Creator, to whom he subordinates2514 matter in the substance of the world.
But it will be only right that he2515 too should have made his world out of matter, because
the same process occurred to him as God which lay before the Creator as equally God. And
thus you may, if you please, reckon up so far,2516 three gods as Marcion’s,—the Maker,
local space, and matter. Furthermore,2517 he in like manner makes the Creator a god in
local space, which is itself to be appraised on a precisely identical scale of dignity; and to
Him as its lord he subordinates matter, which is notwithstanding unbegotten, and unmade,
and by reason hereof eternal. With this matter he further associates evil, an unbegotten
principle with an unbegotten object, an unmade with an unmade, and an eternal with an
eternal; so here he makes a fourth God. Accordingly you have three substances of Deity in
the higher instances, and in the lower ones four. When to these are added their Christs—the
one which appeared in the time of Tiberius, the other which is promised by the Creator—Marcion
suffers a manifest wrong from those persons who assume that he holds two gods,
whereas he implies2518 no less than nine,2519 though he knows it not.</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—Marcion Assumes the Existence of Two Gods from the Antithesis
Between Things Visible and Things Invisible. This Antithetical Principle in Fact
Characteristic of the Works of the Creator, the One God—Maker of All Things
Visible and Invisible.</head>
<p>Since, then, that other world does not appear, nor its god either, the only resource left2520
to them is to divide things into the two classes of visible and invisible, with two gods for
their authors, and so to claim2521 the invisible for their own, (the supreme) God. But who,
except an heretical spirit, could ever bring his mind to believe that the invisible part of creation
belongs to him who had previously displayed no visible thing, rather than to Him
who, by His operation on the visible world, produced a belief in the invisible also, since it
is far more reasonable to give one’s assent after some samples (of a work) than after none?
We shall see to what author even (your favourite) apostle attributes2522 the invisible creation,
when we come to examine him. At present (we withhold his testimony), for2523 we are for
the most part engaged in preparing the way, by means of common sense and fair arguments,
for a belief in the future support of the Scriptures also. We affirm, then, that this diversity
of things visible and invisible must on this ground be attributed to the Creator, even because
the whole of His work consists of diversities—of things corporeal and incorporeal; of animate
and inanimate; of vocal and mute of moveable and stationary; of productive and sterile; of
arid and moist; of hot and cold. Man, too, is himself similarly tempered with diversity, both
in his body and in his sensation. Some of his members are strong, others weak; some comely,
others uncomely; some twofold, others unique; some like, others unlike. In like manner
there is diversity also in his sensation: now joy, then anxiety; now love, then hatred; now
anger, then calmness. Since this is the case, inasmuch as the whole of this creation of ours
has been fashioned2524 with a reciprocal rivalry amongst its several parts, the invisible ones
are due to the visible, and not to be ascribed to any other author than Him to whom their
counterparts are imputed, marking as they do diversity in the Creator Himself, who orders
what He forbade, and forbids what He ordered; who also strikes and heals. Why do they
take Him to be uniform in one class of things alone, as the Creator of visible things, and
only them; whereas He ought to be believed to have created both the visible and the invisible,
in just the same way as life and death, or as evil things and peace?2525 And verily, if the in-

<head>Chapter XVII.—Not Enough, as the Marcionites Pretend, that the Supreme God
Should Rescue Man; He Must Also Have Created Him. The Existence of God
Proved by His Creation, a Prior Consideration to His Character.</head>
<p>Pressed by these arguments, they exclaim: One work is sufficient for our god; he has
delivered man by his supreme and most excellent goodness, which is preferable to (the
creation of) all the locusts.2526 What superior god is this, of whom it has not been possible
to find any work so great as the man of the lesser god! Now without doubt the first thing
you have to do is to prove that he exists, after the same manner that the existence of God
must ordinarily be proved—by his works; and only after that by his good deeds. For the first
question is, Whether he exists? and then, What is his character? The former is to be tested2527
by his works, the other by the beneficence of them. It does not simply follow that he exists,
because he is said to have wrought deliverance for man; but only after it shall have been
settled that he exists, will there be room for saying that he has affected this liberation. And
even this point also must have its own evidence, because it may be quite possible both that
he has existence, and yet has not wrought the alleged deliverance. Now in that section of
our work which concerned the question of the unknown god, two points were made clear
enough—both that he had created nothing: and that he ought to have been a creator, in
order to be known by his works; because, if he had existed, he ought to have been known,
and that too from the beginning of things; for it was not fit that God should have lain hid.
It will be necessary that I should revert to the very trunk of that question of the unknown
god, that I may strike off into some of its other branches also. For it will be first of all proper
to inquire, Why he, who afterwards brought himself into notice, did so—so late, and not at
the very first? From creatures, with which as God he was indeed so closely connected (and
the closer this connection was,2528 the greater was his goodness), he ought never to have
been hidden. For it cannot be pretended that there was not either any means of arriving at
the knowledge of God, or a good reason for it, when from the beginning man was in the
world, for whom the deliverance is now come; as was also that malevolence of the Creator,
in opposition to which the good God has wrought the deliverance. He was therefore either
ignorant of the good reason for and means of his own necessary manifestation, or doubted
them; or else was either unable or unwilling to encounter them. All these alternatives are

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Notwithstanding Their Conceits, the God of the Marcionites Fails
in the Vouchers Both of Created Evidence and of Adequate Revelation.</head>
<p>Well, then,2531 he has now advanced into notice, just when he willed, when he could,
when the destined hour arrived. For perhaps he was hindered hitherto by his leading star,2532
or some weird malignants, or Saturn in quadrature,2533 or Mars at the trine.2534 The Marcionites
are very strongly addicted to astrology; nor do they blush to get their livelihood by
help of the very stars which were made by the Creator (whom they depreciate). We must
here also treat of the quality2535 of the (new) revelation; whether Marcion’s supreme god
has become known in a way worthy of him, so as to secure the proof of his existence: and
in the way of truth, so that he may be believed to be the very being who had been already
proved to have been revealed in a manner worthy of his character. For things which are
worthy of God will prove the existence of God. We maintain2536 that God must first be
known2537 from nature, and afterwards authenticated2538 by instruction: from nature by
His works; by instruction,2539 through His revealed announcements.2540 Now, in a case
where nature is excluded, no natural means (of knowledge) are furnished. He ought,
therefore, to have carefully supplied2541 a revelation of himself, even by announcements,
especially as he had to be revealed in opposition to One who, after so many and so great
works, both of creation and revealed announcement, had with difficulty succeeded in satisfying2542
men’s faith. In what manner, therefore, has the revelation been made? If by man’s
conjectural guesses, do not say that God can possibly become known in any other way than
by Himself, and appeal not only to the standard of the Creator, but to the conditions both
of God’s greatness and man’s littleness; so that man seem not by any possibility to be

greater than God, by having somehow drawn Him out into public recognition, when He
was Himself unwilling to become known by His own energies, although man’s littleness has
been able, according to experiments all over the world, more easily to fashion for itself gods,
than to follow the true God whom men now understand by nature. As for the rest,2543 if
man shall be thus able to devise a god,—as Romulus did Consus, and Tatius Cloacina, and
Hostilius Fear, and Metellus Alburnus, and a certain authority2544 some time since Antinous,—
the same accomplishment may be allowed to others. As for us, we have found our
pilot in Marcion, although not a king nor an emperor.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—Jesus Christ, the Revealer of the Creator, Could Not Be the Same as
Marcion’s God, Who Was Only Made Known by the Heretic Some CXV. Years
After Christ, and That, Too, on a Principle Utterly Unsuited to the Teaching of
Jesus Christ, I.e., the Opposition Between the Law and the Gospels.</head>
<p>Well, but our god, say the Marcionites, although he did not manifest himself from the
beginning and by means of the creation, has yet revealed himself in Christ Jesus. A book
will be devoted2545 to Christ, treating of His entire state; for it is desirable that these subjectmatters
should be distinguished one from another, in order that they may receive a fuller
and more methodical treatment. Meanwhile it will be sufficient if, at this stage of the question,
I show—and that but briefly—that Christ Jesus is the revealer2546 of none other god but the
Creator. In the fifteenth year of Tiberius,2547 Christ Jesus vouchsafed to come down from
heaven, as the spirit of saving health.2548 I cared not to inquire, indeed, in what particular
year of the elder Antoninus. He who had so gracious a purpose did rather, like a pestilential
sirocco,2549 exhale this health or salvation, which Marcion teaches from his Pontus. Of this
teacher there is no doubt that he is a heretic of the Antonine period, impious under the pious.
Now, from Tiberius to Antoninus Pius, there are about 115 years and 6-1/2 months. Just
such an interval do they place between Christ and Marcion. Inasmuch, then, as Marcion,
as we have shown, first introduced this god to notice in the time of Antoninus, the matter
becomes at once clear, if you are a shrewd observer. The dates already decide the case, that
he who came to light for the first time2550 in the reign of Antoninus, did not appear in that
of Tiberius; in other words, that the God of the Antonine period was not the God of the
Tiberian; and consequently, that he whom Marcion has plainly preached for the first time,
was not revealed by Christ (who announced His revelation as early as the reign of Tiberius).
Now, to prove clearly what remains of the argument, I shall draw materials from my very
adversaries. Marcion’s special and principal work is the separation of the law and the gospel;
and his disciples will not deny that in this point they have their very best pretext for initiating
and confirming themselves in his heresy. These are Marcion’s Antitheses, or contradictory
propositions, which aim at committing the gospel to a variance with the law, in order that
from the diversity of the two documents which contain them,2551 they may contend for a

diversity of gods also. Since, therefore, it is this very opposition between the law and the
gospel which has suggested that the God of the gospel is different from the God of the law,
it is clear that, before the said separation, that god could not have been known who became
known2552 from the argument of the separation itself. He therefore could not have been
revealed by Christ, who came before the separation, but must have been devised by Marcion,
the author of the breach of peace between the gospel and the law. Now this peace, which
had remained unhurt and unshaken from Christ’s appearance to the time of Marcion’s audacious
doctrine, was no doubt maintained by that way of thinking, which firmly held that
the God of both law and gospel was none other than the Creator, against whom after so
long a time a separation has been introduced by the heretic of Pontus.</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—Marcion, Justifying His Antithesis Between the Law and the Gospel
by the Contention of St. Paul with St. Peter, Shown to Have Mistaken St. Paul’s
Position and Argument. Marcion’s Doctrine Confuted Out of St. Paul’s Teaching,
Which Agrees Wholly with the Creator’s Decrees.</head>
<p>This most patent conclusion requires to be defended by us against the clamours of the
opposite side. For they allege that Marcion did not so much innovate on the rule (of faith)
by his separation of the law and the gospel, as restore it after it had been previously adulterated.
O Christ,2553 most enduring Lord, who didst bear so many years with this interference
with Thy revelation, until Marcion forsooth came to Thy rescue! Now they adduce the case
of Peter himself, and the others, who were pillars of the apostolate, as having been blamed
by Paul for not walking uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel—that very Paul indeed,
who, being yet in the mere rudiments of grace, and trembling, in short, lest he should have
run or were still running in vain, then for the first time held intercourse with those who
were apostles before himself. Therefore because, in the eagerness of his zeal against Judaism
as a neophyte, he thought that there was something to be blamed in their conduct—even
the promiscuousness of their conversation2554—but afterwards was himself to become in
his practice all things to all men, that he might gain all,—to the Jews, as a Jew, and to them
that were under the law, as under the law,—you would have his censure, which was merely
directed against conduct destined to become acceptable even to their accuser, suspected of
prevarication against God on a point of public doctrine.2555 Touching their public doctrine,
however, they had, as we have already said, joined hands in perfect concord, and had agreed
also in the division of their labour in their fellowship of the gospel, as they had indeed in all
other respects:2556 “Whether it were I or they, so we preach.”2557 When, again, he mentioned
“certain false brethren as having crept in unawares,” who wished to remove the Galatians
into another gospel,2558 he himself shows that that adulteration of the gospel was not meant
to transfer them to the faith of another god and christ, but rather to perpetuate the teaching
of the law; because he blames them for maintaining circumcision, and observing times, and
days, and months, and years, according to those Jewish ceremonies which they ought to
have known were now abrogated, according to the new dispensation purposed by the Creator
Himself, who of old foretold this very thing by His prophets. Thus He says by Isaiah:

Old things have passed away. “Behold, I will do a new thing.”2559 And in another passage:
“I will make a new covenant, not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers,
when I brought them out of the land of Egypt.”2560 In like manner by Jeremiah: Make to
yourselves a new covenant, “circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away the foreskins
of your heart.”2561 It is this circumcision, therefore, and this renewal, which the apostle insisted
on, when he forbade those ancient ceremonies concerning which their very founder
announced that they were one day to cease; thus by Hosea: “I will also cause all her mirth
to cease, her feast-days, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.”2562
So likewise by Isaiah: “The new moons, and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot
away with; your holy days, and fasts, and feast-days, my soul hateth.”2563 Now, if even the
Creator had so long before discarded all these things, and the apostle was now proclaiming
them to be worthy of renunciation, the very agreement of the apostle’s meaning with the
decrees of the Creator proves that none other God was preached by the apostle than He
whose purposes he now wished to have recognised, branding as false both apostles and
brethren, for the express reason that they were pushing back the gospel of Christ the Creator
from the new condition which the Creator had foretold, to the old one which He had discarded.</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—St. Paul Preached No New God, When He Announced the Repeal
of Some of God’s Ancient Ordinances. Never Any Hesitation About Belief in
the Creator, as the God Whom Christ Revealed, Until Marcion’s Heresy.</head>
<p>Now if it was with the view of preaching a new god that he was eager to abrogate the
law of the old God, how is it that he prescribes no rule about2564 the new god, but solely
about the old law, if it be not because faith in the Creator2565 was still to continue, and His
law alone was to come to an end?2566—just as the Psalmist had declared: “Let us break their
bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us. Why do the heathen rage, and the people
imagine a vain thing? The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel together
against the Lord, and against His Anointed.”2567 And, indeed, if another god were preached
by Paul, there could be no doubt about the law, whether it were to be kept or not, because
of course it would not belong to the new lord, the enemy2568 of the law. The very newness
and difference of the god would take away not only all question about the old and alien law,
but even all mention of it. But the whole question, as it then stood, was this, that although
the God of the law was the same as was preached in Christ, yet there was a disparagement2569
of His law. Permanent still, therefore, stood faith in the Creator and in His Christ; manner
of life and discipline alone fluctuated.2570 Some disputed about eating idol sacrifices, others
about the veiled dress of women, others again about marriage and divorce, and some even
about the hope of the resurrection; but about God no one disputed. Now, if this question
also had entered into dispute, surely it would be found in the apostle, and that too as a great
and vital point. No doubt, after the time of the apostles, the truth respecting the belief of
God suffered corruption, but it is equally certain that during the life of the apostles their
teaching on this great article did not suffer at all; so that no other teaching will have the
right of being received as apostolic than that which is at the present day proclaimed in the
churches of apostolic foundation. You will, however, find no church of apostolic origin2571
but such as reposes its Christian faith in the Creator.2572 But if the churches shall prove to
have been corrupt from the beginning, where shall the pure ones be found? Will it be amongst

the adversaries of the Creator? Show us, then, one of your churches, tracing its descent from
an apostle, and you will have gained the day.2573 Forasmuch then as it is on all accounts
evident that there was from Christ down to Marcion’s time no other God in the rule of
sacred truth2574 than the Creator, the proof of our argument is sufficiently established, in
which we have shown that the god of our heretic first became known by his separation of
the gospel and the law. Our previous position2575 is accordingly made good, that no god
is to be believed whom any man has devised out of his own conceits; except indeed the man
be a prophet,2576 and then his own conceits would not be concerned in the matter. If Marcion,
however, shall be able to lay claim to this inspired character, it will be necessary for it
to be shown. There must be no doubt or paltering.2577 For all heresy is thrust out by this
wedge of the truth, that Christ is proved to be the revealer of no God else but the Creator.2578</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—God’s Attribute of Goodness Considered as Natural; The God of
Marcion Found Wanting Herein. It Came Not to Man’s Rescue When First
Wanted.</head>
<p>But how shall (this) Antichrist be fully overthrown unless we relax our defence by mere
prescription,2579 and give ourselves scope for rebutting all his other attacks? Let us therefore
next take the very person of God Himself, or rather His shadow or phantom,2580 as we have
it in Christ, and let Him be examined by that condition which makes Him superior to the
Creator. And undoubtedly there will come to hand unmistakeable rules for examining God’s
goodness. My first point, however, is to discover and apprehend the attribute, and then to
draw it out into rules. Now, when I survey the subject in its aspects of time, I nowhere descry
it2581 from the beginning of material existences, or at the commencement of those causes,
with which it ought to have been found, proceeding thence to do2582 whatever had to be
done. For there was death already, and sin the sting of death, and that malignity too of the
Creator, against which the goodness of the other god should have been ready to bring relief;
falling in with this as the primary rule of the divine goodness (if it were to prove itself a
natural agency), at once coming as a succour when the cause for it began. For in God all
things should be natural and inbred, just like His own condition indeed, in order that they
may be eternal, and so not be accounted casual2583 and extraneous, and thereby temporary
and wanting in eternity. In God, therefore, goodness is required to be both perpetual and
unbroken,2584 such as, being stored up and kept ready in the treasures of His natural
properties, might precede its own causes and material developments; and if thus preceding,
might underlie2585 every first material cause, instead of looking at it from a distance,2586
and standing aloof from it.2587 In short, here too I must inquire, Why his2588 goodness did
not operate from the beginning? no less pointedly than when we inquired concerning
<note type="footnote">2579 In his book, De Præscrip. Hæret., [cap. xv.] Tertullian had enjoined that heretics ought not to be argued

himself, Why he was not revealed from the very first? Why, then, did it not? since he had
to be revealed by his goodness if he had any existence. That God should at all fail in power
must not be thought, much less that He should not discharge all His natural functions; for
if these were restrained from running their course, they would cease to be natural. Moreover,
the nature of God Himself knows nothing of inactivity. Hence (His goodness) is reckoned
as having a beginning,2589 if it acts. It will thus be evident that He had no unwillingness to
exercise His goodness at any time on account of His nature. Indeed, it is impossible that He
should be unwilling because of His nature, since that so directs itself that it would no longer
exist if it ceased to act. In Marcion’s god, however, goodness ceased from operation at some
time or other. A goodness, therefore, which could thus at any time have ceased its action
was not natural, because with natural properties such cessation is incompatible. And if it
shall not prove to be natural, it must no longer be believed to be eternal nor competent to
Deity; because it cannot be eternal so long as, failing to be natural, it neither provides from
the past nor guarantees for the future any means of perpetuating itself. Now as a fact it existed
not from the beginning, and, doubtless, will not endure to the end. For it is possible for it
to fail in existence some future2590 time or other, as it has failed in some past2591 period.
Forasmuch, then, as the goodness of Marcion’s god failed in the beginning (for he did not
from the first deliver man), this failure must have been the effect of will rather than of infirmity.
Now a wilful suppression of goodness will be found to have a malignant end in
view. For what malignity is so great as to be unwilling to do good when one can, or to
thwart2592 what is useful, or to permit injury? The whole description, therefore, of Marcion’s
Creator will have to be transferred2593 to his new god, who helped on the ruthless2594 proceedings
of the former by the retardation of his own goodness. For whosoever has it in his
power to prevent the happening of a thing, is accounted responsible for it if it should occur.
Man is condemned to death for tasting the fruit of one poor tree,2595 and thence proceed
sins with their penalties; and now all are perishing who yet never saw a single sod of Paradise.

this account be deemed the better, and the Creator be regarded as all that the worse? Even
if this were his purpose he would be malicious enough, for both wishing to aggravate his
rival’s obloquy by permitting His (evil) works to be done, and by keeping the world harrassed
by the wrong. What would you think of a physician who should encourage a disease by
withholding the remedy, and prolong the danger by delaying his prescription, in order that
his cure might be more costly and more renowned? Such must be the sentence to be pronounced
against Marcion’s god: tolerant of evil, encouraging wrong, wheedling about his
grace, prevaricating in his goodness, which he did not exhibit simply on its own account,
but which he must mean to exhibit purely, if he is good by nature and not by acquisition,2597
if he is supremely good in attribute2598 and not by discipline, if he is God from eternity and
not from Tiberius, nay (to speak more truly), from Cerdon only and Marcion. As the case
now stands,2599 however, such a god as we are considering would have been more fit for
Tiberius, that the goodness of the Divine Being might be inaugurated in the world under
his imperial sway!</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—God’s Attribute of Goodness Considered as Rational. Marcion’s
God Defective Here Also; His Goodness Irrational and Misapplied.</head>
<p>Here is another rule for him. All the properties of God ought to be as rational as they
are natural. I require reason in His goodness, because nothing else can properly be accounted
good than that which is rationally good; much less can goodness itself be detected in any
irrationality. More easily will an evil thing which has something rational belonging to it be
accounted good, than that a good thing bereft of all reasonable quality should escape being
regarded as evil. Now I deny that the goodness of Marcion’s god is rational, on this account
first, because it proceeded to the salvation of a human creature which was alien to him. I
am aware of the plea which they will adduce, that that is rather2600 a primary and perfect
goodness which is shed voluntarily and freely upon strangers without any obligation of
friendship,2601 on the principle that we are bidden to love even our enemies, such as are
also on that very account strangers to us. Now, inasmuch as from the first he had no regard
for man, a stranger to him from the first, he settled beforehand, by this neglect of his, that
he had nothing to do with an alien creature. Besides, the rule of loving a stranger or enemy
is preceded by the precept of your loving your neighbour as yourself; and this precept, although
coming from the Creator’s law, even you ought to receive, because, so far from being
abrogated by Christ, it has rather been confirmed by Him. For you are bidden to love your
enemy and the stranger, in order that you may love your neighbour the better. The requirement
of the undue is an augmentation of the due benevolence. But the due precedes the
undue, as the principal quality, and more worthy of the other, for its attendant and companion.
2602 Since, therefore, the first step in the reasonableness of the divine goodness is that
it displays itself on its proper object2603 in righteousness, and only at its second stage on an
alien object by a redundant righteousness over and above that of scribes and Pharisees, how
comes it to pass that the second is attributed to him who fails in the first, not having man
for his proper object, and who makes his goodness on this very account defective? Moreover,
how could a defective benevolence, which had no proper object whereon to expend itself,

next sentence to these words, making the last clause run thus: “ut dignior ministra, et comite sua, id est indebita,
prior”—“as being more worthy of an attendant, and as being prior to its companion, that is, the undue benevolence.”
It is difficult to find any good use of the “prior” in the next sentence, “Prior igitur cum prima bonitatis
ratio sit,” etc., as Oehler and others point it.</note>

overflow2604 on an alien one? Clear up the first step, and then vindicate the next. Nothing
can be claimed as rational without order, much less can reason itself2605 dispense with order
in any one. Suppose now the divine goodness begin at the second stage of its rational operation,
that is to say, on the stranger, this second stage will not be consistent in rationality if
it be impaired in any way else.2606 For only then will even the second stage of goodness,
that which is displayed towards the stranger, be accounted rational, when it operates without
wrong to him who has the first claim.2607 It is righteousness2608 which before everything
else makes all goodness rational. It will thus be rational in its principal stage, when manifested
on its proper object, if it be righteous. And thus, in like manner, it will be able to appear
rational, when displayed towards the stranger, if it be not unrighteous. But what sort of
goodness is that which is manifested in wrong, and that in behalf of an alien creature? For
peradventure a benevolence, even when operating injuriously, might be deemed to some
extent rational, if exerted for one of our own house and home.2609 By what rule, however,
can an unjust benevolence, displayed on behalf of a stranger, to whom not even an honest
one is legitimately due, be defended as a rational one? For what is more unrighteous, more
unjust, more dishonest, than so to benefit an alien slave as to take him away from his master,
claim him as the property of another, and suborn him against his master’s life; and all this,
to make the matter more iniquitous still whilst he is yet living in his master’s house and on
his master’s garner, and still trembling beneath his stripes? Such a deliverer,2610 I had almost
said2611 kidnapper,2612 would even meet with condemnation in the world. Now, no other
than this is the character of Marcion’s god, swooping upon an alien world, snatching away
man from his God,2613 the son from his father, the pupil from his tutor, the servant from
his master—to make him impious to his God, undutiful to his father, ungrateful to his tutor,
worthless to his master. If, now, the rational benevolence makes man such, what sort of
being prithee2614 would the irrational make of him? None I should think more shameless
than him who is baptized to his2615 god in water which belongs to another, who stretches

<head>Chapter XXIV.—The Goodness of Marcion’s God Only Imperfectly Manifested; It
Saves But Few, and the Souls Merely of These. Marcion’s Contempt of the Body
Absurd.</head>
<p>But as God is eternal and rational, so, I think, He is perfect in all things. “Be ye perfect,
even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.”2619 Prove, then, that the goodness of
your god also is a perfect one. That it is indeed imperfect has been already sufficiently shown,
since it is found to be neither natural nor rational. The same conclusion, however, shall now
be made clear2620 by another method; it is not simply2621 imperfect, but actually2622 feeble,
weak, and exhausted, failing to embrace the full number2623 of its material objects, and not
manifesting itself in them all. For all are not put into a state of salvation2624 by it; but the
Creator’s subjects, both Jew and Christian, are all excepted.2625 Now, when the greater part
thus perish, how can that goodness be defended as a perfect one which is inoperative in
most cases, is somewhat only in few, naught in many, succumbs to perdition, and is a partner
with destruction?2626 And if so many shall miss salvation, it will not be with goodness, but
with malignity, that the greater perfection will lie. For as it is the operation of goodness
which brings salvation, so is it malevolence which thwarts it.2627 Since, however, this
goodness) saves but few, and so rather leans to the alternative of not saving, it will show itself
to greater perfection by not interposing help than by helping. Now, you will not be able to
attribute goodness (to your god) in reference to the Creator, (if accompanied with) failure
towards all. For whomsoever you call in to judge the question, it is as a dispenser of goodness,
if so be such a title can be made out,2628 and not as a squanderer thereof, as you claim your
god to be, that you must submit the divine character for determination. So long, then, as
you prefer your god to the Creator on the simple ground of his goodness, and since he
professes to have this attribute as solely and wholly his own, he ought not to have been
wanting in it to any one. However, I do not now wish to prove that Marcion’s god is imperfect

in goodness because of the perdition of the greater number. I am content to illustrate this
imperfection by the fact that even those whom he saves are found to possess but an imperfect
salvation—that is, they are saved only so far as the soul is concerned,2629 but lost in their
body, which, according to him, does not rise again. Now, whence comes this halving of
salvation, if not from a failure of goodness? What could have been a better proof of a perfect
goodness, than the recovery of the whole man to salvation? Totally damned by the Creator,
he should have been totally restored by the most merciful god. I rather think that by Marcion’s
rule the body is baptized, is deprived of marriage,2630 is cruelly tortured in confession. But
although sins are attributed to the body, yet they are preceded by the guilty concupiscence
of the soul; nay, the first motion of sin must be ascribed to the soul, to which the flesh acts
in the capacity of a servant. By and by, when freed from the soul, the flesh sins no more.2631
So that in this matter goodness is unjust, and likewise imperfect, in that it leaves to destruction
the more harmless substance, which sins rather by compliance than in will. Now, although
Christ put not on the verity of the flesh, as your heresy is pleased to assume, He still
vouchsafed to take upon Him the semblance thereof. Surely, therefore, some regard was
due to it from Him, because of this His feigned assumption of it. Besides, what else is man
than flesh, since no doubt it was the corporeal rather than the spiritual2632 element from
which the Author of man’s nature gave him his designation?2633 “And the Lord God made
man of the dust of the ground,” not of spiritual essence; this afterwards came from the divine
afflatus: “and man became a living soul.” What, then, is man? Made, no doubt of it, of the
dust; and God placed him in paradise, because He moulded him, not breathed him, into
being—a fabric of flesh, not of spirit. Now, this being the case, with what face will you contend
for the perfect character of that goodness which did not fail in some one particular only of
man’s deliverance, but in its general capacity? If that is a plenary grace and a substantial
mercy which brings salvation to the soul alone, this were the better life which we now enjoy
whole and entire; whereas to rise again but in part will be a chastisement, not a liberation.
The proof of the perfect goodness is, that man, after his rescue, should be delivered from
the domicile and power of the malignant deity unto the protection of the most good and
merciful God. Poor dupe of Marcion, fever2634 is hard upon you; and your painful flesh

not also in the present, that it may be perfectly wrought? Far different is our condition in
the sight of Him who is the Author, the Judge, the injured2635 Head of our race! You display
Him as a merely good God; but you are unable to prove that He is perfectly good, because

<head>Chapter XXV.—God is Not a Being of Simple Goodness; Other Attributes Belong
to Him. Marcion Shows Inconsistency in the Portraiture of His Simply Good
and Emotionless God.</head>
<p>As touching this question of goodness, we have in these outlines of our argument shown
it to be in no way compatible with Deity,—as being neither natural,2636 nor rational, nor
perfect, but wrong,2637 and unjust, and unworthy of the very name of goodness,—because,
as far as the congruity of the divine character is concerned, it cannot indeed be fitting that
that Being should be regarded as God who is alleged to have such a goodness, and that not
in a modified way, but simply and solely. For it is, furthermore, at this point quite open to
discussion, whether God ought to be regarded as a Being of simple goodness, to the exclusion
of all those other attributes,2638 sensations, and affections, which the Marcionites indeed
transfer from their god to the Creator, and which we acknowledge to be worthy characteristics
of the Creator too, but only because we consider Him to be God. Well, then, on this
ground we shall deny him to be God in whom all things are not to be found which befit the
Divine Being. If (Marcion) chose2639 to take any one of the school of Epicurus, and entitle
him God in the name of Christ, on the ground that what is happy and incorruptible can
bring no trouble either on itself or anything else (for Marcion, while poring over2640 this
opinion of the divine indifference, has removed from him all the severity and energy of the
judicial2641 character), it was his duty to have developed his conceptions into some imperturbable
and listless god (and then what could he have had in common with Christ, who
occasioned trouble both to the Jews by what He taught, and to Himself by what He felt?),
or else to have admitted that he was possessed of the same emotions as others2642 (and in
such case what would he have had to do with Epicurus, who was no friend2643 to either him
or Christians?). For that a being who in ages past2644 was in a quiescent state, not caring to
communicate any knowledge of himself by any work all the while, should come after so
long a time to entertain a concern for man’s salvation, of course by his own will,—did he

not by this very fact become susceptible of the impulse2645 of a new volition, so as palpably
to be open to all other emotions? But what volition is unaccompanied with the spur of desire?
2646 Who wishes for what he desires not? Moreover, care will be another companion
of the will. For who will wish for any object and desire to have it, without also caring to obtain
it? When, therefore, (Marcion’s god) felt both a will and a desire for man’s salvation, he
certainly occasioned some concern and trouble both to himself and others. This Marcion’s
theory suggests, though Epicurus demurs. For he2647 raised up an adversary against himself
in that very thing against which his will and desire, and care were directed,—whether it were
sin or death,—and more especially in their Tyrant and Lord, the Creator of man. Again,2648
nothing will ever run its course without hostile rivalry,2649 which shall not (itself) be without
a hostile aspect. In fact,2650 when willing, desiring, and caring to deliver man, (Marcion’s
god) already in the very act encounters a rival, both in Him from whom He effects the deliverance
(for of course2651 he means the liberation to be an opposition to Him), and also
in those things from which the deliverance is wrought (the intended liberation being to the
advantage of some other things). For it must needs be, that upon rivalry its own ancillary
passions2652 will be in attendance, against whatever objects its emulation is directed: anger,
discord, hatred, disdain, indignation, spleen, loathing, displeasure. Now, since all these
emotions are present to rivalry; since, moreover, the rivalry which arises in liberating man
excites them; and since, again, this deliverance of man is an operation of goodness, it follows
that this goodness avails nothing without its endowments,2653 that is to say, without those
sensations and affections whereby it carries out its purpose2654 against the Creator; so that
it cannot even in this be ruled2655 to be irrational, as if it were wanting in proper sensations
and affections. These points we shall have to insist on2656 much more fully, when we come
to plead the cause of the Creator, where they will also incur our condemnation.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—In the Attribute of Justice, Marcion’s God is Hopelessly Weak and
Ungodlike. He Dislikes Evil, But Does Not Punish Its Perpetration.</head>
<p>But it is here sufficient that the extreme perversity of their god is proved from the mere
exposition of his lonely goodness, in which they refuse to ascribe to him such emotions of
mind as they censure in the Creator. Now, if he is susceptible of no feeling of rivalry, or
anger, or damage, or injury, as one who refrains from exercising judicial power, I cannot
tell how any system of discipline—and that, too, a plenary one—can be consistent in him.
For how is it possible that he should issue commands, if he does not mean to execute them;
or forbid sins, if he intends not to punish them, but rather to decline the functions of the
judge, as being a stranger to all notions of severity and judicial chastisement? For why does
he forbid the commission of that which he punishes not when perpetrated? It would have
been far more right, if he had not forbidden what he meant not to punish, than that he
should punish what he had not forbidden. Nay, it was his duty even to have permitted what
he was about to prohibit in so unreasonable a way, as to annex no penalty to the offence.2657
For even now that is tacitly permitted which is forbidden without any infliction of vengeance.
Besides, he only forbids the commission of that which he does not like to have done. Most
listless, therefore, is he, since he takes no offence at the doing of what he dislikes to be done,
although displeasure ought to be the companion of his violated will. Now, if he is offended,
he ought to be angry; if angry, he ought to inflict punishment. For such infliction is the just
fruit of anger, and anger is the debt of displeasure, and displeasure (as I have said) is the
companion of a violated will. However, he inflicts no punishment; therefore he takes no
offence.</p>
<p>He takes no offence, therefore his will is not wronged, although that is done which he
was unwilling to have done; and the transgression is now committed with the acquiescence
of2658 his will, because whatever offends not the will is not committed against the will. Now,
if this is to be the principle of the divine virtue or goodness, to be unwilling indeed that a
thing be done and to prohibit it, and yet not be moved by its commission, we then allege
that he has been moved already when he declared his unwillingness; and that it is vain for
him not to be moved by the accomplishment of a thing after being moved at the possibility
thereof, when he willed it not to be done. For he prohibited it by his not willing it. Did he
not therefore do a judicial act, when he declared his unwillingness, and consequent prohibition
of it? For he judged that it ought not to be done, and he deliberately declared2659 that
it should be forbidden. Consequently by this time even he performs the part of a judge. If
it is unbecoming for God to discharge a judicial function, or at least only so far becoming

<pb n="628"/>
that He may merely declare His unwillingness, and pronounce His prohibition, then He
may not even punish for an offence when it is committed. Now, nothing is so unworthy of
the Divine Being as not to execute retribution on what He has disliked and forbidden. First,
He owes the infliction of chastisement to whatever sentence or law He promulges, for the
vindication of His authority and the maintenance of submission to it; secondly, because
hostile opposition is inevitable to what He has disliked to be done, and by that dislike forbidden.
Moreover, it would be a more unworthy course for God to spare the evil-doer than
to punish him, especially in the most good and holy God, who is not otherwise fully good
than as the enemy of evil, and that to such a degree as to display His love of good by the
hatred of evil, and to fulfil His defence of the former by the extirpation of the latter.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVII.—Dangerous Effects to Religion and Morality of the Doctrine of So
Weak a God.</head>
<p>Again, he plainly judges evil by not willing it, and condemns it by prohibiting it; while,
on the other hand, he acquits it by not avenging it, and lets it go free by not punishing it.
What a prevaricator of truth is such a god! What a dissembler with his own decision! Afraid
to condemn what he really condemns, afraid to hate what he does not love, permitting that
to be done which he does not allow, choosing to indicate what he dislikes rather than deeply
examine it! This will turn out an imaginary goodness, a phantom of discipline, perfunctory
in duty, careless in sin. Listen, ye sinners; and ye who have not yet come to this, hear, that
you may attain to such a pass! A better god has been discovered, who never takes offence,
is never angry, never inflicts punishment, who has prepared no fire in hell, no gnashing of
teeth in the outer darkness! He is purely and simply good. He indeed forbids all delinquency,
but only in word. He is in you, if you are willing to pay him homage,2660 for the sake of
appearances, that you may seem to honour God; for your fear he does not want. And so
satisfied are the Marcionites with such pretences, that they have no fear of their god at all.
They say it is only a bad man who will be feared, a good man will be loved. Foolish man,
do you say that he whom you call Lord ought not to be feared, whilst the very title you give
him indicates a power which must itself be feared? But how are you going to love, without
some fear that you do not love? Surely (such a god) is neither your Father, towards whom
your love for duty’s sake should be consistent with fear because of His power; nor your
proper2661 Lord, whom you should love for His humanity and fear as your teacher.2662
Kidnappers2663 indeed are loved after this fashion, but they are not feared. For power will
not be feared, except it be just and regular, although it may possibly be loved even when
corrupt: for it is by allurement that it stands, not by authority; by flattery, not by proper influence.
And what can be more direct flattery than not to punish sins? Come, then, if you
do not fear God as being good, why do you not boil over into every kind of lust, and so
realize that which is, I believe, the main enjoyment of life to all who fear not God? Why do
you not frequent the customary pleasures of the maddening circus, the bloodthirsty arena,

fear Who forbids the sin. This is quite a different matter from that obsequious homage you
pay to the god whom you do not fear, which is identical in perversity indeed to is own
conduct, in prohibiting a thing without annexing the sanction of punishment. Still more
vainly do they act, who when asked, What is to become of every sinner in that great day?
reply, that he is to be cast away out of sight. Is not even this a question of judicial determination?
He is adjudged to deserve rejection, and that by a sentence of condemnation; unless
the sinner is cast away forsooth for his salvation, that even a leniency like this may fall in
consistently with the character of your most good and excellent god! And what will it be to
be cast away, but to lose that which a man was in the way of obtaining, were it not for his
rejection—that is, his salvation? Therefore his being cast away will involve the forfeiture of
salvation; and this sentence cannot possibly be passed upon him, except by an angry and
offended authority, who is also the punisher of sin—that is, by a judge.</p>

No Gift of the Spirit.</head>
<p>And what will happen to him after he is cast away? He will, they say, be thrown into the
Creator’s fire. Then has no remedial provision been made (by their god) for the purpose
of banishing those that sin against him, without resorting to the cruel measure of delivering
them over to the Creator? And what will the Creator then do? I suppose He will prepare
for them a hell doubly charged with brimstone,2666 as for blasphemers against Himself; except
indeed their god in his zeal, as perhaps might happen, should show clemency to his rival’s
revolted subjects. Oh, what a god is this! everywhere perverse; nowhere rational; in all cases
vain; and therefore a nonentity!2667—in whose state, and condition, and nature, and every
appointment, I see no coherence and consistency; no, not even in the very sacrament of his
faith! For what end does baptism serve, according to him? If the remission of sins, how will
he make it evident that he remits sins, when he affords no evidence that he retains them?
Because he would retain them, if he performed the functions of a judge. If deliverance from
death, how could he deliver from death, who has not delivered to death? For he must have
delivered the sinner to death, if he had from the beginning condemned sin. If the regeneration
of man, how can he regenerate, who has never generated? For the repetition of an act is
impossible to him, by whom nothing any time has been ever done. If the bestowal of the
Holy Ghost, how will he bestow the Spirit, who did not at first impart the life? For the life
is in a sense the supplement2668 of the Spirit. He therefore seals man, who had never been
unsealed2669 in respect of him;2670 washes man, who had never been defiled so far as he
was concerned;2671 and into this sacrament of salvation wholly plunges that flesh which is
beyond the pale of salvation!2672 No farmer will irrigate ground that will yield him no fruit
in return, except he be as stupid as Marcion’s god. Why then impose sanctity upon our most

<head>Chapter XXIX.—Marcion Forbids Marriage. Tertullian Eloquently Defends It as
Holy, and Carefully Discriminates Between Marcion’s Doctrine and His Own
Montanism.</head>
<p>The flesh is not, according to Marcion, immersed in the water of the sacrament, unless
it be2673 in virginity, widowhood, or celibacy, or has purchased by divorce a title to baptism,
as if even generative impotents2674 did not all receive their flesh from nuptial union. Now,
such a scheme as this must no doubt involve the proscription of marriage. Let us see, then,
whether it be a just one: not as if we aimed at destroying the happiness of sanctity, as do
certain Nicolaitans in their maintenance of lust and luxury, but as those who have come to
the knowledge of sanctity, and pursue it and prefer it, without detriment, however, to marriage;
not as if we superseded a bad thing by a good, but only a good thing by a better. For
we do not reject marriage, but simply refrain from it.2675 Nor do we prescribe sanctity2676
as the rule, but only recommend it, observing it as a good, yea, even the better state, if each
man uses it carefully2677 according to his ability; but at the same time earnestly vindicating
marriage, whenever hostile attacks are made against it is a polluted thing, to the disparagement
of the Creator. For He bestowed His blessing on matrimony also, as on an honourable
estate, for the increase of the human race; as He did indeed on the whole of His creation,2678
for wholesome and good uses. Meats and drinks are not on this account to be condemned,
because, when served up with too exquisite a daintiness, they conduce to gluttony; nor is
raiment to be blamed, because, when too costlily adorned, it becomes inflated with vanity
and pride. So, on the same principle, the estate of matrimony is not to be refused, because,
when enjoyed without moderation, it is fanned into a voluptuous flame. There is a great
difference between a cause and a fault,2679 between a state and its excess. Consequently it
is not an institution of this nature that is to be blamed, but the extravagant use of it; according
to the judgment of its founder Himself, who not only said, “Be fruitful, and multiply,”2680

but also, “Thou shalt not commit adultery,” and, “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s
wife;”2681 and who threatened with death the unchaste, sacrilegious, and monstrous abomination
both of adultery and unnatural sin with man and beast.2682 Now, if any limitation
is set to marrying—such as the spiritual rule,2683 which prescribes but one marriage under
the Christian obedience,2684 maintained by the authority of the Paraclete,2685—it will be
His prerogative to fix the limit Who had once been diffuse in His permission; His to gather,
Who once scattered; His to cut down the tree, Who planted it; His to reap the harvest, Who
sowed the seed; His to declare, “It remaineth that they who have wives be as though they
had none,”2686 Who once said, “Be fruitful, and multiply;” His the end to Whom belonged
the beginning. Nevertheless, the tree is not cut down as if it deserved blame; nor is the corn
reaped, as if it were to be condemned,—but simply because their time is come. So likewise
the state of matrimony does not require the hook and scythe of sanctity, as if it were evil;
but as being ripe for its discharge, and in readiness for that sanctity which will in the long
run bring it a plenteous crop by its reaping. For this leads me to remark of Marcion’s god,
that in reproaching marriage as an evil and unchaste thing, he is really prejudicing the cause
of that very sanctity which he seems to serve. For he destroys the material on which it subsists;
if there is to be no marriage, there is no sanctity. All proof of abstinence is lost when
excess is impossible; for sundry things have thus their evidence in their contraries. Just as
“strength is made perfect in weakness,”2687 so likewise is continence made manifest by the
permission to marry. Who indeed will be called continent, if that be taken away which gives
him the opportunity of pursuing a life of continence? What room for temperance in appetite
does famine give? What repudiation of ambitious projects does poverty afford? What
bridling of lust can the eunuch merit? To put a complete stop, however, to the sowing of
the human race, may, for aught I know, be quite consistent for Marcion’s most good and
excellent god. For how could he desire the salvation of man, whom he forbids to be born,
when he takes away that institution from which his birth arises? How will he find any one
on whom to set the mark of his goodness, when he suffers him not to come into existence?
How is it possible to love him whose origin he hates? Perhaps he is afraid of a redundant
population, lest he should be weary in liberating so many; lest he should have to make many

cruelty of Pharaoh, which slew its victims at their birth, will not prove to be more inhuman
in comparison.2688 For while he destroyed lives, our heretic’s god refuses to give them: the
one removes from life, the other admits none to it. There is no difference in either as to
their homicide—man is slain by both of them; by the former just after birth, by the latter as
yet unborn. Thanks should we owe thee, thou god of our heretic, hadst thou only checked2689
the dispensation of the Creator in uniting male and female; for from such a union indeed
has thy Marcion been born! Enough, however, of Marcion’s god, who is shown to have
absolutely no existence at all, both by our definitions2690 of the one only Godhead, and the
condition of his attributes.2691 The whole course, however, of this little work aims directly

<p>The occasion of reproducing this little work, the fortunes of which we noticed in the
preface of our first book, has furnished us with the opportunity of distinguishing, in our
treatment of the subject of two Gods in opposition to Marcion, each of them with a description
and section of his own, according to the division of the subject-matter, defining one of
the gods to have no existence at all, and maintaining of the Other that He is rightly2693 God;
thus far keeping pace with the heretic of Pontus, who has been pleased to admit one unto,
and exclude the other.2694 For he could not build up his mendacious scheme without pulling
down the system of truth. He found it necessary to demolish2695 some other thing, in order
to build up the theory which he wished. This process, however, is like constructing a house
without preparing suitable materials.2696 The discussion ought to have been directed to this
point alone, that he is no god who supersedes the Creator. Then, when the false god had
been excluded by certain rules which prescriptively settle what is the character of the One
only perfect Divinity, there could have remained no longer any question as to the true God.
The proof of His existence would have been clear, and that, too, amid the failure of all
evidence in support of any other god; and still clearer2697 would have seemed the point as
to the honour in which He ought without controversy to be held: that He ought to be worshipped
rather than judged; served reverentially rather than handled critically, or even
dreaded for His severity. For what was more fully needed by man than a careful estimate

<head>Chapter II.—The True Doctrine of God the Creator. The Heretics Pretended to a
Knowledge of the Divine Being, Opposed to and Subversive of Revelation. God’s
Nature and Ways Past Human Discovery. Adam’s Heresy.</head>
<p>We have now, then, cleared our way to the contemplation of the Almighty God, the
Lord and Maker of the universe. His greatness, as I think, is shown in this, that from the
beginning He made Himself known: He never hid Himself, but always shone out brightly,
even before the time of Romulus, to say nothing of that of Tiberius; with the exception indeed
that the heretics, and they alone, know Him not, although they take such pains about Him.
They on this account suppose that another god must be assumed to exist, because they are
more able to censure than deny Him whose existence is so evident, deriving all their thoughts
about God from the deductions of sense; just as if some blind man, or a man of imperfect
vision,2700 chose to assume some other sun of milder and healthier ray, because he sees not
that which is the object of sight.2701 There is, O man, but one sun which rules2702 this world
and even when you think otherwise of him, he is best and useful; and although to you he
may seem too fierce and baneful, or else, it may be, too sordid and corrupt, he yet is true to
the laws of his own existence. Unable as you are to see through those laws, you would be
equally impotent to bear the rays of any other sun, were there one, however great and good.
Now, you whose sight is defective2703 in respect of the inferior god, what is your view of
the sublimer One? Really you are too lenient2704 to your weakness; and set not yourself to
the proof2705 of things, holding God to be certainly, undoubtedly, and therefore sufficiently
known, the very moment you have discovered Him to exist, though you know Him not except
on the side where He has willed His proofs to lie. But you do not even deny God intelligently,
2706 you treat of Him ignorantly;2707 nay, you accuse Him with a semblance of intelligence,
2708 whom if you did but know Him, you would never accuse, nay, never treat of.2709
You give Him His name indeed, but you deny the essential truth of that name, that is, the
greatness which is called God; not acknowledging it to be such as, were it possible for it to

have been known to man in every respect,2710 would not be greatness. Isaiah even so early,
with the clearness of an apostle, foreseeing the thoughts of heretical hearts, asked, “Who
hath known the mind of the Lord? For who hath been His counsellor? With whom took He
counsel?…or who taught Him knowledge, and showed to Him the way of understanding?”
2711 With whom the apostle agreeing exclaims, “Oh the depth of the riches both of the
wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past
finding out!”2712 “His judgments unsearchable,” as being those of God the Judge; and “His
ways past finding out,” as comprising an understanding and knowledge which no man has
ever shown to Him, except it may be those critics of the Divine Being, who say, God ought
not to have been this,2713 and He ought rather to have been that; as if any one knew what
is in God, except the Spirit of God.2714 Moreover, having the spirit of the world, and “in
the wisdom of God by wisdom knowing not God,”2715 they seem to themselves to be
wiser2716 than God; because, as the wisdom of the world is foolishness with God, so also
the wisdom of God is folly in the world’s esteem. We, however, know that “the foolishness
of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.”2717 Accordingly,
God is then especially great, when He is small2718 to man; then especially good, when not
good in man’s judgment; then especially unique, when He seems to man to be two or more.
Now, if from the very first “the natural man, not receiving the things of the Spirit of God,”2719
has deemed God’s law to be foolishness, and has therefore neglected to observe it; and as a
further consequence, by his not having faith, “even that which he seemeth to have hath been
taken from him”2720—such as the grace of paradise and the friendship of God, by means
of which he might have known all things of God, if he had continued in his obedience—what
wonder is it, if he,2721 reduced to his material nature, and banished to the toil of tilling the
ground, has in his very labour, downcast and earth-gravitating as it was, handed on that
earth-derived spirit of the world to his entire race, wholly natural2722 and heretical as it is,

<head>Chapter III.—God Known by His Works. His Goodness Shown in His Creative Energy;
But Everlasting in Its Nature; Inherent in God, Previous to All Exhibition
of It. The First Stage of This Goodness Prior to Man.</head>
<p>It will therefore be right for us, as we enter on the examination of the known God, when
the question arises, in what condition He is known to us, to begin with His works, which
are prior to man; so that His goodness, being discovered immediately along with Himself,
and then constituted and prescriptively settled, may suggest to us some sense whereby we
may understand how the subsequent order of things came about. The disciples of Marcion,
moreover, may possibly be able, while recognising the goodness of our God, to learn how
worthy it is likewise of the Divine Being, on those very grounds whereby we have proved it
to be unworthy in the case of their god. Now this very point,2725 which is a material one in
their scheme,2726 Marcion did not find in any other god, but eliminated it for himself out
of his own god. The first goodness, then,2727 was that of the Creator, whereby God was
unwilling to remain hidden for ever; in other words, (unwilling) that there should not be a
something by which God should become known. For what, indeed, is so good as the
knowledge and fruition2728 of God? Now, although it did not transpires that this was good,
because as yet there existed nothing to which it could transpire,2729 yet God foreknew what
good would eventually transpire, and therefore He set Himself about developing2730 His
own perfect goodness, for the accomplishment of the good which was to transpire; not, indeed,
a sudden goodness issuing in some accidental boon2731 or in some excited impulse,2732
such as must be dated simply from the moment when it began to operate. For if it did itself
produce its own beginning when it began to operate, it had not, in fact, a beginning itself
when it acted. When, however, an initial act had been once done by it, the scheme of temporal
seasons began, for distinguishing and noting which, the stars and luminaries of
heaven were arranged in their order. “Let them be,” says God, “for seasons, and for days,
and years.”2733 Previous, then, to this temporal course, (the goodness) which created time

had not time; nor before that beginning which the same goodness originated, had it a beginning.
Being therefore without all order of a beginning, and all mode of time, it will be
reckoned to possess an age, measureless in extent2734 and endless in duration;2735 nor will
it be possible to regard it as a sudden or adventitious or impulsive emotion, because it has
nothing to occasion such an estimate of itself; in other words, no sort of temporal sequence.
It must therefore be accounted an eternal attribute, inbred in God,2736 and everlasting,2737
and on this account worthy of the Divine Being, putting to shame for ever2738 the benevolence
of Marcion’s god, subsequent as he is to (I will not say) all beginnings and times, but
to the very malignity of the Creator, if indeed malignity could possibly have been found in

<p>The goodness of God having, therefore, provided man for the pursuit of the knowledge
of Himself, added this to its original notification,2739 that it first prepared a habitation for
him, the vast fabric (of the world) to begin with, and then afterwards2740 the vaster one (of
a higher world,2741) that he might on a great as well as on a smaller stage practise and advance
in his probation, and so be promoted from the good which God had given him, that is, from
his high position, to God’s best; that is, to some higher abode.2742 In this good work God
employs a most excellent minister, even His own Word. “My heart,” He says, “hath emitted
my most excellent Word.”2743 Let Marcion take hence his first lesson on the noble fruit of
this truly most excellent tree. But, like a most clumsy clown, he has grafted a good branch
on a bad stock. The sapling, however, of his blasphemy shall be never strong: it shall wither
with its planter, and thus shall be manifested the nature of the good tree. Look at the total
result: how fruitful was the Word! God issued His fiat, and it was done: God also saw that
it was good;2744 not as if He were ignorant of the good until He saw it; but because it was
good, He therefore saw it, and honoured it, and set His seal upon it; and consummated2745
the goodness of His works by His vouchsafing to them that contemplation. Thus God blessed
what He made good, in order that He might commend Himself to you as whole and perfect,

good both in word and act.2746 As yet the Word knew no malediction, because He was a
stranger to malefaction.2747 We shall see what reasons required this also of God. Meanwhile
the world consisted of all things good, plainly foreshowing how much good was preparing
for him for whom all this was provided. Who indeed was so worthy of dwelling amongst
the works of God, as he who was His own image and likeness? That image was wrought out
by a goodness even more operative than its wont,2748 with no imperious word, but with
friendly hand preceded by an almost affable2749 utterance: “Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness.”2750 Goodness spake the word; Goodness formed man of the dust of the
ground into so great a substance of the flesh, built up out of one material with so many
qualities; Goodness breathed into him a soul, not dead but living. Goodness gave him
dominion2751 over all things, which he was to enjoy and rule over, and even give names to.
In addition to this, Goodness annexed pleasures2752 to man so that, while master of the
whole world,2753 he might tarry among higher delights, being translated into paradise, out
of the world into the Church.2754 The self-same Goodness provided also a help meet for
him, that there might be nothing in his lot that was not good. For, said He, that the man be
alone is not good.2755 He knew full well what a blessing to him would be the sex of Mary,2756
and also of the Church. The law, however, which you find fault with,2757 and wrest into a
subject of contention, was imposed on man by Goodness, aiming at his happiness, that he
might cleave to God, and so not show himself an abject creature rather than a free one, nor
reduce himself to the level of the other animals, his subjects, which were free from God, and
exempt from all tedious subjection;2758 but might, as the sole human being, boast that he

alone was worthy of receiving laws from God; and as a rational being, capable of intelligence
and knowledge, be restrained within the bounds of rational liberty, subject to Him who had
subjected all things unto him. To secure the observance of this law, Goodness likewise took
counsel by help of this sanction: “In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely
die.”2759 For it was a most benignant act of His thus to point out the issues of transgression,
lest ignorance of the danger should encourage a neglect of obedience. Now, since2760 it was
given as a reason previous to the imposition of the law, it also amounted to a motive for
subsequently observing it, that a penalty was annexed to its transgression; a penalty, indeed,
which He who proposed it was still unwilling that it should be incurred. Learn then the
goodness of our God amidst these things and up to this point; learn it from His excellent
works, from His kindly blessings, from His indulgent bounties, from His gracious providences,

<p>Now then, ye dogs, whom the apostle puts outside,2761 and who yelp at the God of truth,
let us come to your various questions. These are the bones of contention, which you are
perpetually gnawing! If God is good, and prescient of the future, and able to avert evil, why
did He permit man, the very image and likeness of Himself, and, by the origin of his soul,
His own substance too, to be deceived by the devil, and fall from obedience of the law into
death? For if He had been good, and so unwilling that such a catastrophe should happen,
and prescient, so as not to be ignorant of what was to come to pass, and powerful enough
to hinder its occurrence, that issue would never have come about, which should be impossible
under these three conditions of the divine greatness. Since, however, it has occurred, the
contrary proposition is most certainly true, that God must be deemed neither good, nor
prescient, nor powerful. For as no such issue could have happened had God been such as
He is reputed—good, and prescient, and mighty—so has this issue actually happened, because
He is not such a God. In reply, we must first vindicate those attributes in the Creator which
are called in question—namely, His goodness and foreknowledge, and power. But I shall
not linger long over this point2762 for Christ’s own definition2763 comes to our aid at once.
From works must proofs be obtained. The Creator’s works testify at once to His goodness,
since they are good, as we have shown, and to His power, since they are mighty, and spring
indeed out of nothing. And even if they were made out of some (previous) matter, as some2764
will have it, they are even thus out of nothing, because they were not what they are. In short,
both they are great because they are good; and2765 God is likewise mighty, because all things
are His own, whence He is almighty. But what shall I say of His prescience, which has for
its witnesses as many prophets as it inspired? After all,2766 what title to prescience do we
look for in the Author of the universe, since it was by this very attribute that He foreknew
all things when He appointed them their places, and appointed them their places when He
foreknew them? There is sin itself. If He had not foreknown this, He would not have proclaimed
a caution against it under the penalty of death. Now if there were in God such attributes
as must have rendered it both impossible and improper for any evil to have happened

to man,2767 and yet evil did occur, let us consider man’s condition also—whether it were
not, in fact, rather the cause why that came to pass which could not have happened through
God. I find, then, that man was by God constituted free, master of his own will and power;
indicating the presence of God’s image and likeness in him by nothing so well as by this
constitution of his nature. For it was not by his face, and by the lineaments of his body,
though they were so varied in his human nature, that he expressed his likeness to the form
of God; but he showed his stamp2768 in that essence which he derived from God Himself
(that is, the spiritual,2769 which answered to the form of God), and in the freedom and
power of his will. This his state was confirmed even by the very law which God then imposed
upon him. For a law would not be imposed upon one who had it not in his power to render
that obedience which is due to law; nor again, would the penalty of death be threatened
against sin, if a contempt of the law were impossible to man in the liberty of his will. So in
the Creator’s subsequent laws also you will find, when He sets before man good and evil,
life and death, that the entire course of discipline is arranged in precepts by God’s calling
men from sin, and threatening and exhorting them; and this on no other ground than2770
that man is free, with a will either for obedience or resistance.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—This Liberty Vindicated in Respect of Its Original Creation; Suitable
Also for Exhibiting the Goodness and the Purpose of God. Reward and Punishment
Impossible If Man Were Good or Evil Through Necessity and Not Choice.</head>
<p>But although we shall be understood, from our argument, to be only so affirming man’s
unshackled power over his will, that what happens to him should be laid to his own charge,
and not to God’s, yet that you may not object, even now, that he ought not to have been so
constituted, since his liberty and power of will might turn out to be injurious, I will first of
all maintain that he was rightly so constituted, that I may with the greater confidence commend
both his actual constitution, and the additional fact of its being worthy of the Divine
Being; the cause which led to man’s being created with such a constitution being shown to
be the better one. Moreover, man thus constituted will be protected by both the goodness
of God and by His purpose,2771 both of which are always found in concert in our God. For
His purpose is no purpose without goodness; nor is His goodness goodness without a purpose,
except forsooth in the case of Marcion’s god, who is purposelessly2772 good, as we
have shown.2773 Well, then, it was proper that God should be known; it was no doubt2774
a good and reasonable2775 thing. Proper also was it that there should be something worthy
of knowing God. What could be found so worthy as the image and likeness of God? This
also was undoubtedly good and reasonable. Therefore it was proper that (he who is) the
image and likeness of God should be formed with a free will and a mastery of himself;2776
so that this very thing—namely, freedom of will and self-command—might be reckoned as
the image and likeness of God in him. For this purpose such an essence2777 was adapted2778
to man as suited this character,2779 even the afflatus of the Deity, Himself free and uncontrolled.
2780 But if you will take some other view of the case,2781 how came it to pass2782 that

man, when in possession of the whole world, did not above all things reign in self-possession2783—
a master over others, a slave to himself? The goodness of God, then, you can
learn from His gracious gift2784 to man, and His purpose from His disposal of all things.2785
At present, let God’s goodness alone occupy our attention, that which gave so large a gift to
man, even the liberty of his will. God’s purpose claims some other opportunity of treatment,
offering as it does instruction of like import. Now, God alone is good by nature. For He,
who has that which is without beginning, has it not by creation,2786 but by nature. Man,
however, who exists entirely by creation, having a beginning, along with that beginning
obtained the form in which he exists; and thus he is not by nature disposed to good, but by
creation, not having it as his own attribute to be good, because, (as we have said,) it is not
by nature, but by creation, that he is disposed to good, according to the appointment of his
good Creator, even the Author of all good. In order, therefore, that man might have a
goodness of his own,2787 bestowed2788 on him by God, and there might be henceforth in
man a property, and in a certain sense a natural attribute of goodness, there was assigned
to him in the constitution of his nature, as a formal witness2789 of the goodness which God
bestowed upon him, freedom and power of the will, such as should cause good to be performed
spontaneously by man, as a property of his own, on the ground that no less than
this2790 would be required in the matter of a goodness which was to be voluntarily exercised
by him, that is to say, by the liberty of his will, without either favour or servility to the constitution
of his nature, so that man should be good2791 just up to this point,2792 if he should
display his goodness in accordance with his natural constitution indeed, but still as the result
of his will, as a property of his nature; and, by a similar exercise of volition,2793 should show
himself to be too strong2794 in defence against evil also (for even this God, of course, foresaw),
being free, and master of himself; because, if he were wanting in this prerogative of self-

mastery, so as to perform even good by necessity and not will, he would, in the helplessness
of his servitude, become subject to the usurpation of evil, a slave as much to evil as to good.
Entire freedom of will, therefore, was conferred upon him in both tendencies; so that, as
master of himself, he might constantly encounter good by spontaneous observance of it,
and evil by its spontaneous avoidance; because, were man even otherwise circumstanced,
it was yet his bounden duty, in the judgment of God, to do justice according to the motions2795
of his will regarded, of course, as free. But the reward neither of good nor of evil
could be paid to the man who should be found to have been either good or evil through
necessity and not choice. In this really lay2796 the law which did not exclude, but rather
prove, human liberty by a spontaneous rendering of obedience, or a spontaneous commission
of iniquity; so patent was the liberty of man’s will for either issue. Since, therefore, both the
goodness and purpose of God are2797 discovered in the gift to man of freedom in his will,
it is not right, after ignoring the original definition of goodness and purpose which it was
necessary to determine previous to any discussion of the subject, on subsequent facts to
presume to say that God ought not in such a way to have formed man, because the issue
was other than what was assumed to be2798 proper for God. We ought rather,2799 after duly
considering that it behoved God so to create man, to leave this consideration unimpaired,
and to survey the other aspects of the case. It is, no doubt, an easy process for persons who
take offence at the fall of man, before they have looked into the facts of his creation, to impute
the blame of what happened to the Creator, without any examination of His purpose. To
conclude: the goodness of God, then fully considered from the beginning of His works, will
be enough to convince us that nothing evil could possibly have come forth from God; and
the liberty of man will, after a second thought,2800 show us that it alone is chargeable with
the fault which itself committed.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—If God Had Anyhow Checked Man’s Liberty, Marcion Would Have
Been Ready with Another and Opposite Cavil. Man’s Fall Foreseen by God.
Provision Made for It Remedially and Consistently with His Truth and Goodness.</head>
<p>By such a conclusion all is reserved2801 unimpaired to God; both His natural goodness,
and the purposes of His governance and foreknowledge, and the abundance of His power.
You ought, however, to deduct from God’s attributes both His supreme earnestness of
purpose2802 and most excellent truth in His whole creation, if you would cease to inquire
whether anything could have happened against the will of God. For, while holding this
earnestness and truth of the good God, which are indeed2803 capable of proof from the rational
creation, you will not wonder at the fact that God did not interfere to prevent the
occurrence of what He wished not to happen, in order that He might keep from harm what
He wished. For, since He had once for all allowed (and, as we have shown, worthily allowed)
to man freedom of will and mastery of himself, surely He from His very authority in creation
permitted these gifts to be enjoyed: to be enjoyed, too, so far as lay in Himself, according to
His own character as God, that is, for good (for who would permit anything hostile to
himself?); and, so far as lay in man, according to the impulses of his liberty (for who does
not, when giving anything to any one to enjoy, accompany the gift with a permission to
enjoy it with all his heart and will?). The necessary consequence,2804 therefore, was, that
God must separate from the liberty which He had once for all bestowed upon man (in other
words, keep within Himself), both His foreknowledge and power, through which He might
have prevented man’s falling into danger when attempting wrongly to enjoy his liberty.
Now, if He had interposed, He would have rescinded the liberty of man’s will, which He
had permitted with set purpose, and in goodness. But, suppose God had interposed; suppose
Him to have abrogated man’s liberty, by warning him from the tree, and keeping off the
subtle serpent from his interview with the woman; would not Marcion then exclaim, What
a frivolous, unstable, and faithless Lord, cancelling the gifts He had bestowed! Why did He
allow any liberty of will, if He afterwards withdrew it? Why withdraw it after allowing it?
Let Him choose where to brand Himself with error, either in His original constitution of
man, or in His subsequent abrogation thereof! If He had checked (man’s freedom), would
He not then seem to have been rather deceived, through want of foresight into the future?

things? God, however, did foreknow that man would make a bad use of his created constitution;
and yet what can be so worthy of God as His earnestness of purpose, and the truth
of His created works, be they what they may? Man must see, if he failed to make the most
of2805 the good gift he had received, how that he was himself guilty in respect of the law
which he did not choose to keep, and not that the Lawgiver was committing a fraud against
His own law, by not permitting its injunctions to be fulfilled. Whenever you are inclined to
indulge in such censure2806 (and it is the most becoming for you) against the Creator, recall
gently to your mind in His behalf2807 His earnestness, and endurance, and truth, in having
given completeness2808 to His creatures both as rational and good.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Man, Endued with Liberty, Superior to the Angels, Overcomes Even
the Angel Which Lured Him to His Fall, When Repentant and Resuming
Obedience to God.</head>
<p>For it was not merely that he might live the natural life that God had produced man,
but2809 that he should live virtuously, that is, in relation to God and to His law. Accordingly,
God gave him to live when he was formed into a living soul; but He charged him to live
virtuously when he was required to obey a law. So also God shows that man was not constituted
for death, by now wishing that he should be restored to life, preferring the sinner’s
repentance to his death.2810 As, therefore, God designed for man a condition of life, so man
brought on himself a state of death; and this, too, neither through infirmity nor through
ignorance, so that no blame can be imputed to the Creator. No doubt it was an angel who
was the seducer; but then the victim of that seduction was free, and master of himself; and
as being the image and likeness of God, was stronger than any angel; and as being, too, the
afflatus of the Divine Being, was nobler than that material spirit of which angels were made.
Who maketh, says he, His angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire.2811 He would not
have made all things subject to man, if he had been too weak for the dominion, and inferior
to the angels, to whom He assigned no such subjects; nor would He have put the burden of
law upon him, if he had been incapable of sustaining so great a weight; nor, again, would
He have threatened with the penalty of death a creature whom He knew to be guiltless on
the score of his helplessness: in short, if He had made him infirm, it would not have been
by liberty and independence of will, but rather by the withholding from him these endowments.
And thus it comes to pass, that even now also, the same human being, the same
substance of his soul, the same condition as Adam’s, is made conqueror over the same
devil by the self-same liberty and power of his will, when it moves in obedience to the laws
of God.2812</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—Another Cavil Answered, I.e., the Fall Imputable to God, Because
Man’s Soul is a Portion of the Spiritual Essence of the Creator. The Divine Afflatus
Not in Fault in the Sin of Man, But the Human Will Which Was Additional
to It.</head>
<p>But, you say, in what way soever the substance of the Creator is found to be susceptible
of fault, when the afflatus of God, that is to say, the soul,2813 offends in man, it cannot but
be that that fault of the portion is refferible to the original whole. Now, to meet this objection,
we must explain the nature2814 of the soul. We must at the outset hold fast the meaning of
the Greek scripture, which has afflatus, not spirit.2815 Some interpreters of the Greek, without
reflecting on the difference of the words, and careless about their exact meaning, put spirit
for afflatus; they thus afford to heretics an opportunity of tarnishing2816 the Spirit of God,
that is to say, God Himself, with default. And now comes the question. Afflatus, observe
then, is less than spirit, although it comes from spirit; it is the spirit’s gentle breeze,2817 but
it is not the spirit. Now a breeze is rarer than the wind; and although it proceeds from wind,
yet a breeze is not the wind. One may call a breeze the image of the spirit. In the same
manner, man is the image of God, that is, of spirit; for God is spirit. Afflatus is therefore the
image of the spirit. Now the image is not in any case equal to the very thing.2818 It is one
thing to be like the reality, and another thing to be the reality itself. So, although the afflatus
is the image of the spirit, it is yet not possible to compare the image of God in such a way,
that, because the reality—that is, the spirit, or in other words, the Divine Being—is faultless,
therefore the afflatus also, that is to say, the image, ought not by any possibility to have done
wrong. In this respect will the image be less than the reality, and the afflatus inferior to the
spirit, in that, while it possesses beyond doubt the true lineaments of divinity, such as an
immortal soul, freedom and its own mastery over itself, foreknowledge in a great degree,2819
reasonableness, capacity of understanding and knowledge, it is even in these respects an
image still, and never amounts to the actual power of Deity, nor to absolute exemption from

fault,—a property which is only conceded to God, that is, to the reality, and which is simply
incompatible with an image. An image, although it may express all the lineaments of the
reality, is yet wanting in its intrinsic power; it is destitute of motion. In like manner, the
soul, the image of the spirit, is unable to express the simple power thereof, that is to say, its
happy exemption from sinning.2820 Were it otherwise,2821 it would not be soul, but spirit;
not man, who received a soul, but God. Besides, to take another view of the matter,2822 not
everything which pertains to God will be regarded as God, so that you would not maintain
that His afflatus was God, that is, exempt from fault, because it is the breath of God. And
in an act of your own, such as blowing into a flute, you would not thereby make the flute
human, although it was your own human breath which you breathed into it, precisely as
God breathed of His own Spirit. In fact,2823 the Scripture, by expressly saying2824 that God
breathed into man’s nostrils the breath of life, and that man became thereby a living soul,
not a life-giving spirit, has distinguished that soul from the condition of the Creator. The
work must necessarily be distinct from the workman, and it is inferior to him. The pitcher
will not be the potter, although made by the potter; nor in like manner, will the afflatus,
because made by the spirit, be on that account the spirit. The soul has often been called by
the same name as the breath. You should also take care that no descent be made from the
breath to a still lower quality. So you have granted (you say) the infirmity of the soul, which
you denied before! Undoubtedly, when you demand for it an equality with God, that is, a
freedom from fault, I contend that it is infirm. But when the comparison is challenged with
an angel, I am compelled to maintain that the head over all things is the stronger of the two,
to whom the angels are ministers,2825 who is destined to be the judge of angels,2826 if he
shall stand fast in the law of God—an obedience which he refused at first. Now this disobedience2827
it was possible for the afflatus of God to commit: it was possible, but it was not
proper. The possibility lay in its slenderness of nature, as being the breath and not the spirit;
the impropriety, however, arose from its power of will, as being free, and not a slave. It was
furthermore assisted by the warning against committing sin under the threat of incurring
death, which was meant to be a support for its slender nature, and a direction for its liberty
of choice. So that the soul can no longer appear to have sinned, because it has an affinity

with God, that is to say, through the afflatus, but rather through that which was an addition
to its nature, that is, through its free-will, which was indeed given to it by God in accordance
with His purpose and reason, but recklessly employed2828 by man according as he chose.
This, then, being the case, the entire course2829 of God’s action is purged from all imputation
to evil. For the liberty of the will will not retort its own wrong on Him by whom it was bestowed,
but on him by whom it was improperly used. What is the evil, then, which you want
to impute to the Creator? If it is man’s sin, it will not be God’s fault, because it is man’s
doing; nor is that Being to be regarded as the author of the sin, who turns out to be its forbidder,
nay, its condemner. If death is the evil, death will not give the reproach of being its
own author to Him who threatened it, but to him who despised it. For by his contempt he
introduced it, which assuredly2830 would not have appeared had man not despised it.</p>

Vanquished in a Conflict on His Own Ground.</head>
<p>If, however, you choose to transfer the account2831 of evil from man to the devil as the
instigator of sin, and in this way, too, throw the blame on the Creator, inasmuch as He created
the devil,—for He maketh those spiritual beings, the angels—then it will follow that2832
what was made, that is to say, the angel, will belong to Him who made it; while that which
was not made by God, even the devil, or accuser,2833 cannot but have been made by itself;
and this by false detraction2834 from God: first, how that God had forbidden them to eat of
every tree; then, with the pretence that they should not die if they ate; thirdly, as if God
grudged them the property of divinity. Now, whence originated this malice of lying and
deceit towards man, and slandering of God? Most certainly not from God, who made the
angel good after the fashion of His good works. Indeed, before he became the devil, he
stands forth the wisest of creatures; and2835 wisdom is no2836 evil. If you turn to the
prophecy of Ezekiel, you will at once perceive that this angel was both by creation good and
by choice corrupt. For in the person of the prince of Tyre it is said in reference to the devil:
“Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Son of man, take up a lamentation
upon the king of Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord God: Thou sealest up the
sum, full of wisdom, perfect in beauty” (this belongs to him as the highest of the angels, the
archangel, the wisest of all); “amidst the delights of the paradise of thy God wast thou born”
(for it was there, where God had made the angels in a shape which resembled the figure of
animals). “Every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, the topaz, and the diamond,
the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle; and with
gold hast thou filled thy barns and thy treasuries. From the day when thou wast created,
when I set thee, a cherub, upon the holy mountain of God, thou wast in the midst of stones

either born in the paradise of God, not even Adam himself, who was rather translated
thither; nor placed with a cherub upon God’s holy mountain, that is to say, in the heights
of heaven, from which the Lord testifies that Satan fell; nor detained amongst the stones of
fire, and the flashing rays of burning constellations, whence Satan was cast down like lightning.
2838 No, it is none else than the very author of sin who was denoted in the person of a
sinful man: he was once irreproachable, at the time of his creation, formed for good by God,
as by the good Creator of irreproachable creatures, and adorned with every angelic glory,
and associated with God, good with the Good; but afterwards of his own accord removed
to evil. From the day when thine iniquities,2839 says he, were discovered,—attributing to him
those injuries wherewith he injured man when he was expelled from his allegiance to
God,—even from that time did he sin, when he propagated his sin, and thereby plied “the
abundance of his merchandise,” that is, of his Wickedness, even the tale2840 of his transgressions,
because he was himself as a spirit no less (than man) created, with the faculty of freewill.
For God would in nothing fail to endow a being who was to be next to Himself with
a liberty of this kind. Nevertheless, by precondemning him, God testified that he had departed
from the condition2841 of his created nature, through his own lusting after the wickedness
which was spontaneously conceived within him; and at the same time, by conceding a permission
for the operation of his designs, He acted consistently with the purpose of His own
goodness, deferring the devil’s destruction for the self-same reason as He postponed the
restitution of man. For He afforded room for a conflict, wherein man might crush his enemy
with the same freedom of his will as had made him succumb to him (proving that the fault
was all his own, not God’s), and so worthily recover his salvation by a victory; wherein also
the devil might receive a more bitter punishment, through being vanquished by him whom
he had previously injured; and wherein God might be discovered to be so much the more
good, as waiting2842 for man to return from his present life to a more glorious paradise,
with a right to pluck of the tree of life.2843</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—If, After Man’s Sin, God Exercised His Attribute of Justice and Judgment,
This Was Compatible with His Goodness, and Enhances the True Idea of
the Perfection of God’s Character.</head>
<p>Up to the fall of man, therefore, from the beginning God was simply good; after that
He became a judge both severe and, as the Marcionites will have it, cruel. Woman is at once
condemned to bring forth in sorrow, and to serve her husband,2844 although before she had
heard without pain the increase of her race proclaimed with the blessing, Increase and
multiply, and although she had been destined to be a help and not a slave to her male partner.
Immediately the earth is also cursed,2845 which before was blessed. Immediately spring up
briers and thorns, where once had grown grass, and herbs, and fruitful trees. Immediately
arise sweat and labour for bread, where previously on every tree was yielded spontaneous
food and untilled2846 nourishment. Thenceforth it is “man to the ground,” and not as before,
“from the ground”; to death thenceforth, but before, to life; thenceforth with coats of skins,
but before, nakedness without a blush. Thus God’s prior goodness was from2847 nature, His
subsequent severity from2848 a cause. The one was innate, the other accidental; the one His
own, the other adapted;2849 the one issuing from Him, the other admitted by Him. But then
nature could not have rightly permitted His goodness to have gone on inoperative, nor the
cause have allowed His severity to have escaped in disguise or concealment. God provided
the one for Himself, the other for the occasion.2850 You should now set about showing also
that the position of a judge is allied with evil, who have been dreaming of another god as a
purely good one—solely because you cannot understand the Deity to be a judge; although
we have proved God to be also a judge. Or if not a judge, at any rate a perverse and useless
originator of a discipline which is not to be vindicated—in other words, not to be judged.
You do not, however, disprove God’s being a judge, who have no proof to show that He is
a judge. You will undoubtedly have to accuse justice herself, which provides the judge, or
else to reckon her among the species of evil, that is, to add injustice to the titles of goodness.
But then justice is an evil, if injustice is a good. And yet you are forced to declare injustice
to be one of the worst of things, and by the same rule are constrained to class justice amongst
the most excellent. Since there is nothing hostile2851 to evil which is not good, and no enemy

of good which is not evil. It follows, then, that as injustice is an evil, so in the same degree
is justice a good. Nor should it be regarded as simply a species of goodness, but as the
practical observance2852 of it, because goodness (unless justice be so controlled as to be just)
will not be goodness, if it be unjust. For nothing is good which is unjust; while everything,
on the other hand, which is just is good.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—The Attributes of Goodness and Justice Should Not Be Separated.
They are Compatible in the True God. The Function of Justice in the Divine
Being Described.</head>
<p>Since, therefore, there is this union and agreement between goodness and justice, you
cannot prescribe2853 their separation. With what face will you determine the separation of
your two Gods, regarding in their separate condition one as distinctively the good God, and
the other as distinctively the just God? Where the just is, there also exists the good. In short,
from the very first the Creator was both good and also just. And both His attributes advanced
together. His goodness created, His justice arranged, the world; and in this process it even
then decreed that the world should be formed of good materials, because it took counsel
with goodness. The work of justice is apparent, in the separation which was pronounced
between light and darkness, between day and night, between heaven and earth, between the
water above and the water beneath, between the gathering together of the sea and the mass
of the dry land, between the greater lights and the lesser, between the luminaries of the day
and those of the night, between male and female, between the tree of knowledge of death
and of life, between the world and paradise, between the aqueous and the earth-born animals.
As goodness conceived all things, so did justice discriminate them. With the determination
of the latter, everything was arranged and set in order. Every site and quality2854 of the elements,
their effect, motion, and state, the rise and setting of each, are the judicial determinations
of the Creator. Do not suppose that His function as a judge must be defined as beginning
when evil began, and so tarnish His justice with the cause of evil. By such considerations,
then, do we show that this attribute advanced in company with goodness, the author2855 of
all things,—worthy of being herself, too, deemed innate and natural, and not as accidentally
accruing2856 to God, inasmuch as she was found to be in Him, her Lord, the arbiter of His
works.</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—Further Description of the Divine Justice; Since the Fall of Man It
Has Regulated the Divine Goodness. God’s Claims on Our Love and Our Fear
Reconciled.</head>
<p>But yet, when evil afterwards broke out, and the goodness of God began now to have
an adversary to contend against, God’s justice also acquired another function, even that of
directing His goodness according to men’s application for it.2857 And this is the result: the
divine goodness, being interrupted in that free course whereby God was spontaneously
good, is now dispensed according to the deserts of every man; it is offered to the worthy,
denied to the unworthy, taken away from the unthankful, and also avenged on all its enemies.
Thus the entire office of justice in this respect becomes an agency2858 for goodness: whatever
it condemns by its judgment, whatever it chastises by its condemnation, whatever (to use
your phrase) it ruthlessly pursues,2859 it, in fact, benefits with good instead of injuring. Indeed,
the fear of judgment contributes to good, not to evil. For good, now contending with
an enemy, was not strong enough to recommend itself2860 by itself alone. At all events, if it
could do so much, it could not keep its ground; for it had lost its impregnability through the
foe, unless some power of fear supervened, such as might compel the very unwilling to seek
after good, and take care of it. But who, when so many incentives to evil were assailing him,
would desire that good, which he could despise with impunity? Who, again, would take care
of what he could lose without danger? You read how broad is the road to evil,2861 how
thronged in comparison with the opposite: would not all glide down that road were there
nothing in it to fear? We dread the Creator’s tremendous threats, and yet scarcely turn away
from evil. What, if He threatened not? Will you call this justice an evil, when it is all unfavourable
to evil? Will you deny it to be a good, when it has its eye towards2862 good? What
sort of being ought you to wish God to be? Would it be right to prefer that He should be
such, that sins might flourish under Him, and the devil make mock at Him? Would you
suppose Him to be a good God, who should be able to make a man worse by security in sin?
Who is the author of good, but He who also requires it? In like manner who is a stranger
to evil, except Him who is its enemy? Who its enemy, besides Him who is its conqueror?
Who else its conqueror, than He who is its punisher? Thus God is wholly good, because in
all things He is on the side of good. In fact, He is omnipotent, because able both to help and

to hurt. Merely to profit is a comparatively small matter, because it can do nothing else than
a good turn. From such a conduct2863 with what confidence can I hope for good, if this is
its only ability? How can I follow after the reward of innocence, if I have no regard to the
requital of wrong-doing? I must needs have my doubts whether he might not fail in recompensing
one or other alternative, who was unequal in his resources to meet both. Thus far,
then, justice is the very fulness of the Deity Himself, manifesting God as both a perfect
father and a perfect master: a father in His mercy, a master in His discipline; a father in the
mildness of His power, a master in its severity; a father who must be loved with dutiful affection,
a master who must needs be feared; be loved, because He prefers mercy to sacrifice;
2864 be feared because He dislikes sin; be loved, because He prefers the sinner’s repentance
to his death;2865 be feared, because He dislikes the sinners who do not repent. Accordingly,
the divine law enjoins duties in respect of both these attributes: Thou shalt love God, and,
Thou shalt fear God. It proposed one for the obedient man, the other for the transgressor.2866</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—Evil of Two Kinds, Penal and Criminal. It is Not of the Latter Sort
that God is the Author, But Only of the Former, Which are Penal, and Included
in His Justice.</head>
<p>On all occasions does God meet you: it is He who smites, but also heals; who kills, but
also makes alive; who humbles, and yet exalts; who “creates2867 evil,” but also “makes
peace;”2868—so that from these very (contrasts of His providence) I may get an answer to
the heretics. Behold, they say, how He acknowledges Himself to be the creator of evil in the
passage, “It is I who create evil.” They take a word whose one form reduces to confusion
and ambiguity two kinds of evils (because both sins and punishments are called evils), and
will have Him in every passage to be understood as the creator of all evil things, in order
that He may be designated the author of evil. We, on the contrary, distinguish between the
two meanings of the word in question, and, by separating evils of sin from penal evils, mala
culpæ from mala poenæ, confine to each of the two classes its own author,—the devil as the
author of the sinful evils (culpæ), and God as the creator of penal evils (poenæ); so that the
one class shall be accounted as morally bad, and the other be classed as the operations of
justice passing penal sentences against the evils of sin. Of the latter class of evils which are
compatible with justice, God is therefore avowedly the creator. They are, no doubt, evil to
those by whom they are endured, but still on their own account good, as being just and defensive
of good and hostile to sin. In this respect they are, moreover, worthy of God. Else
prove them to be unjust, in order to show them deserving of a place in the sinful class, that
is to say, evils of injustice; because if they turn out to belong to justice, they will be no longer
evil things, but good—evil only to the bad, by whom even directly good things are condemned
as evil. In this case, you must decide that man, although the wilful contemner of the divine
law, unjustly bore the doom which he would like to have escaped; that the wickedness of
those days was unjustly smitten by the deluge, afterwards by the fire (of Sodom); that Egypt,
although most depraved and superstitious, and, worse still, the harasser of its guest-population,
2869 was unjustly stricken with the chastisement of its ten plagues. God hardens the
heart of Pharaoh. He deserved, however, to be influenced2870 to his destruction, who had
already denied God, already in his pride so often rejected His ambassadors, accumulated
heavy burdens on His people, and (to sum up all) as an Egyptian, had long been guilty before

<head>Chapter XV.—The Severity of God Compatible with Reason and Justice. When Inflicted,
Not Meant to Be Arbitrary, But Remedial.</head>
<p>Consider well,2873 then, before all things the justice of the Judge; and if its purpose2874
be clear, then the severity thereof, and the operations of the severity in its course, will appear
compatible with reason and justice. Now, that we may not linger too long on the point, (I
would challenge you to) assert the other reasons also, that you may condemn the Judge’s
sentences; extenuate the delinquencies of the sinner, that you may blame his judicial conviction.
Never mind censuring the Judge; rather prove Him to be an unjust one. Well, then,
even though2875 He required the sins of the fathers at the hands of the children, the hardness
of the people made such remedial measures necessary2876 for them, in order that, having
their posterity in view, they might obey the divine law. For who is there that feels not a
greater care for his children than for himself? Again, if the blessing of the fathers was destined
likewise for their offspring, previous to2877 any merit on the part of these, why might not
the guilt of the fathers also redound to their children? As was the grace, so was the offence;
so that the grace and the offence equally ran down through the whole race, with the reservation,
indeed, of that subsequent ordinance by which it became possible to refrain from saying,
that “the fathers had eaten a sour grape, and the children’s teeth were set on edge:”2878 in
other words, that the father should not bear the iniquity of the son, nor the son the iniquity
of the father, but that every man should be chargeable with his own sin; so that the harshness
of the law having been reduced2879 after the hardness of the people, justice was no longer
to judge the race, but individuals. If, however, you accept the gospel of truth, you will discover
on whom recoils the sentence of the Judge, when requiting on sons the sins of their
fathers, even on those who had been (hardened enough) to imprecate spontaneously on
themselves this condemnation: “His blood be on us, and on our children.”2880 This, therefore,
the providence of God has ordered throughout its course,2881 even as it had heard it.</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—To the Severity of God There Belong Accessory Qualities, Compatible
with Justice. If Human Passions are Predicated of God, They Must Not Be
Measured on the Scale of Human Imperfection.</head>
<p>Even His severity then is good, because just: when the judge is good, that is just. Other
qualities likewise are good, by means of which the good work of a good severity runs out
its course, whether wrath, or jealousy,2882 or sternness.2883 For all these are as indispensable2884
to severity as severity is to justice. The shamelessness of an age, which ought to
have been reverent, had to be avenged. Accordingly, qualities which pertain to the judge,
when they are actually free from blame, as the judge himself is, will never be able to be
charged upon him as a fault.2885 What would be said, if, when you thought the doctor necessary,
you were to find fault with his instruments, because they cut, or cauterize, or amputate,
or tighten; whereas there could be no doctor of any value without his professional
tools? Censure, if you please, the practitioner who cuts badly, amputates clumsily, is rash
in his cautery; and even blame his implements as rough tools of his art. Your conduct is
equally unreasonable,2886 when you allow indeed that God is a judge, but at the same time
destroy those operations and dispositions by which He discharges His judicial functions.
We are taught2887 God by the prophets, and by Christ, not by the philosophers nor by Epicurus.
We who believe that God really lived on earth, and took upon Him the low estate of
human form,2888 for the purpose of man’s salvation, are very far from thinking as those do
who refuse to believe that God cares for2889 anything. Whence has found its way to the
heretics an argument of this kind: If God is angry, and jealous, and roused, and grieved,
He must therefore be corrupted, and must therefore die. Fortunately, however, it is a part
of the creed of Christians even to believe that God did die,2890 and yet that He is alive for
evermore. Superlative is their folly, who prejudge divine things from human; so that, because
in man’s corrupt condition there are found passions of this description, therefore there must
be deemed to exist in God also sensations2891 of the same kind. Discriminate between the

natures, and assign to them their respective senses, which are as diverse as their natures require,
although they seem to have a community of designations. We read, indeed, of God’s
right hand, and eyes, and feet: these must not, however, be compared with those of human
beings, because they are associated in one and the same name. Now, as great as shall be the
difference between the divine and the human body, although their members pass under
identical names, so great will also be the diversity between the divine and the human soul,
notwithstanding that their sensations are designated by the same names. These sensations
in the human being are rendered just as corrupt by the corruptibility of man’s substance,
as in God they are rendered incorruptible by the incorruption of the divine essence. Do
you really believe the Creator to be God? By all means, is your reply. How then do you
suppose that in God there is anything human, and not that all is divine? Him whom you
do not deny to be God, you confess to be not human; because, when you confess Him to be
God, you have, in fact, already determined that He is undoubtedly diverse from every sort
of human conditions. Furthermore, although you allow, with others,2892 that man was inbreathed
by God into a living soul, not God by man, it is yet palpably absurd of you to be
placing human characteristics in God rather than divine ones in man, and clothing God in
the likeness of man, instead of man in the image of God. And this, therefore, is to be deemed
the likeness of God in man, that the human soul have the same emotions and sensations as
God, although they are not of the same kind; differing as they do both in their conditions
and their issues according to their nature. Then, again, with respect to the opposite sensations,—
I mean meekness, patience, mercy, and the very parent of them all, goodness,—why
do you form your opinion of2893 the divine displays of these (from the human qualities)?
For we indeed do not possess them in perfection, because it is God alone who is perfect. So
also in regard to those others,—namely, anger and irritation, we are not affected by them
in so happy a manner, because God alone is truly happy, by reason of His property of incorruptibility.
Angry He will possibly be, but not irritated, nor dangerously tempted;2894 He
will be moved, but not subverted.2895 All appliances He must needs use, because of all
contingencies; as many sensations as there are causes: anger because of the wicked, and indignation
because of the ungrateful, and jealousy because of the proud, and whatsoever else
is a hinderance to the evil. So, again, mercy on account of the erring, and patience on account
of the impenitent, and pre-eminent resources2896 on account of the meritorious, and
whatsoever is necessary to the good. All these affections He is moved by in that peculiar

<p>These considerations show that the entire order of God as Judge is an operative one,
and (that I may express myself in worthier words) protective of His Catholic2898 and supreme
goodness, which, removed as it is from judiciary emotions, and pure in its own condition,
the Marcionites refuse to acknowledge to be in one and the same Deity, “raining on the just
and on the unjust, and making His sun to rise on the evil and on the good,”2899—a bounty
which no other god at all exercises. It is true that Marcion has been bold enough to erase
from the gospel this testimony of Christ to the Creator; but yet the world itself is inscribed
with the goodness of its Maker, and the inscription is read by each man’s conscience. Nay,
this very long-suffering of the Creator will tend to the condemnation of Marcion; that patience,
(I mean,) which waits for the sinner’s repentance rather than his death, which prefers
mercy to sacrifice,2900 averting from the Ninevites the ruin which had been already denounced
against them,2901 and vouchsafing to Hezekiah’s tears an extension of his life,2902
and restoring his kingly state to the monarch of Babylon after his complete repentance;2903
that mercy, too, which conceded to the devotion of the people the son of Saul when about
to die,2904 and gave free forgiveness to David on his confessing his sins against the house
of Uriah;2905 which also restored the house of Israel as often as it condemned it, and addressed
to it consolation no less frequently than reproof. Do not therefore look at God
simply as Judge, but turn your attention also to examples of His conduct as the Most
Good.2906 Noting Him, as you do, when He takes vengeance, consider Him likewise when
He shows mercy.2907 In the scale, against His severity place His gentleness. When you shall
have discovered both qualities to co-exist in the Creator, you will find in Him that very circumstance
which induces you to think there is another God. Lastly, come and examine into
His doctrine, discipline, precepts, and counsels. You will perhaps say that there are equally
good prescriptions in human laws. But Moses and God existed before all your Lycurguses

witness; thou shalt not covet what is thy neighbour’s; honour thy father and thy mother;
and, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. To these prime counsels of innocence, chastity,
and justice, and piety, are also added prescriptions of humanity, as when every seventh year
slaves are released for liberty;2909 when at the same period the land is spared from tillage;
a place is also granted to the needy; and from the treading ox’s mouth the muzzle is removed,
for the enjoyment of the fruit of his labour before him, in order that kindness first shown
in the case of animals might be raised from such rudiments2910 to the refreshment2911 of

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Some of God’s Laws Defended as Good, Which the Marcionites
Impeached, Such as the Lex Talionis. Useful Purposes in a Social and Moral
Point of View of This, and Sundry Other Enactments.</head>
<p>But what parts of the law can I defend as good with a greater confidence than those
which heresy has shown such a longing for?—as the statute of retaliation, requiring eye for
eye, tooth for tooth, and stripe for stripe.2912 Now there is not here any smack of a permission
to mutual injury; but rather, on the whole, a provision for restraining violence. To a people
which was very obdurate, and wanting in faith towards God, it might seem tedious, and
even incredible, to expect from God that vengeance which was subsequently to be declared
by the prophet: “Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.”2913 Therefore, in the
meanwhile, the commission of wrong was to be checked2914 by the fear of a retribution
immediately to happen; and so the permission of this retribution was to be the prohibition
of provocation, that a stop might thus be put to all hot-blooded2915 injury, whilst by the
permission of the second the first is prevented by fear, and by this deterring of the first the
second fails to be committed. By the same law another result is also obtained,2916 even the
more ready kindling of the fear of retaliation by reason of the very savour of passion which
is in it. There is no more bitter thing, than to endure the very suffering which you have inflicted
upon others. When, again, the law took somewhat away from men’s food, by pronouncing
unclean certain animals which were once blessed, you should understand this to
be a measure for encouraging continence, and recognise in it a bridle imposed on that appetite
which, while eating angels’ food, craved after the cucumbers and melons of the
Egyptians. Recognise also therein a precaution against those companions of the appetite,
even lust and luxury, which are usually chilled by the chastening of the appetite.2917 For
“the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.”2918 Furthermore, that an
eager wish for money might be restrained, so far as it is caused by the need of food, the desire
for costly meat and drink was taken out of their power. Lastly, in order that man might be
more readily educated by God for fasting, he was accustomed to such articles of food as
were neither plentiful nor sumptuous, and not likely to pamper the appetite of the luxurious.
Of course the Creator deserved all the greater blame, because it was from His own people

that He took away food, rather than from the more ungrateful Marcionites. As for the burdensome
sacrifices also, and the troublesome scrupulousness of their ceremonies2919 and
oblations, no one should blame them, as if God specially required them for Himself: for He
plainly asks, “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?” and, “Who hath
required them at your hand?”2920 But he should see herein a careful provision2921 on God’s
part, which showed His wish to bind to His own religion a people who were prone to idolatry
and transgression by that kind of services wherein consisted the superstition of that period;
that He might call them away therefrom, while requesting it to be performed to Himself, as
if He desired that no sin should be committed in making idols.</p>

Many Beautiful Passages from Them Quoted in Illustration of This Attribute.</head>
<p>But even in the common transactions of life, and of human intercourse at home and in
public, even to the care of the smallest vessels, He in every possible manner made distinct
arrangement; in order that, when they everywhere encountered these legal instructions,
they might not be at any moment out of the sight of God. For what could better tend to
make a man happy, than having “his delight in the law of the Lord?” “In that law would he
meditate day and night.”2922 It was not in severity that its Author promulgated this law, but
in the interest of the highest benevolence, which rather aimed at subduing2923 the nation’s
hardness of heart, and by laborious services hewing out a fealty which was (as yet) untried
in obedience: for I purposely abstain from touching on the mysterious senses of the law,
considered in its spiritual and prophetic relation, and as abounding in types of almost every
variety and sort. It is enough at present, that it simply bound a man to God, so that no one
ought to find fault with it, except him who does not choose to serve God. To help forward
this beneficent, not onerous, purpose of the law, the prophets were also ordained by the
self-same goodness of God, teaching precepts worthy of God, how that men should “cease
to do evil, learn to do well, seek judgment, judge the fatherless,2924 and plead for the widow:”
2925 be fond of the divine expostulations:2926 avoid contact with the wicked:2927 “let
the oppressed go free:”2928 dismiss the unjust sentence,2929 “deal their bread to the hungry;
bring the outcast into their house; cover the naked, when they see him; nor hide themselves
from their own flesh and kin:”2930 “keep their tongue from evil, and their lips from speaking
guile: depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it:”2931 be angry, and sin not;
that is, not persevere in anger, or be enraged:2932 “walk not in the counsel of the ungodly;
nor stand in the way of sinners; nor sit in the seat of the scornful.”2933 Where then? “Behold,

<head>Chapter XX.—The Marcionites Charged God with Having Instigated the Hebrews
to Spoil the Egyptians. Defence of the Divine Dispensation in that Matter.</head>
<p>But these “saucy cuttles”2944 (of heretics) under the figure of whom the law about things
to be eaten2945 prohibited this very kind of piscatory aliment, as soon as they find themselves
confuted, eject the black venom of their blasphemy, and so spread about in all directions
the object which (as is now plain) they severally have in view, when they put forth such assertions
and protestations as shall obscure and tarnish the rekindled light2946 of the Creator’s
bounty. We will, however, follow their wicked design, even through these black clouds, and
drag to light their tricks of dark calumny, laying to the Creator’s charge with especial emphasis
the fraud and theft of gold and silver which the Hebrews were commanded by Him
to practise against the Egyptians. Come, unhappy heretic, I cite even you as a witness; first
look at the case of the two nations, and then you will form a judgment of the Author of the
command. The Egyptians put in a claim on the Hebrews for these gold and silver vessels.2947
The Hebrews assert a counter claim, alleging that by the bond2948 of their respective fathers,
attested by the written engagement of both parties, there were due to them the arrears of
that laborious slavery of theirs, for the bricks they had so painfully made, and the cities and
palaces2949 which they had built. What shall be your verdict, you discoverer2950 of the most
good God? That the Hebrews must admit the fraud, or the Egyptians the compensation?
For they maintain that thus has the question been settled by the advocates on both sides,2951

colours more dark and blackish, yes, and more firme and steady, than the female. If the female be smitted with
the trout-speare, they will come to succour her; but she again is not so kind to them: for if the male be stricken,
she will not stand to it, but runs away. But both of them, if they perceive that they be taken in such streights that
they cannot escape, shed from them a certain black humor like to ink; and when the water therewith is troubled
and made duskish, therein they hide themselves, and are no more seen” (Holland’s Translation, p. 250). Our
epithet “saucy cuttle” comes from Shakespeare, 2 Henry iv 2, 4, where, however, the word seems employed in a
different sense.</note>

of the Egyptians demanding their vessels, and the Hebrews claiming the requital of their
labours. But for all they say,2952 the Egyptians justly renounced their restitution-claim then
and there; while the Hebrews to this day, in spite of the Marcionites, re-assert their demand
for even greater damages,2953 insisting that, however large was their loan of the gold and
silver, it would not be compensation enough, even if the labour of six hundred thousand
men should be valued at only “a farthing”2954 a day a piece. Which, however, were the more
in number—those who claimed the vessel, or those who dwelt in the palaces and cities?
Which, too, the greater—the grievance of the Egyptians against the Hebrews, or “the favour”
2955 which they displayed towards them? Were free men reduced to servile labour, in
order that the Hebrews might simply proceed against the Egyptians by action at law for injuries;
or in order that their officers might on their benches sit and exhibit their backs and
shoulders shamefully mangled by the fierce application of the scourge? It was not by a few
plates and cup—in all cases the property, no doubt, of still fewer rich men—that any one
would pronounce that compensation should have been awarded to the Hebrews, but both
by all the resources of these and by the contributions of all the people.2956 If, therefore, the
case of the Hebrews be a good one, the Creator’s case must likewise be a good one; that is
to say, his command, when He both made the Egyptians unconsciously grateful, and also
gave His own people their discharge in full2957 at the time of their migration by the scanty
comfort of a tacit requital of their long servitude. It was plainly less than their due which He
commanded to be exacted. The Egyptians ought to have given back their men-children2958

<head>Chapter XXI.—The Law of the Sabbath-Day Explained. The Eight Days’ Procession
Around Jericho. The Gathering of Sticks a Violation.</head>
<p>Similarly on other points also, you reproach Him with fickleness and instability for
contradictions in His commandments, such as that He forbade work to be done on Sabbathdays,
and yet at the siege of Jericho ordered the ark to be carried round the walls during
eight days; in other words, of course, actually on a Sabbath. You do not, however, consider
the law of the Sabbath: they are human works, not divine, which it prohibits.2959 For it says,
“Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the
Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work.” What work? Of course your own. The
conclusion is, that from the Sabbath-day He removes those works which He had before
enjoined for the six days, that is, your own works; in other words, human works of daily
life. Now, the carrying around of the ark is evidently not an ordinary daily duty, nor yet a
human one; but a rare and a sacred work, and, as being then ordered by the direct precept
of God, a divine one. And I might fully explain what this signified, were it not a tedious
process to open out the forms2960 of all the Creator’s proofs, which you would, moreover,
probably refuse to allow. It is more to the point, if you be confuted on plain matters2961 by
the simplicity of truth rather than curious reasoning. Thus, in the present instance, there is
a clear distinction respecting the Sabbath’s prohibition of human labours, not divine ones.
Accordingly, the man who went and gathered sticks on the Sabbath-day was punished with
death. For it was his own work which he did; and this2962 the law forbade. They, however,
who on the Sabbath carried the ark round Jericho, did it with impunity. For it was not their
own work, but God’s, which they executed, and that too, from His express commandment.</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—The Brazen Serpent and the Golden Cherubim Were Not Violations
of the Second Commandment. Their Meaning.</head>
<p>Likewise, when forbidding the similitude to be made of all things which are in heaven,
and in earth, and in the waters, He declared also the reasons, as being prohibitory of all
material exhibition2963 of a latent2964 idolatry. For He adds: “Thou shalt not bow down to
them, nor serve them.” The form, however, of the brazen serpent which the Lord afterwards
commanded Moses to make, afforded no pretext2965 for idolatry, but was meant for the
cure of those who were plagued with the fiery serpents.2966 I say nothing of what was figured
by this cure.2967 Thus, too, the golden Cherubim and Seraphim were purely an ornament
in the figured fashion2968 of the ark; adapted to ornamentation for reasons totally remote
from all condition of idolatry, on account of which the making a likeness is prohibited; and
they are evidently not at variance with2969 this law of prohibition, because they are not
found in that form2970 of similitude, in reference to which the prohibition is given. We have
spoken2971 of the rational institution of the sacrifices, as calling off their homage from idols
to God; and if He afterwards rejected this homage, saying, “To what purpose is the multitude
of your sacrifices unto me?”2972—He meant nothing else than this to be understood, that
He had never really required such homage for Himself. For He says, “I will not eat the flesh
of bulls;”2973 and in another passage: “The everlasting God shall neither hunger nor
thirst.”2974 Although He had respect to the offerings of Abel, and smelled a sweet savour
from the holocaust of Noah, yet what pleasure could He receive from the flesh of sheep, or
the odour of burning victims? And yet the simple and God-fearing mind of those who
offered what they were receiving from God, both in the way of food and of a sweet smell,
was favourably accepted before God, in the sense of respectful homage2975 to God, who did

that some dependant were to offer to a rich man or a king, who was in want of nothing,
some very insignificant gift, will the amount and quality of the gift bring dishonour2976 to
the rich man and the king; or will the consideration2977 of the homage give them pleasure?
Were, however, the dependant, either of his own accord or even in compliance with a
command, to present to him gifts suitably to his rank, and were he to observe the solemnities
due to a king, only without faith and purity of heart, and without any readiness for other
acts of obedience, will not that king or rich man consequently exclaim: “To what purpose
is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? I am full of your solemnities, your feast-days,
and your Sabbaths.”2978 By calling them yours, as having been performed2979 after the giver’s
own will, and not according to the religion of God (since he displayed them as his own, and
not as God’s), the Almighty in this passage, demonstrated how suitable to the conditions of

<head>Chapter XXIII.—God’s Purposes in Election and Rejection of the Same Men, Such
as King Saul, Explained, in Answer to the Marcionite Cavil.</head>
<p>Now, although you will have it that He is inconstant2980 in respect of persons, sometimes
disapproving where approbation is deserved; or else wanting in foresight, bestowing approbation
on men who ought rather to be reprobated, as if He either censured2981 His own past
judgments, or could not forecast His future ones; yet2982 nothing is so consistent for even
a good judge2983 as both to reject and to choose on the merits of the present moment. Saul
is chosen,2984 but he is not yet the despiser of the prophet Samuel.2985 Solomon is rejected;
but he is now become a prey to foreign women, and a slave to the idols of Moab and Sidon.
What must the Creator do, in order to escape the censure of the Marcionites? Must He
prematurely condemn men, who are thus far correct in their conduct, because of future
delinquencies? But it is not the mark of a good God to condemn beforehand persons who
have not yet deserved condemnation. Must He then refuse to eject sinners, on account of
their previous good deeds? But it is not the characteristic of a just judge to forgive sins in
consideration of former virtues which are no longer practised. Now, who is so faultless
among men, that God could always have him in His choice, and never be able to reject him?
Or who, on the other hand, is so void of any good work, that God could reject him for ever,
and never be able to choose him? Show me, then, the man who is always good, and he will
not be rejected; show me, too, him who is always evil, and he will never be chosen. Should,
however, the same man, being found on different occasions in the pursuit of both (good
and evil) be recompensed2986 in both directions by God, who is both a good and judicial
Being, He does not change His judgments through inconstancy or want of foresight, but
dispenses reward according to the deserts of each case with a most unwavering and

<head>Chapter XXIV.—Instances of God’s Repentance, and Notably in the Case of the
Ninevites, Accounted for and Vindicated.</head>
<p>Furthermore, with respect to the repentance which occurs in His conduct,2988 you interpret
it with similar perverseness just as if it were with fickleness and improvidence that
He repented, or on the recollection of some wrong-doing; because He actually said, “It repenteth
me that I have set up Saul to be king,”2989 very much as if He meant that His repentance
savoured of an acknowledgment of some evil work or error. Well,2990 this is not always
implied. For there occurs even in good works a confession of repentance, as a reproach and
condemnation of the man who has proved himself unthankful for a benefit. For instance,
in this case of Saul, the Creator, who had made no mistake in selecting him for the kingdom,
and endowing him with His Holy Spirit, makes a statement respecting the goodliness of his
person, how that He had most fitly chosen him as being at that moment the choicest man,
so that (as He says) there was not his fellow among the children of Israel.2991 Neither was
He ignorant how he would afterwards turn out. For no one would bear you out in imputing
lack of foresight to that God whom, since you do not deny Him to be divine, you allow to
be also foreseeing; for this proper attribute of divinity exists in Him. However, He did, as
I have said, burden2992 the guilt of Saul with the confession of His own repentance; but as
there is an absence of all error and wrong in His choice of Saul, it follows that this repentance
is to be understood as upbraiding another2993 rather than as self-incriminating.2994 Look
here then, say you: I discover a self-incriminating case in the matter of the Ninevites, when
the book of Jonah declares, “And God repented of the evil that He had said that He would
do unto them; and He did it not.”2995 In accordance with which Jonah himself says unto
the Lord, “Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish; for I knew that Thou art a gracious God

well, therefore, that he premised the attribute2997 of the most good God as most patient
over the wicked, and most abundant in mercy and kindness over such as acknowledged and

bewailed their sins, as the Ninevites were then doing. For if He who has this attribute is the
Most Good, you will have first to relinquish that position of yours, that the very contact
with2998 evil is incompatible with such a Being, that is, with the most good God. And because
Marcion, too, maintains that a good tree ought not to produce bad fruit; but yet he has
mentioned “evil” (in the passage under discussion), which the most good God is incapable
of,2999 is there forthcoming any explanation of these “evils,” which may render them compatible
with even the most Good? There is. We say, in short, that evil in the present case3000
means, not what may be attributed to the Creator’s nature as an evil being, but what may
be attributed to His power as a judge. In accordance with which He declared, “I create
evil,”3001 and, “I frame evil against you;”3002 meaning not to sinful evils, but avenging ones.
What sort of stigma3003 pertains to these, congruous as they are with God’s judicial character,
we have sufficiently explained.3004 Now although these are called “evils,” they are yet not
reprehensible in a judge; nor because of this their name do they show that the judge is evil:
so in like manner will this particular evil3005 be understood to be one of this class of judiciary
evils, and along with them to be compatible with (God as) a judge. The Greeks also sometimes3006
use the word “evils” for troubles and injuries (not malignant ones), as in this
passage of yours3007 is also meant. Therefore, if the Creator repented of such evil as this, as
showing that the creature deserve decondemnation, and ought to be punished for his sin,
then, in3008 the present instance no fault of a criminating nature will be imputed to the
Creator, for having deservedly and worthily decreed the destruction of a city so full of
iniquity. What therefore He had justly decreed, having no evil purpose in His decree, He
decreed from the principle of justice,3009 not from malevolence. Yet He gave it the name of
“evil,” because of the evil and desert involved in the very suffering itself. Then, you will say,
if you excuse the evil under name of justice, on the ground that He had justly determined

destruction against the people of Nineveh, He must even on this argument be blameworthy,
for having repented of an act of justice, which surely should not be repented of. Certainly
not,3010 my reply is; God will never repent of an act of justice. And it now remains that we
should understand what God’s repentance means. For although man repents most frequently
on the recollection of a sin, and occasionally even from the unpleasantness3011 of some
good action, this is never the case with God. For, inasmuch as God neither commits sin nor
condemns a good action, in so far is there no room in Him for repentance of either a good
or an evil deed. Now this point is determined for you even in the scripture which we have
quoted. Samuel says to Saul, “The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day,
and hath given it to a neighbour of thine that is better than thou;”3012 and into two parts
shall Israel be divided: “for He will not turn Himself, nor repent; for He does not repent as
a man does.”3013 According, therefore, to this definition, the divine repentance takes in all
cases a different form from that of man, in that it is never regarded as the result of improvidence
or of fickleness, or of any condemnation of a good or an evil work. What, then, will
be the mode of God’s repentance? It is already quite clear,3014 if you avoid referring it to
human conditions. For it will have no other meaning than a simple change of a prior purpose;
and this is admissible without any blame even in a man, much more3015 in God, whose
every purpose is faultless. Now in Greek the word for repentance (μετάνοια) is formed, not
from the confession of a sin, but from a change of mind, which in God we have shown to
be regulated by the occurrence of varying circumstances.</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—God’s Dealings with Adam at the Fall, and with Cain After His
Crime, Admirably Explained and Defended.</head>
<p>It is now high time that I should, in order to meet all3016 objections of this kind, proceed
to the explanation and clearing up3017 of the other trifles,3018 weak points, and inconsistencies,
as you deemed them. God calls out to Adam,3019 Where art thou? as if ignorant where
he was; and when he alleged that the shame of his nakedness was the cause (of his hiding
himself), He inquired whether he had eaten of the tree, as if He were in doubt. By no
means;3020 God was neither uncertain about the commission of the sin, nor ignorant of
Adam’s whereabouts. It was certainly proper to summon the offender, who was concealing
himself from the consciousness of his sin, and to bring him forth into the presence of his
Lord, not merely by the calling out of his name, but with a home-thrust blow3021 at the sin
which he had at that moment committed. For the question ought not to be read in a merely
interrogative tone, Where art thou, Adam? but with an impressive and earnest voice, and
with an air of imputation, Oh, Adam, where art thou?—as much as to intimate: thou art no
longer here, thou art in perdition—so that the voice is the utterance of One who is at once
rebuking and sorrowing.3022 But of course some part of paradise had escaped the eye of
Him who holds the universe in His hand as if it were a bird’s nest, and to whom heaven is
a throne and earth a footstool; so that He could not see, before He summoned him forth,
where Adam was, both while lurking and when eating of the forbidden fruit! The wolf or
the paltry thief escapes not the notice of the keeper of your vineyard or your garden! And
God, I suppose, with His keener vision,3023 from on high was unable to miss the sight of3024
aught which lay beneath Him! Foolish heretic, who treat with scorn3025 so fine an argument
of God’s greatness and man’s instruction! God put the question with an appearance of uncertainty,
in order that even here He might prove man to be the subject of a free will in the
alternative of either a denial or a confession, and give to him the opportunity of freely ac-

knowledging his transgression, and, so far,3026 of lightening it.3027 In like manner He inquires
of Cain where his brother was, just as if He had not yet heard the blood of Abel crying from
the ground, in order that he too might have the opportunity from the same power of the
will of spontaneously denying, and to this degree aggravating, his crime; and that thus there
might be supplied to us examples of confessing sins rather than of denying them: so that
even then was initiated the evangelic doctrine, “By thy words3028 thou shalt be justified,
and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.”3029 Now, although Adam was by reason of
his condition under law3030 subject to death, yet was hope preserved to him by the Lord’s
saying, “Behold, Adam is become as one of us;”3031 that is, in consequence of the future
taking of the man into the divine nature. Then what follows? “And now, lest he put forth
his hand, and take also of the tree of life, (and eat), and live for ever.” Inserting thus the
particle of present time, “And now,” He shows that He had made for a time, and at present,
a prolongation of man’s life. Therefore He did not actually3032 curse Adam and Eve, for
they were candidates for restoration, and they had been relieved3033 by confession. Cain,
however, He not only cursed; but when he wished to atone for his sin by death, He even
prohibited his dying, so that he had to bear the load of this prohibition in addition to his
crime. This, then, will prove to be the ignorance of our God, which was simulated on this
account, that delinquent man should not be unaware of what he ought to do. Coming down
to the case of Sodom and Gomorrha, he says: “I will go down now, and see whether they
have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me; and if not, I will
know.”3034 Well, was He in this instance also uncertain through ignorance, and desiring to
know? Or was this a necessary tone of utterance, as expressive of a minatory and not a dubious
sense, under the colour of an inquiry? If you make merry at God’s “going down,” as
if He could not except by the descent have accomplished His judgment, take care that you
do not strike your own God with as hard a blow. For He also came down to accomplish
what He wished.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—The Oath of God: Its Meaning. Moses, When Deprecating God’s
Wrath Against Israel, a Type of Christ.</head>
<p>But God also swears. Well, is it, I wonder, by the God of Marcion? No, no, he says; a
much vainer oath—by Himself!3035 What was He to do, when He knew3036 of no other
God; especially when He was swearing to this very point, that besides himself there was absolutely
no God? Is it then of swearing falsely that you convict3037 Him, or of swearing a
vain oath? But it is not possible for him to appear to have sworn falsely, when he was ignorant,
as you say he was, that there was another God. For when he swore by that which he knew,
he really committed no perjury. But it was not a vain oath for him to swear that there was
no other God. It would indeed be a vain oath, if there had been no persons who believed
that there were other Gods, like the worshippers of idols then, and the heretics of the present
day. Therefore He swears by Himself, in order that you may believe God, even when He
swears that there is besides Himself no other God at all. But you have yourself, O Marcion,
compelled God to do this. For even so early as then were you foreseen. Hence, if He swears
both in His promises and His threatenings, and thus extorts3038 faith which at first was
difficult, nothing is unworthy of God which causes men to believe in God. But (you say)
God was even then mean3039 enough in His very fierceness, when, in His wrath against the
people for their consecration of the calf, He makes this request of His servant Moses: “Let
me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I
will make of thee a great nation.”3040 Accordingly, you maintain that Moses is better than
his God, as the deprecator, nay the averter, of His anger. “For,” said he, “Thou shalt not do
this; or else destroy me along with them.”3041 Pitiable are ye also, as well as the people, since
you know not Christ, prefigured in the person of Moses as the deprecator of the Father, and
the offerer of His own life for the salvation of the people. It is enough, however, that the
nation was at the instant really given to Moses. That which he, as a servant, was able to ask
of the Lord, the Lord required of Himself. For this purpose did He say to His servant, “Let
me alone, that I may consume them,” in order that by his entreaty, and by offering himself,

<head>Chapter XXVII.—Other Objections Considered. God’s Condescension in the Incarnation.
Nothing Derogatory to the Divine Being in This Economy. The Divine
Majesty Worthily Sustained by the Almighty Father, Never Visible to Man.
Perverseness of the Marcionite Cavils.</head>
<p>And now, that I may briefly pass in review3044 the other points which you have thus far
been engaged in collecting, as mean, weak, and unworthy, for demolishing3045 the Creator,
I will propound them in a simple and definite statement:3046 that God would have been
unable to hold any intercourse with men, if He had not taken on Himself the emotions and
affections of man, by means of which He could temper the strength of His majesty, which
would no doubt have been incapable of endurance to the moderate capacity of man, by such
a humiliation as was indeed degrading3047 to Himself, but necessary for man, and such as
on this very account became worthy of God, because nothing is so worthy of God as the
salvation of man. If I were arguing with heathens, I should dwell more at length on this
point; although with heretics too the discussion does not stand on very different grounds.
Inasmuch as ye yourselves have now come to the belief that God moved about3048 in the
form and all other circumstances of man’s nature,3049 you will of course no longer require
to be convinced that God conformed Himself to humanity, but feel yourselves bound by
your own faith. For if the God (in whom ye believe,) even from His higher condition, prostrated
the supreme dignity of His majesty to such a lowliness as to undergo death, even the
death of the cross, why can you not suppose that some humiliations3050 are becoming to
our God also, only more tolerable than Jewish contumelies, and crosses,3051 and sepulchres?
Are these the humiliations which henceforth are to raise a prejudice against Christ (the
subject as He is of human passions3052) being a partaker of that Godhead3053 against which
you make the participation in human qualities a reproach? Now we believe that Christ did
ever act in the name of God the Father; that He actually3054 from the beginning held inter-

course with (men); actually3055 communed with3056 patriarchs and prophets; was the Son
of the Creator; was His Word; whom God made His Son3057 by emitting Him from His
own self,3058 and thenceforth set Him over every dispensation and (administration of) His
will,3059 making Him a little lower than the angels, as is written in David.3060 In which
lowering of His condition He received from the Father a dispensation in those very respects
which you blame as human; from the very beginning learning,3061 even then, (that state of
a) man which He was destined in the end to become.3062 It is He who descends, He who
interrogates, He who demands, He who swears. With regard, however, to the Father, the
very gospel which is common to us will testify that He was never visible, according to the
word of Christ: “No man knoweth the Father, save the Son.”3063 For even in the Old Testament
He had declared, “No man shall see me, and live.”3064 He means that the Father is

i. p. 18: “The Son hath executed judgment from the beginning, throwing down the haughty tower, and dividing
the tongues, punishing the whole world by the violence of waters, raining upon Sodom and Gomorrha fire and
brimstone ‘the Lord from the Lord.’ For he it was who at all times came down to hold converse with men, from
Adam on to the patriarchs and the prophets, in vision, in dream, in mirror, in dark saying; ever from the beginning
laying the foundation of the course (of His dispensations), which He meant to follow out unto the end. Thus
was He ever learning (practising or rehearsing); and the God who conversed with men upon earth could be no
other than the Word, which was to be made flesh. But He was thus learning (or rehearsing, ediscebat) in order
to level for us the way of faith, that we might the more readily believe that the Son of God had come down into
the world, if we knew that in times past also something similar had been done.” The original thus opens: “Filius
itaque est qui ab initio judicavit.” This the author connects with John iii. 35, Matt. xxviii. 18, John v. 22. The
“judgment” is dispensational from the first to the last. Every judicial function of God’s providence from Eden
to the judgment day is administered by the Son of God. This office of judge has been largely dealt with in its
general view by Tertullian, in this book ii. against Marcion (see chap. xi.–xvii.).</note>

invisible, in whose authority and in whose name was He God who appeared as the Son of
God. But with us3065 Christ is received in the person of Christ, because even in this manner
is He our God. Whatever attributes therefore you require as worthy of God, must be found
in the Father, who is invisible and unapproachable, and placid, and (so to speak) the God
of the philosophers; whereas those qualities which you censure as unworthy must be supposed
to be in the Son, who has been seen, and heard, and encountered, the Witness and Servant
of the Father, uniting in Himself man and God, God in mighty deeds, in weak ones man,
in order that He may give to man as much as He takes from God. What in your esteem is
the entire disgrace of my God, is in fact the sacrament of man’s salvation. God held converse
with man, that man might learn to act as God. God dealt on equal terms3066 with man, that
man might be able to deal on equal terms with God. God was found little, that man might
become very great. You who disdain such a God, I hardly know whether you ex fidebelieve
that God was crucified. How great, then, is your perversity in respect of the two characters
of the Creator! You designate Him as Judge, and reprobate as cruelty that severity of the
Judge which only acts in accord with the merits of cases. You require God to be very good,
and yet despise as meanness that gentleness of His which accorded with His kindness, (and)
held lowly converse in proportion to the mediocrity of man’s estate. He pleases you not,
whether great or little, neither as your judge nor as your friend! What if the same features
should be discovered in your God? That He too is a judge, we have already shown in the
proper section:3067 that from being a judge He must needs be severe; and from being severe
He must also be cruel, if indeed cruel.3068</p>

the True God.</head>
<p>Now, touching the weaknesses and malignities, and the other (alleged), notes (of the
Creator), I too shall advance antitheses in rivalry to Marcion’s. If my God knew not of any
other superior to Himself, your god also was utterly unaware that there was any beneath
himself. It is just what Heraclitus “the obscure”3069 said; whether it be up or down,3070 it
comes to the same thing. If, indeed, he was not ignorant (of his position), it must have occurred
to Him from the beginning. Sin and death, and the author of sin too—the devil—and
all the evil which my God permitted to be, this also, did your god permit; for he allowed
Him to permit it. Our God changed His purposes;3071 in like manner yours did also. For
he who cast his look so late in the human race, changed that purpose, which for so long a
period had refused to cast that look. Our God repented Him of the evil in a given case; so
also did yours. For by the fact that he at last had regard to the salvation of man, he showed
such a repentance of his previous disregard3072 as was due for a wrong deed. But neglect of
man’s salvation will be accounted a wrong deed, simply because it has been remedied3073
by his repentance in the conduct of your god. Our God you say commanded a fraudulent
act, but in a matter of gold and silver. Now, inasmuch as man is more precious than gold
and silver, in so far is your god more fraudulent still, because he robs man of his Lord and
Creator. Eye for eye does our God require; but your god does even a greater injury, (in your
ideas,) when he prevents an act of retaliation. For what man will not return a blow, without
waiting to be struck a second time.3074 Our God (you say) knows not whom He ought to
choose. Nor does your god, for if he had foreknown the issue, he would not have chosen
the traitor Judas. If you allege that the Creator practised deception3075 in any instance, there
was a far greater mendacity in your Christ, whose very body was unreal.3076 Many were
consumed by the severity of my God. Those also who were not saved by your god are verily

disposed by him to ruin. My God ordered a man to be slain. Your god willed himself to be
put to death; not less a homicide against himself than in respect of him by whom he meant
to be slain. I will moreover prove to Marcion that they were many who were slain by his
god; for he made every one a homicide: in other words, he doomed him to perish, except
when people failed in no duty towards Christ.3077 But the straightforward virtue of truth is
contented with few resources.3078 Many things will be necessary for falsehood.</p>

out of the qualities of the (Creator’s) artifices,3080 or of His laws, or of His great
works; and thus sundering Christ from the Creator, as the most Good from the Judge, as
One who is merciful from Him who is ruthless, and One who brings salvation from Him
who causes ruin. The truth is,3081 they3082 rather unite the two Beings whom they arrange
in those diversities (of attribute), which yet are compatible in God. For only take away the
title of Marcion’s book,3083 and the intention and purpose of the work itself, and you could
get no better demonstration that the self-same God was both very good and a Judge, inasmuch
as these two characters are only competently found in God. Indeed, the very effort which
is made in the selected examples to oppose Christ to the Creator, conduces all the more to
their union. For so entirely one and the same was the nature of the Divine Beings, the good
and the severe, as shown both by the same examples and in similar proofs, that It willed to
display Its goodness to those on whom It had first inflicted Its severity. The difference in
time was no matter of surprise, when the same God was afterwards merciful in presence of
evils which had been subdued,3084 who had once been so austere whilst they were as yet
unsubdued. Thus, by help of the Antitheses, the dispensation of the Creator can be more
readily shown to have been reformed by Christ, rather than destroyed;3085 restored, rather
than abolished;3086 especially as you sever your own god from everything like acrimonious
conduct,3087 even from all rivalry whatsoever with the Creator. Now, since this is the case,

how comes it to pass that the Antitheses demonstrate Him to have been the Creator’s rival

has been a jealous God, who has in His own right taken especial care that all things done
by Him should be in their beginning of a robuster growth;3089 and this in the way of a good,
because rational3090 emulation, which tends to maturity. In this sense the world itself will
acknowledge His “antitheses,” from the contrariety of its own elements, although it has been
regulated with the very highest reason.3091 Wherefore, most thoughtless Marcion, it was
your duty to have shown that one (of the two Gods you teach) was a God of light, and the
other a God of darkness; and then you would have found it an easier task to persuade us
that one was a God of goodness, the other a God of severity. How ever, the “antithesis” (or
variety of administration) will rightly be His property, to whom it actually belongs in (the
government of) the world.</p>

<head>Chapter I.—Introductory; A Brief Statement of the Preceding Argument in Connection

<p>Following the track of my original treatise, the loss of which we are steadily proceeding3092
to restore, we come now, in the order of our subject, to treat of Christ, although this
be a work of supererogation,3093 after the proof which we have gone through that there is
but one only God. For no doubt it has been already ruled with sufficient clearness, that
Christ must be regarded as pertaining to3094 no other God than the Creator, when it has
been determined that no other God but the Creator should be the object of our faith. Him
did Christ so expressly preach, whilst the apostles one after the other also so clearly affirmed
that Christ belonged to3095 no other God than Him whom He Himself preached—that is,
the Creator—that no mention of a second God (nor, accordingly, of a second Christ) was
ever agitated previous to Marcion’s scandal. This is most easily proved by an examination3096
of both the apostolic and the heretical churches,3097 from which we are forced to declare
that there is undoubtedly a subversion of the rule (of faith), where any opinion is found of
later date,3098—a point which I have inserted in my first book.3099 A discussion of it would

<head>Chapter II.—Why Christ’s Coming Should Be Previously Announced.</head>
<p>Coming then at once to the point,3103 I have to encounter the question, Whether Christ
ought to have come so suddenly?3104 (I answer, No.) First, because He was the Son of God
His Father. For this was a point of order, that the Father should announce3105 the Son before
the Son should the Father, and that the Father should testify of the Son before the Son should
testify of the Father. Secondly, because, in addition to the title of Son, He was the Sent. The
authority,3106 therefore, of the Sender must needs have first appeared in a testimony of the
Sent; because none who comes in the authority of another does himself set it forth3107 for
himself on his own assertion, but rather looks out for protection from it, for first comes the
support3108 of him who gives him his authority. Now (Christ) will neither be acknowledged
as Son if the Father never named Him, nor be believed in as the Sent One if no Sender3109
gave Him a commission: the Father, if any, purposely naming Him; and the Sender, if any,
purposely commissioning Him. Everything will be open to suspicion which transgresses a
rule. Now the primary order of all things will not allow that the Father should come after
the Son in recognition, or the Sender after the Sent, or God after Christ. Nothing can take
precedence of its own original in being acknowledged, nor in like manner can it in its ordering.
3110 Suddenly a Son, suddenly Sent, and suddenly Christ! On the contrary, I should
suppose that from God nothing comes suddenly, because there is nothing which is not
ordered and arranged by God. And if ordered, why not also foretold, that it may be proved
to have been ordered by the prediction, and by the ordering to be divine? And indeed so
great a work, which (we may be sure) required preparation,3111 as being for the salvation
of man, could not have been on that very account a sudden thing, because it was through
faith that it was to be of avail.3112 Inasmuch, then, as it had to be believed in order to be of
use, so far did it require, for the securing of this faith, a preparation built upon the foundations
of pro-arrangement and fore-announcement. Faith, when informed by such a process,
might justly be required3113 of man by God, and by man be reposed in God; it being a duty,

<head>Chapter III.—Miracles Alone, Without Prophecy, an Insufficient Evidence of Christ’s
Mission.</head>
<p>A procedure3116 of this kind, you say, was not necessary, because He was forthwith to
prove Himself the Son and the Sent One, and the Christ of God in very deed, by means of
the evidence of His wonderful works.3117 On my side, however, I have to deny that evidence
simply of this sort was sufficient as a testimony to Him. He Himself afterwards deprived it
of its authority,3118 because when He declared that many would come and “show great signs
and wonders,”3119 so as to turn aside the very elect, and yet for all that were not to be received,
He showed how rash was belief in signs and wonders, which were so very easy of accomplishment
by even false christs. Else how happens it, if He meant Himself to be approved
and understood, and received on a certain evidence—I mean that of miracles—that He
forbade the recognition of those others who had the very same sort of proof to show, and
whose coming was to be quite as sudden and unannounced by any authority?3120 If, because
He came before them, and was beforehand with them in displaying the signs of His mighty
deeds, He therefore seized the first right to men’s faith,—just as the firstcomers do the first
place in the baths,—and so forestalled all who came after Him in that right, take care that
He, too, be not caught in the condition of the later comers, if He be found to be behindhand
with the Creator, who had already been made known, and had already worked miracles like
Him,3121 and like Him had forewarned men not to believe in others, even such as should
come after Him. If, therefore, to have been the first to come and utter this warning, is to bar
and limit faith,3122 He will Himself have to be condemned, because He was later in being
acknowledged; and authority to prescribe such a rule about later comers will belong to the
Creator alone, who could have been posterior to none. And now, when I am about to prove
that the Creator sometimes displayed by His servants of old, and in other cases reserved for
His Christ to display, the self-same miracles which you claim as solely due to faith in your
Christ, I may fairly even from this maintain that there was so much the greater reason
wherefore Christ should not be believed in simply on account of His miracles, inasmuch as
these would have shown Him to belong to none other (God) than the Creator, because answering
to the mighty deeds of the Creator, both as performed by His servants and reserved

for3123 His Christ; although, even if some other proofs should be found in your Christ—new
ones, to wit—we should more readily believe that they, too, belong to the same God as do
the old ones, rather than to him who has no other than new3124 proofs, such as are wanting
in the evidences of that antiquity which wins the assent of faith,3125 so that even on this
ground he ought to have come announced as much by prophecies of his own building up
faith in him, as by miracles, especially in opposition to the Creator’s Christ who was to come
fortified by signs and prophets of His own, in order that he might shine forth as the rival of
Christ by help of evidence of different kinds. But how was his Christ to be foretold by a god
who was himself never predicted? This, therefore, is the unavoidable inference, that neither
your god nor your Christ is an object of faith, because God ought not to have been unknown,
and Christ ought to have been made known through God.3126</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Marcion’s Christ Not the Subject of Prophecy. The Absurd Consequences
of This Theory of the Heretic.</head>
<p>He3127 disdained, I suppose, to imitate the order of our God, as one who was displeasing
to him, and was by all means to be vanquished. He wished to come, as a new being in a new
way—a son previous to his father’s announcement, a sent one before the authority of the
sender; so that he might in person3128 propagate a most monstrous faith, whereby it should
come to be believed that Christ was come before it should be known that He had an existence.
It is here convenient to me to treat that other point: Why he came not after Christ? For
when I observe that, during so long a period, his lord3129 bore with the greatest patience
the very ruthless Creator who was all the while announcing His Christ to men, I say, that
whatever reason impelled him to do so, postponing thereby his own revelation and interposition,
the self-same reason imposed on him the duty of bearing with the Creator (who had
also in His Christ dispensations of His own to carry out); so that, after the completion and
accomplishment of the entire plan of the rival God and the rival Christ,3130 he might then
superinduce his own proper dispensation. But he grew weary of so long an endurance, and
so failed to wait till the end of the Creator’s course. It was of no use, his enduring that his
Christ should be predicted, when he refused to permit him to be manifested.3131 Either it
was without just cause that he interrupted the full course of his rival’s time, or without just
cause did he so long refrain from interrupting it. What held him back at first? Or what
disturbed him at last? As the case now stands, however,3132 he has committed himself in
respect of both, having revealed himself so tardily after the Creator, so hurriedly before His
Christ; whereas he ought long ago to have encountered the one with a confutation, the
other to have forborne encountering as yet—not to have borne with the one so long in His
ruthless hostility, nor to have disquieted the other, who was as yet quiescent! In the case of
both, while depriving them of their title to be considered the most good God, he showed
himself at least capricious and uncertain; lukewarm (in his resentment) towards the Creator,

that the Christ of the New Testament is the subject of the Old Testament prophecies at all. Hence T.’s anxiety
to adduce prophecy as the main evidence of our Lord as being really the Creator’s Christ.</note>

but fervid against His Christ, and powerless3133 in respect of them both! For he no more
restrained the Creator than he resisted His Christ. The Creator still remains such as He
really is. His Christ also will come,3134 just as it is written of Him. Why did he3135 come
after the Creator, since he was unable to correct Him by punishment?3136 Why did he reveal
himself before Christ, whom he could not hinder from appearing?3137 If, on the contrary,3138
he did chastise the Creator, he revealed himself, (I suppose,) after Him in order that things
which require correction might come first. On which account also, (of course,) he ought to
have waited for Christ to appear first, whom he was going to chastise in like manner; then
he would be His punisher coming after Him,3139 just as he had been in the case of the Creator.
There is another consideration: since he will at his second advent come after Him,
that as he at His first coming took hostile proceedings against the Creator, destroying the
law and the prophets, which were His, so he may, to be sure,3140 at his second coming proceed
in opposition to Christ, upsetting3141 His kingdom. Then, no doubt, he would terminate
his course, and then (if ever)3142 be worthy of belief; for else, if his work has been already
perfected, it would be in vain for him to come, for there would indeed be nothing that he
could further accomplish.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Sundry Features of the Prophetic Style: Principles of Its Interpretation.</head>
<p>These preliminary remarks I have ventured to make3143 at this first step of the discussion
and while the conflict is, as it were, from a distance. But inasmuch as I shall now from this
point have to grapple with my opponent on a distinct issue and in close combat, I perceive
that I must advance even here some lines, at which the battle will have to be delivered; they
are the Scriptures of the Creator. For as I shall have to prove that Christ was from the Creator,
according to these (Scriptures), which were afterwards accomplished in the Creator’s
Christ, I find it necessary to set forth the form and, so to speak, the nature of the Scriptures
themselves, that they may not distract the reader’s attention by being called into controversy
at the moment of their application to subjects of discussion, and by their proof being confounded
with the proof of the subjects themselves. Now there are two conditions of prophetic
announcement which I adduce, as requiring the assent of our adversaries in the future
stages of the discussion. One, that future events are sometimes announced as if they were
already passed. For it is3144 consistent with Deity to regard as accomplished facts whatever
It has determined on, because there is no difference of time with that Being in whom
eternity itself directs a uniform condition of seasons. It is indeed more natural3145 to the
prophetic divination to represent as seen and already brought to pass,3146 even while
forseeing it, that which it foresees; in other words, that which is by all means future. As for
instance, in Isaiah: “I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks (I exposed) to their hands.
I hid not my face from shame and spitting.”3147 For whether it was Christ even then, as we
hold, or the prophet, as the Jews say, who pronounced these words concerning himself, in
either case, that which as yet had not happened sounded as if it had been already accomplished.
Another characteristic will be, that very many events are figuratively predicted by
means of enigmas and allegories and parables, and that they must be understood in a sense
different from the literal description. For we both read of “the mountains dropping down
new wine,”3148 but not as if one might expect “must” from the stones, or its decoction from
the rocks; and also hear of “a land flowing with milk and honey,”3149 but not as if you were
to suppose that you would ever gather Samian cakes from the ground; nor does God, forsooth,
offer His services as a water-bailiff or a farmer when He says, “I will open rivers in a land;

I will plant in the wilderness the cedar and the box-tree.”3150 In like manner, when, foretelling
the conversion of the Gentiles, He says, “The beasts of the field shall honour me, the dragons
and the owls,” He surely never meant to derive3151 His fortunate omens from the young of
birds and foxes, and from the songsters of marvel and fable. But why enlarge on such a
subject? When the very apostle whom our heretics adopt,3152 interprets the law which allows
an unmuzzled mouth to the oxen that tread out the corn, not of cattle, but of ourselves;3153
and also alleges that the rock which followed (the Israelites) and supplied them with drink
was Christ;3154 teaching the Galatians, moreover, that the two narratives of the sons of Abraham
had an allegorical meaning in their course;3155 and to the Ephesians giving an intimation
that, when it was declared in the beginning that a man should leave his father and
mother and become one flesh with his wife, he applied this to Christ and the church.3156</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—Community in Certain Points of Marcionite and Jewish Error.
Prophecies of Christ’s Rejection Examined.</head>
<p>Since, therefore, there clearly exist these two characteristics in the Jewish prophetic literature,
let the reader remember,3157 whenever we adduce any evidence therefrom, that, by
mutual consent,3158 the point of discussion is not the form of the scripture, but the subject
it is called in to prove. When, therefore, our heretics in their phrenzy presumed to say that
that Christ was come who had never been fore-announced, it followed that, on their assump-
tion, that Christ had not yet appeared who had always been predicted; and thus they are
obliged to make common cause with3159 Jewish error, and construct their arguments with
its assistance, on the pretence that the Jews were themselves quite certain that it was some
other who came: so they not only rejected Him as a stranger, but slew Him as an enemy,
although they would without doubt have acknowledged Him, and with all religious devotion
followed Him, if He had only been one of themselves. Our shipmaster3160 of course got his
craft-wisdom not from the Rhodian law,3161 but from the Pontic,3162 which cautioned him
against believing that the Jews had no right to sin against their Christ; whereas (even if
nothing like their conduct had been predicted against them) human nature alone, liable to
error as it is, might well have induced him to suppose that it was quite possible for the Jews
to have committed such a sin, considered as men, without assuming any unfair prejudice
regarding their feelings, whose sin was antecedently so credible. Since, however, it was actually
foretold that they would not acknowledge Christ, and therefore would even put Him to
death, it will therefore follow that He was both ignored3163 and slain by them, who were
beforehand pointed out as being about to commit such offences against Him. If you require
a proof of this, instead of turning out those passages of Scripture which, while they declare
Christ to be capable of suffering death, do thereby also affirm the possibility of His being
rejected (for if He had not been rejected, He could not really suffer anything), but rather
reserving them for the subject of His sufferings, I shall content myself at the present moment
with adducing those which simply show that there was a probability of Christ’s rejection.
This is quickly done, since the passages indicate that the entire power of understanding was
by the Creator taken from the people. “I will take away,” says He, “the wisdom of their wise

ear ye shall hear, and not understand; and with your eyes ye shall see, but not perceive: for
the heart of this people hath growth fat, and with their ears they hear heavily, and their eyes
have they shut; lest they hear with their ears, and see with their eyes, and understand with
the heart, and be converted, and I heal them.”3165 Now this blunting of their sound senses
they had brought on themselves, loving God with their lips, but keeping far away from Him
in their heart. Since, then, Christ was announced by the Creator, “who formeth the lightning,
and createth the wind, and declareth unto man His Christ,” as the prophet Joel says,3166
since the entire hope of the Jews, not to say of the Gentiles too, was fixed on the manifestation
of Christ,—it was demonstrated that they, by their being deprived of those powers of
knowledge and understanding—wisdom and prudence, would fail to know and understand
that which was predicted, even Christ; when the chief of their wise men should be in error
respecting Him—that is to say, their scribes and prudent ones, or Pharisees; and when the
people, like them, should hear with their ears and not understand Christ while teaching
them, and see with their eyes and not perceive Christ, although giving them signs. Similarly
it is said elsewhere: “Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, but he who ruleth over them?”3167
Also when He upbraids them by the same Isaiah: “I have nourished and brought up children,
and they have rebelled against me. The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib:
but Israel doth not know; my people doth not consider.”3168 We indeed, who know for
certain that Christ always spoke in the prophets, as the Spirit of the Creator (for so says the
prophet: “The person of our Spirit, Christ the Lord,”3169 who from the beginning was both
heard and seen as the Father’s vicegerent in the name of God), are well aware that His words,
when actually upbraiding Israel, were the same as those which it was foretold that He should
denounce against him: “Ye have forsaken the Lord, and have provoked the Holy One of Israel
to anger.”3170 If, however, you would rather refer to God Himself, instead of to Christ, the

whole imputation of Jewish ignorance from the first, through an unwillingness to allow that
even anciently3171 the Creator’s word and Spirit—that is to say, His Christ—was despised
and not acknowledged by them, you will even in this subterfuge be defeated. For when you
do not deny that the Creator’s Son and Spirit and Substance is also His Christ, you must
needs allow that those who have not acknowledged the Father have failed likewise to acknowledge
the Son through the identity of their natural substance;3172 for if in Its fulness It has
baffled man’s understanding, much more has a portion of It, especially when partaking of
the fulness.3173 Now, when these things are carefully considered, it becomes evident how
the Jews both rejected Christ and slew Him; not because they regarded Him as a strange
Christ, but because they did not acknowledge Him, although their own. For how could they
have understood the strange One, concerning whom nothing had ever been announced,
when they failed to understand Him about whom there had been a perpetual course of
prophecy? That admits of being understood or being not understood, which, by possessing
a substantial basis for prophecy,3174 will also have a subject-matter3175 for either knowledge
or error; whilst that which lacks such matter admits not the issue of wisdom. So that it was
not as if He belonged to another3176 god that they conceived an aversion for Christ, and
persecuted Him, but simply as a man whom they regarded as a wonder-working juggler,3177
and an enemy3178 in His doctrines. They brought Him therefore to trial as a mere man, and
one of themselves too—that is, a Jew (only a renegade and a destroyer of Judaism)—and
punished Him according to their law. If He had been a stranger, indeed, they would not
have sat in judgment over Him. So far are they from appearing to have understood Him to
be a strange Christ, that they did not even judge Him to be a stranger to their own human
nature.3179</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—Prophecy Sets Forth Two Different Conditions of Christ, One Lowly,
the Other Majestic. This Fact Points to Two Advents of Christ.</head>
<p>Our heretic will now have the fullest opportunity of learning the clue3180 of his errors
along with the Jew himself, from whom he has borrowed his guidance in this discussion.
Since, however, the blind leads the blind, they fall into the ditch together. We affirm that,
as there are two conditions demonstrated by the prophets to belong to Christ, so these
presignified the same number of advents; one, and that the first, was to be in lowliness,3181
when He had to be led as a sheep to be slain as a victim, and to be as a lamb dumb before
the shearer, not opening His mouth, and not fair to look upon.3182 For, says (the prophet),
we have announced concerning Him: “He is like a tender plant,3183 like a root out of a
thirsty ground; He hath no form nor comeliness; and we beheld Him, and He was without
beauty: His form was disfigured;”3184 “marred more than the sons of men; a man stricken
with sorrows, and knowing how to bear our infirmity;”3185 “placed by the Father as a stone
of stumbling and a rock of offence;”3186 “made by Him a little lower than the angels;”3187
declaring Himself to be “a worm and not a man, a reproach of men, and despised of the
people.”3188 Now these signs of degradation quite suit His first coming, just as the tokens
of His majesty do His second advent, when He shall no longer remain “a stone of stumbling
and a rock of offence,” but after His rejection become “the chief corner-stone,” accepted
and elevated to the top place3189 of the temple, even His church, being that very stone in
Daniel, cut out of the mountain, which was to smite and crush the image of the secular
kingdom.3190 Of this advent the same prophet says: “Behold, one like the Son of man came
with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days; and they brought Him before
Him, and there was given Him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations,
and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not
pass away; and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.”3191 Then indeed He shall

have both a glorious form, and an unsullied beauty above the sons of men. “Thou art fairer,”
says (the Psalmist), “than the children of men; grace is poured into Thy lips; therefore God
hath blessed Thee for ever. Gird Thy sword upon Thy thigh, O most mighty, with Thy glory
and Thy majesty.”3192 For the Father, after making Him a little lower than the angels, “will
crown Him with glory and honour, and put all things under His feet.”3193 “Then shall they
look on Him whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for Him, tribe after tribe;”3194
because, no doubt, they once refused to acknowledge Him in the lowliness of His human
condition. He is even a man, says Jeremiah, and who shall recognise Him. Therefore, asks
Isaiah, “who shall declare His generation?”3195 So also in Zechariah, Christ Jesus, the true
High Priest of the Father, in the person of Joshua, nay, in the very mystery of His name,3196
is portrayed in a twofold dress with reference to both His advents. At first He is clad in
sordid garments, that is to say, in the lowliness of suffering and mortal flesh: then the devil
resisted Him, as the instigator of the traitor Judas, not to mention his tempting Him after
His baptism: afterwards He was stripped of His first filthy raiment, and adorned with the
priestly robe3197 and mitre, and a pure diadem;3198 in other words, with the glory and
honour of His second advent.3199 If I may offer, moreover, an interpretation of the two
goats which were presented on “the great day of atonement,”3200 do they not also figure the
two natures of Christ? They were of like size, and very similar in appearance, owing to the
Lord’s identity of aspect; because He is not to come in any other form, having to be recognised
by those by whom He was also wounded and pierced. One of these goats was bound3201
with scarlet,3202 and driven by the people out of the camp3203 into the wilderness,3204 amid
cursing, and spitting, and pulling, and piercing,3205 being thus marked with all the signs of

the Lord’s own passion; while the other, by being offered up for sins, and given to the priests
of the temple for meat, afforded proofs of His second appearance, when (after all sins have
been expiated) the priests of the spiritual temple, that is, the church, are to enjoy the flesh,
as it were,3206 of the Lord’s own grace, whilst the residue go away from salvation without
tasting it.3207 Since, therefore, the first advent was prophetically declared both as most obscure
in its types, and as deformed with every kind of indignity, but the second as glorious
and altogether worthy of God, they would on this very account, while confining their regards
to that which they were easily able both to understand and to believe, even the second advent,
be not undeservedly deceived respecting the more obscure, and, at any rate, the more lowly
first coming. Accordingly, to this day they deny that their Christ has come, because He has
not appeared in majesty, while they ignore the fact that He was to come also in lowliness.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Absurdity of Marcion’s Docetic Opinions; Reality of Christ’s Incarnation.</head>
<p>Our heretic must now cease to borrow poison from the Jew—“the asp,” as the adage
runs, “from the viper”3208—and henceforth vomit forth the virulence of his own disposition,
as when he alleges Christ to be a phantom. Except, indeed, that this opinion of his will be
sure to have others to maintain it in his precocious and somewhat abortive Marcionites,
whom the Apostle John designated as antichrists, when they denied that Christ was come
in the flesh; not that they did this with the view of establishing the right of the other god
(for on this point also they had been branded by the same apostle), but because they had
started with assuming the incredibility of an incarnate God. Now, the more firmly the antichrist
Marcion had seized this assumption, the more prepared was he, of course, to reject
the bodily substance of Christ, since he had introduced his very god to our notice as neither
the author nor the restorer of the flesh; and for this very reason, to be sure, as pre-eminently
good, and most remote from the deceits and fallacies of the Creator. His Christ, therefore,
in order to avoid all such deceits and fallacies, and the imputation, if possible, of belonging
to the Creator, was not what he appeared to be, and feigned himself to be what he was
not—incarnate without being flesh, human without being man, and likewise a divine Christ
without being God! But why should he not have propagated also the phantom of God? Can
I believe him on the subject of the internal nature, who was all wrong touching the external
substance? How will it be possible to believe him true on a mystery, when he has been found
so false on a plain fact? How, moreover, when he confounds the truth of the spirit with the
error of the flesh,3209 could he combine within himself that communion of light and darkness,
or truth and error, which the apostle says cannot co-exist?3210 Since however, Christ’s being
flesh is now discovered to be a lie, it follows that all things which were done by the flesh of
Christ were done untruly,3211—every act of intercourse,3212 of contact, of eating or drinking,
3213 yea, His very miracles. If with a touch, or by being touched, He freed any one of a
disease, whatever was done by any corporeal act cannot be believed to have been truly done
in the absence of all reality in His body itself. Nothing substantial can be allowed to have
been effected by an unsubstantial thing; nothing full by a vacuity. If the habit were putative,
the action was putative; if the worker were imaginary, the works were imaginary. On this

principle, too, the sufferings of Christ will be found not to warrant faith in Him. For He
suffered nothing who did not truly suffer; and a phantom could not truly suffer. God’s entire
work, therefore, is subverted. Christ’s death, wherein lies the whole weight and fruit of the
Christian name, is denied although the apostle asserts3214 it so expressly3215 as undoubtedly
real, making it the very foundation of the gospel, of our salvation and of his own preaching.
3216 “I have delivered unto you before all things,” says he, “how that Christ died for our
sins, and that he was buried, and that He rose again the third day.” Besides, if His flesh is
denied, how is His death to be asserted; for death is the proper suffering of the flesh, which
returns through death back to the earth out of which it was taken, according to the law of
its Maker? Now, if His death be denied, because of the denial of His flesh, there will be no
certainty of His resurrection. For He rose not, for the very same reason that He died not,
even because He possessed not the reality of the flesh, to which as death accrues, so does
resurrection likewise. Similarly, if Christ’s resurrection be nullified, ours also is destroyed.
If Christ’s resurrection be not realized,3217 neither shall that be for which Christ came. For
just as they, who said that there is no resurrection of the dead, are refuted by the apostle
from the resurrection of Christ, so, if the resurrection of Christ falls to the ground, the resurrection
of the dead is also swept away.3218 And so our faith is vain, and vain also is the
preaching of the apostles. Moreover, they even show themselves to be false witnesses of
God, because they testified that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise. And we remain
in our sins still.3219 And those who have slept in Christ have perished; destined, forsooth,3220
to rise again, but peradventure in a phantom state,3221 just like Christ.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—Refutation of Marcion’s Objections Derived from the Cases of the
Angels, and the Pre-Incarnate Manifestations of the Son of God.</head>
<p>Now, in this discussion of yours,3222 when you suppose that we are to be met with the
case of the Creator’s angels, as if they held intercourse with Abraham and Lot in a phantom
state, that of merely putative flesh,3223 and yet did truly converse, and eat, and work, as they
had been commissioned to do, you will not, to begin with, be permitted to use as examples
the acts of that God whom you are destroying. For by how much you make your god a better
and more perfect being, by just so much will all examples be unsuitable to him of that God
from whom he totally differs, and without which difference he would not be at all better or
more perfect. But then, secondly, you must know that it will not be conceded to you, that
in the angels there was only a putative flesh, but one of a true and solid human substance.
For if (on your terms) it was no difficulty to him to manifest true sensations and actions in
a putative flesh, it was much more easy for him still to have assigned the true substance of
flesh to these true sensations and actions, as the proper maker and former thereof. But your
god, perhaps on the ground of his having produced no flesh at all, was quite right in introducing
the mere phantom of that of which he had been unable to produce the reality. My
God, however, who formed that which He had taken out of the dust of the ground in the
true quality of flesh, although not issuing as yet from conjugal seed, was equally able to apply
to angels too a flesh of any material whatsoever, who built even the world out of nothing,
into so many and so various bodies, and that at a word! And, really, if your god promises
to men some time or other the true nature of angels3224 (for he says, “They shall be like the
angels”), why should not my God also have fitted on to angels the true substance of men,
from whatever source derived? For not even you will tell me, in reply, whence is obtained
that angelic nature on your side; so that it is enough for me to define this as being fit and
proper to God, even the verity of that thing which was objective to three senses—sight,
touch, and hearing. It is more difficult for God to practise deception3225 than to produce
real flesh from any material whatever, even without the means of birth. But for other heretics,
also, who maintain that the flesh in the angels ought to have been born of flesh, if it had
been really human, we have an answer on a sure principle, to the effect that it was truly human
flesh, and yet not born. It was truly human, because of the truthfulness of God, who can
neither lie nor deceive, and because (angelic beings) cannot be dealt with by men in a human
way except in human substance: it was withal unborn, because none3226 but Christ could

become incarnate by being born of the flesh in order that by His own nativity He might regenerate3227
our birth, and might further by His death also dissolve our death, by rising
again in that flesh in which, that He might even die, He was born. Therefore on that occasion
He did Himself appear with the angels to Abraham in the verity of the flesh, which had not
as yet undergone birth, because it was not yet going to die, although it was even now learning
to hold intercourse amongst men. Still greater was the propriety in angels, who never received
a dispensation to die for us, not having assumed even a brief experience3228 of flesh by being
born, because they were not destined to lay it down again by dying; but, from whatever
quarter they obtained it, and by what means soever they afterwards entirely divested themselves
of it, they yet never pretended it to be unreal flesh. Since the Creator “maketh His
angels spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire”—as truly spirits as also fire—so has He truly
made them flesh likewise; wherefore we can now recall to our own minds, and remind the
heretics also, that He has promised that He will one day form men into angels, who once
formed angels into men.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—The Truly Incarnate State More Worthy of God Than Marcion’s
Fantastic Flesh.</head>
<p>Therefore, since you are not permitted to resort to any instances of the Creator, as alien
from the subject, and possessing special causes of their own, I should like you to state
yourself the design of your god, in exhibiting his Christ not in the reality of flesh. If he despised
it as earthly, and (as you express it) full of dung,3229 why did he not on that account
include the likeness of it also in his contempt? For no honour is to be attributed to the image
of anything which is itself unworthy of honour. As the natural state is, so will the likeness
be. But how could he hold converse with men except in the image of human substance?3230
Why, then, not rather in the reality thereof, that his intercourse might be real, since he was
under the necessity of holding it? And to how much better account would this necessity
have been turned by ministering to faith rather than to a fraud!3231 The god whom you
make is miserable enough, for this very reason that he was unable to display his Christ except
in the effigy of an unworthy, and indeed an alien, thing. In some instances, it will be convenient
to use even unworthy things, if they be only our own, as it will also be quite improper
to use things, be they ever so worthy, if they be not our own.3232 Why, then, did he not come
in some other worthier substance, and especially his own, that he might not seem as if he
could not have done without an unworthy and an alien one? Now, since my Creator held
intercourse with man by means of even a bush and fire, and again afterwards by means of
a cloud and column,3233 and in representations of Himself used bodies composed of the
elements, these examples of divine power afford sufficient proof that God did not require
the instrumentality of false or even of real flesh. But yet, if we look steadily into the subject,
there is really no substance which is worthy of becoming a vestment for God. Whatsoever
He is pleased to clothe Himself withal, He makes worthy of Himself—only without untruth.
3234 Therefore how comes it to pass that he should have thought the verity of the flesh,
rather than its unreality, a disgrace? Well, but he honoured it by his fiction of it. How great,
then, is that flesh, the very phantasy of which was a necessity to the superior God!</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—Christ Was Truly Born; Marcion’s Absurd Cavil in Defence of a Putative
Nativity.</head>
<p>All these illusions of an imaginary corporeity3235 in (his) Christ, Marcion adopted with
this view, that his nativity also might not be furnished with any evidence from his human
substance, and that thus the Christ of the Creator might be free to have assigned to Him all
predictions which treated of Him as one capable of human birth, and therefore fleshly. But
most foolishly did our Pontic heresiarch act in this too. As if it would not be more readily
believed that flesh in the Divine Being should rather be unborn than untrue, this belief
having in fact had the way mainly prepared for it by the Creator’s angels when they conversed
in flesh which was real, although unborn. For indeed the notorious Philumena3236 persuaded
Apelles and the other seceders from Marcion rather to believe that Christ did really carry
about a body of flesh; not derived to Him, however, from birth, but one which He borrowed
from the elements. Now, as Marcion was apprehensive that a belief of the fleshly body would
also involve a belief of birth, undoubtedly He who seemed to be man was believed to be
verily and indeed born. For a certain woman had exclaimed, “Blessed is the womb that bare
Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked!”3237 And how else could they have said that
His mother and His brethren were standing without?3238 But we shall see more of this in
the proper place.3239 Surely, when He also proclaimed Himself as the Son of man, He,
without doubt, confessed that He had been born. Now I would rather refer all these points
to an examination of the gospel; but still, as I have already stated, if he, who seemed to be
man, had by all means to pass as having been born, it was vain for him to suppose that faith
in his nativity was to be perfected3240 by the device of an imaginary flesh. For what advantage
was there in that being not true which was held to be true, whether it were his flesh or his
birth? Or if you should say, let human opinion go for nothing;3241 you are then honouring
your god under the shelter of a deception, since he knew himself to be something different
from what he had made men to think of him. In that case you might possibly have assigned

to him a putative nativity even, and so not have hung the question on this point. For silly
women fancy themselves pregnant sometimes, when they are corpulent3242 either from
their natural flux3243 or from some other malady. And, no doubt, it had become his duty,
since he had put on the mere mask of his substance, to act out from its earliest scene the
play of his phantasy, lest he should have failed in his part at the beginning of the flesh. You
have, of course,3244 rejected the sham of a nativity, and have produced true flesh itself. And,
no doubt, even the real nativity of a God is a most mean thing.3245 Come then, wind up
your cavils3246 against the most sacred and reverend works of nature; inveigh against all
that you are; destroy the origin of flesh and life; call the womb a sewer of the illustrious animal—
in other words, the manufactory for the production of man; dilate on the impure and
shameful tortures of parturition, and then on the filthy, troublesome, contemptible issues
of the puerperal labour itself! But yet, after you have pulled all these things down to infamy,
that you may affirm them to be unworthy of God, birth will not be worse for Him than
death, infancy than the cross, punishment than nature, condemnation than the flesh. If
Christ truly suffered all this, to be born was a less thing for Him. If Christ suffered evasively,
3247 as a phantom; evasively, too, might He have been born. Such are Marcion’s chief
arguments by which he makes out another Christ; and I think that we show plainly enough
that they are utterly irrelevant, when we teach how much more truly consistent with God
is the reality rather than the falsehood of that condition3248 in which He manifested His
Christ. Since He was “the truth,” He was flesh; since He was flesh, He was born. For the
points which this heresy assaults are confirmed, when the means of the assault are destroyed.
Therefore if He is to be considered in the flesh,3249 because He was born; and born, because
He is in the flesh, and because He is no phantom,—it follows that He must be acknowledged
as Himself the very Christ of the Creator, who was by the Creator’s prophets foretold as
about to come in the flesh, and by the process of human birth.3250</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Isaiah’s Prophecy of Emmanuel. Christ Entitled to that Name.</head>
<p>And challenge us first, as is your wont, to consider Isaiah’s description of Christ, while
you contend that in no point does it suit. For, to begin with, you say that Isaiah’s Christ will
have to be called Emmanuel;3251 then, that He takes the riches of Damascus and the spoils
of Samaria against the king of Assyria.3252 But yet He who is come was neither born under
such a name, nor ever engaged in any warlike enterprise. I must, however, remind you that
you ought to look into the contexts3253 of the two passages. For there is immediately added
the interpretation of Emmanuel, “God with us;” so that you have to consider not merely
the name as it is uttered, but also its meaning. The utterance is Hebrew, Emmanuel, of the
prophet’s own nation; but the meaning of the word, God with us, is by the interpretation
made common property. Inquire, then, whether this name, God-with-us, which is Emmanuel,
be not often used for the name of Christ,3254 from the fact that Christ has enlightened the
world. And I suppose you will not deny it, inasmuch as you do yourself admit that He is
called God-with-us, that is, Emmanuel. Else if you are so foolish, that, because with you He
gets the designation God-with-us, not Emmanuel, you therefore are unwilling to grant that
He is come whose property it is to be called Emmanuel, as if this were not the same name
as God-with-us, you will find among the Hebrew Christians, and amongst Marcionites too,
that they name Him Emmanuel when they mean Him to be called God-with-us; just indeed
as every nation, by whatever word they would express God-with-us, has called Him Emmanuel,
completing the sound in its sense. Now since Emmanuel is God-with-us, and Godwith-
us is Christ, who is in us (for “as many of you as are baptized into Christ, have put on
Christ”3255), Christ is as properly implied in the meaning of the name, which is God-withus,
as He is in the pronunciation of the name, which is Emmanuel. And thus it is evident
that He is now come who was foretold as Emmanuel, because what Emmanuel signifies is
come, that is to say, God-with-us.</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—Isaiah’s Prophecies Considered. The Virginity of Christ’s Mother a
Sign. Other Prophecies Also Signs. Metaphorical Sense of Proper Names in
Sundry Passages of the Prophets.</head>
<p>You are equally led away by the sound of names,3256 when you so understand the riches
of Damascus, and the spoils of Samaria, and the king of Assyria, as if they portended that
the Creator’s Christ was a warrior, not attending to the promise contained in the passage,
“For before the Child shall have knowledge to cry, My father and My mother, He shall take
away the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria before the king of Assyria.”3257 You
should first examine the point of age, whether it can be taken to represent Christ as even
yet a man,3258 much less a warrior. Although, to be sure, He might be about to call to arms
by His cry as an infant; might be about to sound the alarm of war not with a trumpet, but
with a little rattle; might be about to seek His foe, not on horseback, or in chariot, or from
parapet, but from nurse’s neck or nursemaid’s back, and so be destined to subjugate Damascus
and Samaria from His mother’s breasts! It is a different matter, of course, when the
babes of your barbarian Pontus spring forth to the fight. They are, I ween, taught to lance
before they lacerate;3259 swathed at first in sunshine and ointment,3260 afterwards armed
with the satchel,3261 and rationed on bread and butter!3262 Now, since nature, certainly,
nowhere grants to man to learn warfare before life, to pillage the wealth of a Damascus before
he knows his father and mother’s name, it follows that the passage in question must be
deemed to be a figurative one. Well, but nature, says he, does not permit “a virgin to conceive,”
and still the prophet is believed. And indeed very properly; for he has paved the way
for the incredible thing being believed, by giving a reason for its occurrence, in that it was
to be for a sign. “Therefore,” says he, “the Lord himself shall give you a sign; behold, a virgin
shall conceive, and bear a son.”3263 Now a sign from God would not have been a sign,3264
unless it had been some novel and prodigious thing. Then, again, Jewish cavillers, in order
to disconcert us, boldly pretend that Scripture does not hold3265 that a virgin, but only a

young woman,3266 is to conceive and bring forth. They are, however, refuted by this consideration,
that nothing of the nature of a sign can possibly come out of what is a daily occurrence,
the pregnancy and child-bearing of a young woman. A virgin mother is justly
deemed to be proposed3267 by God as a sign, but a warlike infant has no like claim to the
distinction; for even in such a case3268 there does not occur the character of a sign. But
after the sign of the strange and novel birth has been asserted, there is immediately afterwards
declared as a sign the subsequent course of the Infant,3269 who was to eat butter and honey.
Not that this indeed is of the nature of a sign, nor is His “refusing the evil;” for this, too, is
only a characteristic of infancy.3270 But His destined capture of the riches of Damascus and
the spoil of Samaria before the king of Assyria is no doubt a wonderful sign.3271 Keep to the
measure of His age, and seek the purport of the prophecy, and give back also to the truth
of the gospel what you have taken away from it in the lateness of your heresy,3272 and the
prophecy at once becomes intelligible and declares its own accomplishment. Let those
eastern magi wait on the new-born Christ, presenting to Him, (although) in His infancy,
their gifts of gold and frankincense; and surely an Infant will have received the riches of
Damascus without a battle, and unarmed.</p>
<p>For besides the generally known fact, that the riches of the East, that is to say, its strength
and resources, usually consist of gold and spices, it is certainly true of the Creator, that He
makes gold the riches of the other3273 nations also. Thus He says by Zechariah: “And Judah
shall also fight at Jerusalem and shall gather together all the wealth of the nations round
about, gold and silver.”3274 Moreover, respecting that gift of gold, David also says: “And
there shall be given to Him of the gold of Arabia;”3275 and again: “The kings of Arabia and

Saba shall offer to Him gifts.”3276 For the East generally regarded the magi as kings; and
Damascus was anciently deemed to belong to Arabia, before it was transferred to
Syrophoenicia on the division of the Syrias (by Rome).3277 Its riches Christ then received,
when He received the tokens thereof in the gold and spices; while the spoils of Samaria were
the magi themselves. These having discovered Him and honoured Him with their gifts, and
on bended knee adored Him as their God and King, through the witness of the star which
led their way and guided them, became the spoils of Samaria, that is to say, of idolatry, because,
as it is easy enough to see,3278 they believed in Christ. He designated idolatry under
the name of Samaria, as that city was shameful for its idolatry, through which it had then
revolted from God from the days of king Jeroboam. Nor is this an unusual manner for the
Creator, (in His Scriptures3279) figuratively to employ names of places as a metaphor derived
from the analogy of their sins. Thus He calls the chief men of the Jews “rulers of Sodom,”
and the nation itself “people of Gomorrah.”3280 And in another passage He also says: “Thy
father was an Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite,”3281 by reason of their kindred iniquity;3282
although He had actually called them His sons: “I have nourished and brought up children.”
3283 So likewise by Egypt is sometimes understood, in His sense,3284 the whole world
as being marked out by superstition and a curse.3285 By a similar usage Babylon also in our
(St.) John is a figure of the city of Rome, as being like (Babylon) great and proud in royal
power, and warring down the saints of God. Now it was in accordance with this style that
He called the magi by the name of Samaritans, because (as we have said) they had practised
idolatry as did the Samaritans. Moreover, by the phrase “before or against the king of Assyria,”
understand “against Herod;” against whom the magi then opposed themselves, when
they refrained from carrying him back word concerning Christ, whom he was seeking to
destroy.</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—Figurative Style of Certain Messianic Prophecies in the Psalms.
Military Metaphors Applied to Christ.</head>
<p>This interpretation of ours will derive confirmation, when, on your supposing that
Christ is in any passage called a warrior, from the mention of certain arms and expressions
of that sort, you weigh well the analogy of their other meanings, and draw your conclusions
accordingly. “Gird on Thy sword,” says David, “upon Thy thigh.”3286 But what do you read
about Christ just before? “Thou art fairer than the children of men; grace is poured forth
upon Thy lips.”3287 It amuses me to imagine that blandishments of fair beauty and graceful
lips are ascribed to one who had to gird on His sword for war! So likewise, when it is added,
“Ride on prosperously in Thy majesty,”3288 the reason is subjoined: “Because of truth, and
meekness, and righteousness.”3289 But who shall produce these results with the sword, and
not their opposites rather—deceit, and harshness, and injury—which, it must be confessed,
are the proper business of battles? Let us see, therefore, whether that is not some other sword,
which has so different an action. Now the Apostle John, in the Apocalypse, describes a sword
which proceeded from the mouth of God as “a doubly sharp, two-edged one.”3290 This may
be understood to be the Divine Word, who is doubly edged with the two testaments of the
law and the gospel—sharpened with wisdom, hostile to the devil, arming us against the
spiritual enemies of all wickedness and concupiscence, and cutting us off from the dearest
objects for the sake of God’s holy name. If, however, you will not acknowledge John, you
have our common master Paul, who “girds our loins about with truth, and puts on us the
breastplate of righteousness, and shoes us with the preparation of the gospel of peace, not
of war; who bids us take the shield of faith, wherewith we may be able to quench all the fiery
darts of the devil, and the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which (he says)
is the word of God.”3291 This sword the Lord Himself came to send on earth, and not
peace.3292 If he is your Christ, then even he is a warrior. If he is not a warrior, and the sword
he brandishes is an allegorical one, then the Creator’s Christ in the psalm too may have been
girded with the figurative sword of the Word, without any martial gear. The above-mentioned
“fairness” of His beauty and “grace of His lips” would quite suit such a sword, girt as it even
then was upon His thigh in the passage of David, and sent as it would one day be by Him

on earth. For this is what He says: “Ride on prosperously in Thy majesty3293”—advancing
His word into every land, so as to call all nations: destined to prosper in the success of that
faith which received Him, and reigning, from the fact that3294 He conquered death by His
resurrection. “Thy right hand,” says He, “shall wonderfully lead Thee forth,”3295 even the
might of Thy spiritual grace, whereby the knowledge of Christ is spread. “Thine arrows are
sharp;”3296 everywhere Thy precepts fly about, Thy threatenings also, and convictions3297
of heart, pricking and piercing each conscience. “The people shall fall under Thee,”3298 that
is, in adoration. Thus is the Creator’s Christ mighty in war, and a bearer of arms; thus also
does He now take the spoils, not of Samaria alone, but of all nations. Acknowledge, then,
that His spoils are figurative, since you have learned that His arms are allegorical. Since,
therefore, both the Lord speaks and His apostle writes such things3299 in a figurative style,
we are not rash in using His interpretations, the records3300 of which even our adversaries
admit; and thus in so far will it be Isaiah’s Christ who has come, in as far as He was not a
warrior, because it is not of such a character that He is described by Isaiah.</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—The Title Christ Suitable as a Name of the Creator’s Son, But Unsuited
to Marcion’s Christ.</head>
<p>Touching then the discussion of His flesh, and (through that) of His nativity, and incidentally3301
of His name Emmanuel, let this suffice. Concerning His other names, however,
and especially that of Christ, what has the other side to say in reply? If the name of Christ
is as common with you as is the name of God—so that as the Son of both Gods may be fitly
called Christ, so each of the Fathers may be called Lord—reason will certainly be opposed
to this argument. For the name of God, as being the natural designation of Deity, may be
ascribed to all those beings for whom a divine nature is claimed,—as, for instance, even to
idols. The apostle says: “For there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth.”3302
The name of Christ, however, does not arise from nature, but from dispensation;3303 and
so becomes the proper name of Him to whom it accrues in consequence of the dispensation.
Nor is it subject to be shared in by any other God, especially a rival, and one that has a dispensation
of His own, to whom it will be also necessary that He should possess names apart
from all others. For how happens it that, after they have devised different dispensations for
two Gods they admit into this diversity of dispensation a community of names; whereas no
proof could be more useful of two Gods being rival ones, than if there should be found coincident
with their (diverse) dispensations a diversity also of names? For that is not a state
of diverse qualities, which is not distinctly indicated3304 in the specific meanings3305 of their
designations. Whenever these are wanting, there occurs what the Greeks call the katachresis3306of
a term, by its improper application to what does not belong to it.3307 In God,
however, there ought, I suppose, to be no defect, no setting up of His dispensations by
katachrestic abuse of words. Who is this god, that claims for his son names from the Creator?
I say not names which do not belong to him, but ancient and well-known names, which
even in this view of them would be unsuitable for a novel and unknown god. How is it,
again, that he tells us that “a piece of new cloth is not sewed on to an old garment,” or that
“new wine is not trusted to old bottles,”3308 when he is himself patched and clad in an old

suit3309 of names? How is it he has rent off the gospel from the law, when he is wholly invested
with the law,—in the name, forsooth, of Christ? What hindered his calling himself by
some other name, seeing that he preached another (gospel), came from another source, and
refused to take on him a real body, for the very purpose that he might not be supposed to
be the Creator’s Christ? Vain, however, was his unwillingness to seem to be He whose name
he was willing to assume; since, even if he had been truly corporeal, he would more certainly
escape being taken for the Christ of the Creator, if he had not taken on him His name. But,
as it is, he rejects the substantial verity of Him whose name he has assumed, even though
he should give a proof of that verity by his name. For Christ means anointed, and to be
anointed is certainly an affair3310 of the body. He who had not a body, could not by any
possibility have been anointed; he who could not by any possibility have been anointed,
could not in any wise have been called Christ. It is a different thing (quite), if he only assumed
the phantom of a name too. But how, he asks, was he to insinuate himself into being believed
by the Jews, except through a name which was usual and familiar amongst them? Then ’tis
a fickle and tricksty God whom you describe! To promote any plan by deception, is the resource
of either distrust or of maliciousness. Much more frank and simple was the conduct
of the false prophets against the Creator, when they came in His name as their own God.3311
But I do not find that any good came of this proceeding,3312 since they were more apt to
suppose either that Christ was their own, or rather was some deceiver, than that He was the
Christ of the other god; and this the gospel will show.</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—The Sacred Name Jesus Most Suited to the Christ of the Creator.
Joshua a Type of Him.</head>
<p>Now if he caught at the name Christ, just as the pickpocket clutches the dole-basket,
why did he wish to be called Jesus too, by a name which was not so much looked for by the
Jews? For although we, who have by God’s grace attained to the understanding of His mysteries,
acknowledge that this name also was destined for Christ, yet, for all that, the fact was
not known to the Jews, from whom wisdom was taken away. To this day, in short, it is Christ
that they are looking for, not Jesus; and they interpret Elias to be Christ rather than Jesus.
He, therefore, who came also in a name in which Christ was not expected, might have come
only in that name which was solely anticipated for Him.3313 But since he has mixed up the
two,3314 the expected one and the unexpected, his twofold project is defeated. For if he be
Christ for the very purpose of insinuating himself as the Creator’s, then Jesus opposes him,
because Jesus was not looked for in the Christ of the Creator; or if he be Jesus, in order that
he might pass as belonging to the other (God), then Christ hinders him, because Christ was
not expected to belong to any other than the Creator. I know not which one of these names
may be able to hold its ground.3315 In the Christ of the Creator, however, both will keep
their place, for in Him a Jesus too is found. Do you ask, how? Learn it then here, with the
Jews also who are partakers of your heresy. When Oshea the son of Nun was destined to
be the successor of Moses, is not his old name then changed, and for the first time he is
called3316 Joshua? It is true, you say. This, then, we first observe, was a figure of Him who
was to come. For inasmuch as Jesus Christ was to introduce a new generation3317 (because
we are born in the wilderness of this world) into the promised land which flows with milk
and honey, that is, into the possession of eternal life, than which nothing can be sweeter;
inasmuch, too, as this was to be brought about not by Moses, that is to say, not by the discipline
of the law, but by Joshua, by the grace of the gospel, our circumcision being effected
by a knife of stone, that is, (by the circumcision) of Christ, for Christ is a rock (or stone),
therefore that great man,3318 who was ordained as a type of this mystery, was actually consecrated
with the figure of the Lord’s own name, being called Joshua. This name Christ
Himself even then testified to be His own, when He talked with Moses. For who was it that
talked with him, but the Spirit of the Creator, which is Christ? When He therefore spake
this commandment to the people, “Behold, I send my angel before thy face, to keep thee in

the way, and to bring thee into the land which I have prepared for thee; attend to him, and
obey his voice and do not provoke him; for he has not shunned you,3319 since my name is
upon him,”3320 He called him an angel indeed, because of the greatness of the powers which
he was to exercise, and because of his prophetic office,3321 while announcing the will of
God; but Joshua also (Jesus), because it was a type3322 of His own future name. Often3323
did He confirm that name of His which He had thus conferred upon (His servant); because
it was not the name of angel, nor Oshea, but Joshua (Jesus), which He had commanded him
to bear as his usual appellation for the time to come. Since, therefore, both these names are
suitable to the Christ of the Creator, they are proportionately unsuitable to the non-Creator’s
Christ; and so indeed is all the rest of (our Christ’s) destined course.3324 In short, there must
now for the future be made between us that certain and equitable rule, necessary to both
sides, which shall determine that there ought to be absolutely nothing at all in common
between the Christ of the other god and the Creator’s Christ. For you will have as great a
necessity to maintain their diversity as we have to resist it, inasmuch as you will be as unable
to show that the Christ of the other god has come, until you have proved him to be a far
different being from the Creator’s Christ, as we, to claim Him (who has come) as the Creator’s,
until we have shown Him to be such a one as the Creator has appointed. Now respecting
their names, such is our conclusion against (Marcion).3325 I claim for myself Christ; I
maintain for myself Jesus.</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.—Prophecies in Isaiah and the Psalms Respecting Christ’s Humiliation.</head>
<p>Let us compare with Scripture the rest of His dispensation. Whatever that poor despised
body3326 may be, because it was an object of touch3327 and sight,3328 it shall be my Christ,
be He inglorious, be He ignoble, be He dishonoured; for such was it announced that He
should be, both in bodily condition and aspect. Isaiah comes to our help again: “We have
announced (His way) before Him,” says he; “He is like a servant,3329 like a root in a dry
ground; He hath no form nor comeliness; we saw Him, and He had neither form nor beauty;
but His form was despised, marred above all men.”3330 Similarly the Father addressed the
Son just before: “Inasmuch as many will be astonished at Thee, so also will Thy beauty be
without glory from men.”3331 For although, in David’s words, He is fairer than the children
of men,”3332 yet it is in that figurative state of spiritual grace, when He is girded with the
sword of the Spirit, which is verily His form, and beauty, and glory. According to the same
prophet, however, He is in bodily condition “a very worm, and no man; a reproach of men,
and an outcast of the people.”3333 But no internal quality of such a kind does He announce
as belonging to Him. In Him dwelt the fulness of the Spirit; therefore I acknowledge Him
to be “the rod of the stem of Jesse.” His blooming flower shall be my Christ, upon whom
hath rested, according to Isaiah, “the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of
counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of piety, and of the fear of the Lord.”3334
Now to no man, except Christ, would the diversity of spiritual proofs suitably apply. He is
indeed like a flower for the Spirit’s grace, reckoned indeed of the stem of Jesse, but thence
to derive His descent through Mary. Now I purposely demand of you, whether you grant
to Him the destination3335 of all this humiliation, and suffering, and tranquillity, from which
He will be the Christ of Isaiah,—a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief, who was led
as a sheep to the slaughter, and who, like a lamb before the shearer, opened not His

not the bruised reed—that is, the shattered faith of the Jews—nor quenched the smoking
flax—that is, the freshly-kindled3337 ardour of the Gentiles. He can be none other than the
Man who was foretold. It is right that His conduct3338 be investigated according to the rule
of Scripture, distinguishable as it is unless I am mistaken, by the twofold operation of
preaching3339 and of miracle. But the treatment of both these topics I shall so arrange as to
postpone, to the chapter wherein I have determined to discuss the actual gospel of Marcion,
the consideration of His wonderful doctrines and miracles—with a view, however, to our
present purpose. Let us here, then, in general terms complete the subject which we had
entered upon, by indicating, as we pass on,3340 how Christ was fore-announced by Isaiah
as a preacher: “For who is there among you,” says he, “that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth
the voice of His Son?”3341 And likewise as a healer: “For,” says he, “He hath taken away our
infirmities, and carried our sorrows.”3342</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.3343—Types of the Death of Christ. Isaac; Joseph; Jacob Against
Simeon and Levi; Moses Praying Against Amalek; The Brazen Serpent.</head>
<p>On the subject of His death,3344 I suppose, you endeavour to introduce a diversity of
opinion, simply because you deny that the suffering of the cross was predicted of the Christ
of the Creator, and because you contend, moreover, that it is not to be believed that the
Creator would expose His Son to that kind of death on which He had Himself pronounced
a curse. “Cursed,” says He, “is every one who hangeth on a tree.”3345 But what is meant by
this curse, worthy as it is of the simple prediction of the cross, of which we are now mainly
inquiring, I defer to consider, because in another passage3346 we have given the reason3347
of the thing preceded by proof. First, I shall offer a full explanation3348 of the types. And
no doubt it was proper that this mystery should be prophetically set forth by types, and indeed
chiefly by that method: for in proportion to its incredibility would it be a stumbling-block,
if it were set forth in bare prophecy; and in proportion too, to its grandeur, was the need of
obscuring it in shadow,3349 that the difficulty of understanding it might lead to prayer for
the grace of God. First, then, Isaac, when he was given up by his father as an offering, himself
carried the wood for his own death. By this act he even then was setting forth the death of
Christ, who was destined by His Father as a sacrifice, and carried the cross whereon He
suffered. Joseph likewise was a type of Christ, not indeed on this ground (that I may not
delay my course3350), that he suffered persecution for the cause of God from his brethren,
as Christ did from His brethren after the flesh, the Jews; but when he is blessed by his father
in these words: “His glory is that of a bullock; his horns are the horns of a unicorn; with
them shall he push the nations to the very ends of the earth,”3351—he was not, of course,

<note type="footnote">3350 But he may mean, by “ne demorer cursum,” “that I may not obstruct the course of the type,” by taking

designated as a mere unicorn with its one horn, or a minotaur with two; but Christ was indicated
in him—a bullock in respect of both His characteristics: to some as severe as a Judge,
to others gentle as a Saviour, whose horns were the extremities of His cross. For of the antenna,
which is a part of a cross, the ends are called horns; while the midway stake of the
whole frame is the unicorn. By this virtue, then, of His cross, and in this manner “horned,”
He is both now pushing all nations through faith, bearing them away from earth to heaven;
and will then push them through judgment, casting them down from heaven to earth. He
will also, according to another passage in the same scripture, be a bullock, when He is spiritually
interpreted to be Jacob against Simeon and Levi, which means against the scribes
and the Pharisees; for it was from them that these last derived their origin.3352 Like Simeon
and Levi, they consummated their wickedness by their heresy, with which they persecuted
Christ. “Into their counsel let not my soul enter; to their assembly let not my heart be united:
for in their anger they slew men,” that is, the prophets; “and in their self-will they hacked
the sinews of a bullock,”3353 that is, of Christ. For against Him did they wreak their fury
after they had slain His prophets, even by affixing Him with nails to the cross. Otherwise,
it is an idle thing3354 when, after slaying men, he inveighs against them for the torture of a
bullock! Again, in the case of Moses, wherefore did he at that moment particularly, when
Joshua was fighting Amalek, pray in a sitting posture with outstretched hands, when in such
a conflict it would surely have been more seemly to have bent the knee, and smitten the
breast, and to have fallen on the face to the ground, and in such prostration to have offered
prayer? Wherefore, but because in a battle fought in the name of that Lord who was one
day to fight against the devil, the shape was necessary of that very cross through which Jesus
was to win the victory? Why, once more, did the same Moses, after prohibiting the likeness
of everything, set up the golden serpent on the pole; and as it hung there, propose it as an
object to be looked at for a cure?3355 Did he not here also intend to show the power of our
Lord’s cross, whereby that old serpent the devil was vanquished,—whereby also to every
man who was bitten by spiritual serpents, but who yet turned with an eye of faith to it, was
proclaimed a cure from the bite of sin, and health for evermore?</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—Prophecies of the Death of Christ.</head>
<p>Come now, when you read in the words of David, how that “the Lord reigneth from
the tree,”3356 I want to know what you understand by it. Perhaps you think some wooden3357
king of the Jews is meant!—and not Christ, who overcame death by His suffering on the
cross, and thence reigned! Now, although death reigned from Adam even to Christ, why
may not Christ be said to have reigned from the tree, from His having shut up the kingdom
of death by dying upon the tree of His cross? Likewise Isaiah also says: “For unto us a child
is born.”3358 But what is there unusual in this, unless he speaks of the Son of God? “To us
is given He whose government is upon His shoulder.”3359 Now, what king is there who
bears the ensign of his dominion upon his shoulder, and not rather upon his head as a diadem,
or in his hand as a sceptre, or else as a mark in some royal apparel? But the one new
King of the new ages, Jesus Christ, carried on His shoulder both the power and the excellence
of His new glory, even His cross; so that, according to our former prophecy, He might
thenceforth reign from the tree as Lord. This tree it is which Jeremiah likewise gives you
intimation of, when he prophesies to the Jews, who should say, “Come, let us destroy the
tree with the fruit, (the bread) thereof,”3360 that is, His body. For so did God in your own
gospel even reveal the sense, when He called His body bread; so that, for the time to come,
you may understand that He has given to His body the figure of bread, whose body the
prophet of old figuratively turned into bread, the Lord Himself designing to give by and by
an interpretation of the mystery. If you require still further prediction of the Lord’s cross,
the twenty-first Psalm3361 is sufficiently able to afford it to you, containing as it does the
entire passion of Christ, who was even then prophetically declaring3362 His glory. “They
pierced,” says He, “my hands and my feet,”3363 which is the special cruelty of the cross.
And again, when He implores His Father’s help, He says, “Save me from the lion’s mouth,”
that is, the jaws of death, “and my humiliation from the horns of the unicorns;” in other
words, from the extremities of the cross, as we have shown above. Now, David himself did
not suffer this cross, nor did any other king of the Jews; so that you cannot suppose that this
is the prophecy of any other’s passion than His who alone was so notably crucified by the

nation. Now should the heretics, in their obstinacy,3364 reject and despise all these interpretations,
I will grant to them that the Creator has given us no signs of the cross of His
Christ; but they will not prove from this concession that He who was crucified was another
(Christ), unless they could somehow show that this death was predicted as His by their own
god, so that from the diversity of predictions there might be maintained to be a diversity of
sufferers,3365 and thereby also a diversity of persons. But since there is no prophecy of even
Marcion’s Christ, much less of his cross, it is enough for my Christ that there is a prophecy
merely of death. For, from the fact that the kind of death is not declared, it was possible for
the death of the cross to have been still intended, which would then have to be assigned to
another (Christ), if the prophecy had had reference to another. Besides,3366 if he should be
unwilling to allow that the death of my Christ was predicted, his confusion must be the
greater3367 if he announces that his own Christ indeed died, whom he denies to have had
a nativity, whilst denying that my Christ is mortal, though he allows Him to be capable of
birth. However, I will show him the death, and burial, and resurrection of my Christ all3368
indicated in a single sentence of Isaiah, who says, “His sepulture was removed from the
midst of them.” Now there could have been no sepulture without death, and no removal of
sepulture except by resurrection. Then, finally, he added: “Therefore He shall have many
for his inheritance, and He shall divide the spoil of the many, because He poured out His
soul unto death.”3369 For there is here set forth the cause of this favour to Him, even that
it was to recompense Him for His suffering of death. It was equally shown that He was to
obtain this recompense for His death, was certainly to obtain it after His death by means of
the resurrection.3370</p>

<head>Chapter XX.3371—The Subsequent Influence of Christ’s Death in the World Predicted.</head>
<p>The Sure Mercies of David. What These are.</p>
<p>It is sufficient for my purpose to have traced thus far the course of Christ’s dispensation
in these particulars. This has proved Him to be such a one as prophecy announced He should
be, so that He ought not to be regarded in any other character than that which prediction
assigned to Him; and the result of this agreement between the facts of His course and the
Scriptures of the Creator should be the restoration of belief in them from that prejudice
which has, by contributing to diversity of opinion, either thrown doubt upon, or led to a
denial of, a considerable part of them. And now we go further and build up the superstructure
of those kindred events3372 out of the Scriptures of the Creator which were predicted and
destined to happen after Christ. For the dispensation would not be found complete, if He
had not come after whom it had to run on its course.3373 Look at all nations from the vortex
of human error emerging out of it up to the Divine Creator, the Divine Christ, and deny
Him to be the object of prophecy, if you dare. At once there will occur to you the Father’s
promise in the Psalms: “Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten Thee. Ask of me, and I
shall give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for
Thy possession.”3374 You will not be able to put in a claim for some son of David being here
meant, rather than Christ; or for the ends of the earth being promised to David, whose
kingdom was confined to the Jewish nation simply, rather than to Christ, who now embraces
the whole world in the faith of His gospel. So again He says by Isaiah: “I have given Thee
for a dispensation of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind,”
that is, those that be in error, “to bring out the prisoners from the prison,” that is, to free
them from sin, “and from the prison-house,” that is, of death, “those that sit in darkness”—
even that of ignorance.3375 If these things are accomplished through Christ, they
would not have been designed in prophecy for any other than Him through whom they
have their accomplishment. In another passage He also says: “Behold, I have set Him as a
testimony to the nations, a prince and commander to the nations; nations which know Thee
not shall invoke Thee, and peoples shall run together unto Thee.”3376 You will not interpret
these words of David, because He previously said, “I will make an everlasting covenant with
you, even the sure mercies of David.”3377 Indeed, you will be obliged from these words all

the more to understand that Christ is reckoned to spring from David by carnal descent, by
reason of His birth3378 of the Virgin Mary. Touching this promise of Him, there is the oath
to David in the psalm, “Of the fruit of thy body3379 will I set upon thy throne.”3380 What
body is meant? David’s own? Certainly not. For David was not to give birth to a son.3381
Nor his wife’s either. For instead of saying, “Of the fruit of thy body,” he would then have
rather said, “Of the fruit of thy wife’s body.” But by mentioning his3382 body, it follows that
He pointed to some one of his race of whose body the flesh of Christ was to be the fruit,
which bloomed forth from3383 Mary’s womb. He named the fruit of the body (womb) alone,
because it was peculiarly fruit of the womb, of the womb only in fact, and not of the husband
also; and he refers the womb (body) to David, as to the chief of the race and father of the
family. Because it could not consist with a virgin’s condition to consort her with a hus-
band,3384 He therefore attributed the body (womb) to the father. That new dispensation,
then, which is found in Christ now, will prove to be what the Creator then promised under
the appellation of “the sure mercies of David,” which were Christ’s, inasmuch as Christ
sprang from David, or rather His very flesh itself was David’s “sure mercies,” consecrated
by religion, and “sure” after its resurrection. Accordingly the prophet Nathan, in the first
of Kings,3385 makes a promise to David for his seed, “which shall proceed,” says he, “out of
thy bowels.”3386 Now, if you explain this simply of Solomon, you will send me into a fit of
laughter. For David will evidently have brought forth Solomon! But is not Christ here designated
the seed of David, as of that womb which was derived from David, that is, Mary’s?
Now, because Christ rather than any other3387 was to build the temple of God, that is to
say, a holy manhood, wherein God’s Spirit might dwell as in a better temple, Christ rather
than David’s son Solomon was to be looked for as3388 the Son of God. Then, again, the
throne for ever with the kingdom for ever is more suited to Christ than to Solomon, a mere
temporal king. From Christ, too, God’s mercy did not depart, whereas on Solomon even

God’s anger alighted, after his luxury and idolatry. For Satan3389 stirred up an Edomite as
an enemy against him. Since, therefore, nothing of these things is compatible with Solomon,
but only with Christ, the method of our interpretations will certainly be true; and the very
issue of the facts shows that they were clearly predicted of Christ. And so in Him we shall
have “the sure mercies of David.” Him, not David, has God appointed for a testimony to
the nations; Him, for a prince and commander to the nations, not David, who ruled over
Israel alone. It is Christ whom all nations now invoke, which knew Him not; Christ to whom
all races now betake themselves, whom they were ignorant of before. It is impossible that
that should be said to be future, which you see (daily) coming to pass.</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—The Call of the Gentiles Under the Influence of the Gospel Foretold.</head>
<p>So you cannot get out of this notion of yours a basis for your difference between the
two Christs, as if the Jewish Christ were ordained by the Creator for the restoration of the
people alone3390 from its dispersion, whilst yours was appointed by the supremely good
God for the liberation of the whole human race. Because, after all, the earliest Christians
are found on the side of the Creator, not of Marcion,3391 all nations being called to His
kingdom, from the fact that God set up that kingdom from the tree (of the cross), when no
Cerdon was yet born, much less a Marcion. However, when you are refuted on the call of
the nations, you betake yourself to proselytes. You ask, who among the nations can turn to
the Creator, when those whom the prophet names are proselytes of individually different
and private condition?3392 “Behold,” says Isaiah, “the proselytes shall come unto me through
Thee,” showing that they were even proselytes who were to find their way to God through
Christ. But nations (Gentiles) also, like ourselves, had likewise their mention (by the
prophet) as trusting in Christ. “And in His name,” says he, “shall the Gentiles trust.” Besides,
the proselytes whom you substitute for the nations in prophecy, are not in the habit of
trusting in Christ’s name, but in the dispensation of Moses, from whom comes their instruction.
But it was in the last days that the choice3393 of the nations had its commencement.3394
In these very words Isaiah says: “And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain
of the Lord,” that is, God’s eminence, “and the house of God,” that is, Christ, the Catholic
temple of God, in which God is worshipped, “shall be established upon the mountains,”
over all the eminences of virtues and powers; “and all nations shall come unto it; and many
people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the
house of the God of Jacob; and He will teach us His way, and we will walk in it: for out of
Sion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.”3395 The gospel will
be this “way,” of the new law and the new word in Christ, no longer in Moses. “And He
shall judge among the nations,” even concerning their error. “And these shall rebuke a large
nation,” that of the Jews themselves and their proselytes. “And they shall beat their swords

into ploughshares, and their spears3396 into pruning-hooks;” in other words, they shall
change into pursuits of moderation and peace the dispositions of injurious minds, and
hostile tongues, and all kinds of evil, and blasphemy. “Nation shall not lift up sword against
nation,” shall not stir up discord. “Neither shall they learn war any more,”3397 that is, the
provocation of hostilities; so that you here learn that Christ is promised not as powerful in
war, but pursuing peace. Now you must deny either that these things were predicted, although
they are plainly seen, or that they have been accomplished, although you read of them; else,
if you cannot deny either one fact or the other, they must have been accomplished in Him
of whom they were predicted. For look at the entire course of His call up to the present time
from its beginning, how it is addressed to the nations (Gentiles) who are in these last days
approaching to God the Creator, and not to proselytes, whose election3398 was rather an
event of the earliest days. Verily the apostles have annulled3399 that belief of yours.</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—The Success of the Apostles, and Their Sufferings in the Cause of
the Gospel, Foretold.</head>
<p>You have the work of the apostles also predicted: “How beautiful are the feet of them
which preach the gospel of peace, which bring good tidings of good,”3400 not of war nor
evil tidings. In response to which is the psalm, “Their sound is gone through all the earth,
and their words to the ends of the world;”3401 that is, the words of them who carry round
about the law that proceeded from Sion and the Lord’s word from Jerusalem, in order that
that might come to pass which was written: “They who were far from my righteousness,
have come near to my righteousness and truth.”3402 When the apostles girded their loins
for this business, they renounced the elders and rulers and priests of the Jews. Well, says he,
but was it not above all things that they might preach the other god? Rather3403 (that they
might preach) that very self-same God, whose scripture they were with all their might fulfilling!
“Depart ye, depart ye,” exclaims Isaiah; “go ye out from thence, and touch not the
unclean thing,” that is blasphemy against Christ; “Go ye out of the midst of her,” even of
the synagogue. “Be ye separate who bear the vessels of the Lord.”3404 For already had the
Lord, according to the preceding words (of the prophet), revealed His Holy One with His
arm, that is to say, Christ by His mighty power, in the eyes of the nations, so that all the3405
nations and the utmost parts of the earth have seen the salvation, which was from God. By
thus departing from Judaism itself, when they exchanged the obligations and burdens of
the law for the liberty of the gospel, they were fulfilling the psalm, “Let us burst their bonds
asunder, and cast away their yoke from us;” and this indeed (they did) after that “the heathen
raged, and the people imagined vain devices;” after that “the kings of the earth set themselves,
and the rulers took their counsel together against the Lord, and against His Christ.”3406
What did the apostles thereupon suffer? You answer: Every sort of iniquitous persecutions,
from men that belonged indeed to that Creator who was the adversary of Him whom they
were preaching. Then why does the Creator, if an adversary of Christ, not only predict that
the apostles should incur this suffering, but even express His displeasure3407 thereat? For

He ought neither to predict the course of the other god, whom, as you contend, He knew
not, nor to have expressed displeasure at that which He had taken care to bring about. “See
how the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and how merciful men are taken
away, and no man considereth. For the righteous man has been removed from the evil person.”
3408 Who is this but Christ? “Come, say they, let us take away the righteous, because
He is not for our turn, (and He is clean contrary to our doings).”3409 Premising, therefore,
and likewise subjoining the fact that Christ suffered, He foretold that His just ones should
suffer equally with Him—both the apostles and all the faithful in succession; and He signed
them with that very seal of which Ezekiel spake: “The Lord said unto me, Go through the
gate, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set the mark Tau upon the foreheads of the
men.”3410 Now the Greek letter Tau and our own letter T is the very form of the cross, which
He predicted would be the sign on our foreheads in the true Catholic Jerusalem,3411 in
which, according to the twenty-first Psalm, the brethren of Christ or children of God would
ascribe glory to God the Father, in the person of Christ Himself addressing His Father; “I
will declare Thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the congregation will I sing praise
unto Thee.” For that which had to come to pass in our day in His name, and by His Spirit,
He rightly foretold would be of Him. And a little afterwards He says: “My praise shall be of
Thee in the great congregation.”3412 In the sixty-seventh Psalm He says again: “In the congregations
bless ye the Lord God.”3413 So that with this agrees also the prophecy of Malachi:
“I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord; neither will I accept your offerings: for from the
rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among the
Gentiles; and in every place sacrifice shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering”
3414—such as the ascription of glory, and blessing, and praise, and hymns. Now, inasmuch
as all these things are also found amongst you, and the sign upon the forehead,3415

<head>Chapter XXIII.—The Dispersion of the Jews, and Their Desolate Condition for Rejecting
Christ, Foretold.</head>
<p>Now, since you join the Jews in denying that their Christ has come, recollect also what
is that end which they were predicted as about to bring on themselves after the time of
Christ, for the impiety wherewith they both rejected and slew Him. For it began to come to
pass from that day, when, according to Isaiah, “a man threw away his idols of gold and of
silver, which they made into useless and hurtful objects of worship;”3416 in other words,
from the time when he threw away his idols after the truth had been made clear by Christ.
Consider whether what follows in the prophet has not received its fulfilment: “The Lord of
hosts hath taken away from Judah and from Jerusalem, amongst other things, both the
prophet and the wise artificer;”3417 that is, His Holy Spirit, who builds the church, which
is indeed the temple, and household and city of God. For thenceforth God’s grace failed
amongst them; and “the clouds were commanded to rain no rain upon the vineyard” of
Sorech; to withhold, that is, the graces of heaven, that they shed no blessing upon “the house
of Israel,” which had but produced “the thorns” wherewith it had crowned the Lord, and
“instead of righteousness, the cry” wherewith it had hurried Him away to the cross.3418 And
so in this manner the law and the prophets were until John, but the dews of divine grace
were withdrawn from the nation. After his time their madness still continued, and the name
of the Lord was blasphemed by them, as saith the Scripture: “Because of you my name is
continually blasphemed amongst the nations”3419 (for from them did the blasphemy originate);
neither in the interval from Tiberius to Vespasian did they learn repentance.3420
Therefore “has their land become desolate, their cities are burnt with fire, their country
strangers are devouring before their own eyes; the daughter of Sion has been deserted like
a cottage in a vineyard, or a lodge in a garden of cucumbers,”3421 ever since the time when
“Israel acknowledged not the Lord, and the people understood Him not, but forsook Him,
and provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger.”3422 So likewise that conditional threat of
the sword, “If ye refuse and hear me not, the sword shall devour you,”3423 has proved that
it was Christ, for rebellion against whom they have perished. In the fifty-eighth Psalm He

demands of the Father their dispersion: “Scatter them in Thy power.”3424 By Isaiah He also
says, as He finishes a prophecy of their consumption by fire:3425 “Because of me has this
happened to you; ye shall lie down in sorrow.”3426 But all this would be unmeaning enough,
if they suffered this retribution not on account of Him, who had in prophecy assigned their
suffering to His own cause, but for the sake of the Christ of the other god. Well, then, although
you affirm that it is the Christ of the other god who was driven to the cross by the
powers and authorities of the Creator, as it were by hostile beings, still I have to say, See
how manifestly He was defended3427 by the Creator: there were given to Him both “the
wicked for His burial,” even those who had strenuously maintained that His corpse had
been stolen, “and the rich for His death,”3428 even those who had redeemed Him from the
treachery of Judas, as well as from the lying report of the soldiers that His body had been
taken away. Therefore these things either did not happen to the Jews on His account, in
which case you will be refuted by the sense of the Scriptures tallying with the issue of the
facts and the order of the times, or else they did happen on His account, and then the Creator
could not have inflicted the vengeance except for His own Christ; nay, He must have
rather had a reward for Judas, if it had been his master’s enemy whom they put to death. At
all events,3429 if the Creator’s Christ has not come yet, on whose account the prophecy
dooms them to such sufferings, they will have to endure the sufferings when He shall have
come. Then where will there be a daughter of Sion to be reduced to desolation, for there is
none now to be found? Where will there be cities to be burnt with fire, for they are now in
heaps?3430 Where a nation to be dispersed, which is already in banishment? Restore to
Judæa its former state, that the Creator’s Christ may find it, and then you may contend that
another Christ has come. But then, again,3431 how is it that He can have permitted to range
through3432 His own heaven one whom He was some day to put to death on His own earth,
after the more noble and glorious region of His kingdom had been violated, and His own
very palace and sublimest height had been trodden by him? Or was it only in appearance
rather that he did this?3433 God is no doubt3434 a jealous God! Yet he gained the victory.

<head>Chapter XXIV.—Christ’s Millennial and Heavenly Glory in Company with His
Saints.</head>
<p>Yes, certainly,3435 you say, I do hope from Him that which amounts in itself to a proof
of the diversity (of Christs), God’s kingdom in an everlasting and heavenly possession. Besides,
your Christ promises to the Jews their primitive condition, with the recovery of their
country; and after this life’s course is over, repose in Hades3436 in Abraham’s bosom. Oh,
most excellent God, when He restores in amnesty3437 what He took away in wrath! Oh,
what a God is yours, who both wounds and heals, creates evil and makes peace! Oh, what
a God, that is merciful even down to Hades! I shall have something to say about Abraham’s
bosom in the proper place.3438 As for the restoration of Judæa, however, which even the
Jews themselves, induced by the names of places and countries, hope for just as it is described,
3439 it would be tedious to state at length3440 how the figurative3441 interpretation
is spiritually applicable to Christ and His church, and to the character and fruits thereof;
besides, the subject has been regularly treated3442 in another work, which we entitle De Spe
Fidelium.3443 At present, too, it would be superfluous3444 for this reason, that our inquiry
relates to what is promised in heaven, not on earth. But we do confess that a kingdom is
promised to us upon the earth, although before heaven, only in another state of existence;
inasmuch as it will be after the resurrection for a thousand years in the divinely-built city
of Jerusalem,3445 “let down from heaven,”3446 which the apostle also calls “our mother from
above;”3447 and, while declaring that our πολίτευμα , or citizenship, is in heaven,3448 he

predicates of it3449 that it is really a city in heaven. This both Ezekiel had knowledge of3450
and the Apostle John beheld.3451 And the word of the new prophecy which is a part of our
belief,3452 attests how it foretold that there would be for a sign a picture of this very city
exhibited to view previous to its manifestation. This prophecy, indeed, has been very lately
fulfilled in an expedition to the East.3453 For it is evident from the testimony of even heathen
witnesses, that in Judæa there was suspended in the sky a city early every morning for forty
days. As the day advanced, the entire figure of its walls would wane gradually,3454 and
sometimes it would vanish instantly.3455 We say that this city has been provided by God
for receiving the saints on their resurrection, and refreshing them with the abundance of
all really spiritual blessings, as a recompense for those which in the world we have either
despised or lost; since it is both just and God-worthy that His servants should have their
joy in the place where they have also suffered affliction for His name’s sake. Of the heavenly
kingdom this is the process.3456 After its thousand years are over, within which period is
completed the resurrection of the saints, who rise sooner or later according to their deserts
there will ensue the destruction of the world and the conflagration of all things at the judgment:
we shall then be changed in a moment into the substance of angels, even by the investiture
of an incorruptible nature, and so be removed to that kingdom in heaven of which we
have now been treating, just as if it had not been predicted by the Creator, and as if it were
proving Christ to belong to the other god and as if he were the first and sole revealer of it.
But now learn that it has been, in fact, predicted by the Creator, and that even without prediction
it has a claim upon our faith in respect of3457 the Creator. What appears to be
probable to you, when Abraham’s seed, after the primal promise of being like the sand of
the sea for multitude, is destined likewise to an equality with the stars of heaven—are not
these the indications both of an earthly and a heavenly dispensation?3458 When Isaac, in
blessing his son Jacob, says, “God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the
earth,”3459 are there not in his words examples of both kinds of blessing? Indeed, the very

form of the blessing is in this instance worthy of notice. For in relation to Jacob, who is the
type of the later and more excellent people, that is to say ourselves,3460 first comes the
promise of the heavenly dew, and afterwards that about the fatness of the earth. So are we
first invited to heavenly blessings when we are separated from the world, and afterwards
we thus find ourselves in the way of obtaining also earthly blessings. And your own gospel
likewise has it in this wise: “Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and these things shall be added
unto you.”3461 But to Esau the blessing promised is an earthly one, which he supplements
with a heavenly, after the fatness of the earth, saying, “Thy dwelling shall be also of the dew
of heaven.”3462 For the dispensation of the Jews (who were in Esau, the prior of the sons in
birth, but the later in affection3463) at first was imbued with earthly blessings through the
law, and afterwards brought round to heavenly ones through the gospel by faith. When
Jacob sees in his dream the steps of a ladder set upon the earth, and reaching to heaven,
with angels ascending and descending thereon, and the Lord standing above, we shall without
hesitation venture to suppose,3464 that by this ladder the Lord has in judgment appointed
that the way to heaven is shown to men, whereby some may attain to it, and others fall
therefrom. For why, as soon as he awoke out of his sleep, and shook through a dread of the
spot, does he fall to an interpretation of his dream? He exclaims, “How terrible is this place!”
And then adds, “This is none other than the house of God; this is the gate of heaven!”3465
For he had seen Christ the Lord, the temple of God, and also the gate by whom heaven is
entered. Now surely he would not have mentioned the gate of heaven, if heaven is not entered
in the dispensation of the3466 Creator. But there is now a gate provided by Christ, which
admits and conducts to glory. Of this Amos says: “He buildeth His ascensions into heaven;”
3467 certainly not for Himself alone, but for His people also, who will be with Him. “And
Thou shalt bind them about Thee,” says he, “like the adornment of a bride.”3468 Accordingly
the Spirit, admiring such as soar up to the celestial realms by these ascensions, says, “They

fly, as if they were kites; they fly as clouds, and as young doves, unto me”3469—that is, simply
like a dove.3470 For we shall, according to the apostle, be caught up into the clouds to meet
the Lord (even the Son of man, who shall come in the clouds, according to Daniel3471) and
so shall we ever be with the Lord,3472 so long as He remains both on the earth and in heaven,
who, against such as are thankless for both one promise and the other, calls the elements
themselves to witness: “Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth.”3473 Now, for my own part
indeed, even though Scripture held out no hand of heavenly hope to me (as, in fact, it so
often does), I should still possess a sufficient presumption3474 of even this promise, in my
present enjoyment of the earthly gift; and I should look out for something also of the heavenly,
from Him who is the God of heaven as well as of earth. I should thus believe that the
Christ who promises the higher blessings is (the Son) of Him who had also promised the
lower ones; who had, moreover, afforded proofs of greater gifts by smaller ones; who had
reserved for His Christ alone this revelation3475 of a (perhaps3476) unheard of kingdom, so
that, while the earthly glory was announced by His servants, the heavenly might have God
Himself for its messenger. You, however, argue for another Christ, from the very circumstance
that He proclaims a new kingdom. You ought first to bring forward some example of His
beneficence,3477 that I may have no good reason for doubting the credibility of the great
promise, which you say ought to be hoped for; nay, it is before all things necessary that you
should prove that a heaven belongs to Him, whom you declare to be a promiser of heavenly
things. As it is, you invite us to dinner, but do not point out your house; you assert a kingdom,
but show us no royal state.3478 Can it be that your Christ promises a kingdom of heaven,
without having a heaven; as He displayed Himself man, without having flesh? O what a

<p>In Which Tertullian Pursues His Argument. Jesus is the Christ of the
Creator. He Derives His Proofs from St. Luke’s Gospel; That Being
the Only Historical Portion of the New Testament Partially Accepted
by Marcion. This Book May Also Be Regarded as a Commentary
on St. Luke. It Gives Remarkable Proof of Tertullian’s Grasp of
Scripture, and Proves that “The Old Testament is Not Contrary to
the New.” It Also Abounds in Striking Expositions of Scriptural
Passages, Embracing Profound Views of Revelation, in Connection
with the Nature of Man.</p>

Old and the New Testaments. These Variations Quite Compatible with One and

<p>Every opinion and the whole scheme3481 of the impious and sacrilegious Marcion we
now bring to the test3482 of that very Gospel which, by his process of interpolation, he has
made his own. To encourage a belief of this Gospel he has actually3483 devised for it a sort
of dower,3484 in a work composed of contrary statements set in opposition, thence entitled
Antitheses, and compiled with a view to such a severance of the law from the gospel as should
divide the Deity into two, nay, diverse, gods—one for each Instrument, or Testament3485
as it is more usual to call it; that by such means he might also patronize3486 belief in “the
Gospel according to the Antitheses.” These, however, I would have attacked in special

combat, hand to hand; that is to say, I would have encountered singly the several devices of
the Pontic heretic, if it were not much more convenient to refute them in and with that very
gospel to which they contribute their support. Although it is so easy to meet them at once
with a peremptory demurrer,3487 yet, in order that I may both make them admissible in
argument, and account them valid expressions of opinion, and even contend that they make
for our side, that so there may be all the redder shame for the blindness of their author, we
have now drawn out some antitheses of our own in opposition to Marcion. And indeed3488
I do allow that one order did run its course in the old dispensation under the Creator,3489
and that another is on its way in the new under Christ. I do not deny that there is a difference
in the language of their documents, in their precepts of virtue, and in their teachings of the
law; but yet all this diversity is consistent with one and the same God, even Him by whom
it was arranged and also foretold. Long ago3490 did Isaiah declare that “out of Sion should
go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem”3491—some other law, that is,
and another word. In short, says he, “He shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke
many people;”3492 meaning not those of the Jewish people only, but of the nations which
are judged by the new law of the gospel and the new word of the apostles, and are amongst
themselves rebuked of their old error as soon as they have believed. And as the result of this,
“they beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears (which are a kind of hunting
instruments) into pruning-hooks;”3493 that is to say, minds, which once were fierce and
cruel, are changed by them into good dispositions productive of good fruit. And again:
“Hearken unto me, hearken unto me, my people, and ye kings, give ear unto me; for a law
shall proceed from me, and my judgment for a light to the nations;”3494 wherefore He had
determined and decreed that the nations also were to be enlightened by the law and the
word of the gospel. This will be that law which (according to David also) is unblameable,
because “perfect, converting the soul”3495 from idols unto God. This likewise will be the
word concerning which the same Isaiah says, “For the Lord will make a decisive word in

his own ground.</note>

the land.”3496 Because the New Testament is compendiously short,3497 and freed from the
minute and perplexing3498 burdens of the law. But why enlarge, when the Creator by the
same prophet foretells the renovation more manifestly and clearly than the light itself?
“Remember not the former things, neither consider the things of old” (the old things have
passed away, and new things are arising). “Behold, I will do new things, which shall now
spring forth.”3499 So by Jeremiah: “Break up for yourselves new pastures,3500 and sow not
among thorns, and circumcise yourselves in the foreskin of your heart.”3501 And in another
passage: “Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the
house of Jacob, and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with
their fathers in the day when I arrested their dispensation, in order to bring them out of the
land of Egypt.”3502 He thus shows that the ancient covenant is temporary only, when He
indicates its change; also when He promises that it shall be followed by an eternal one. For
by Isaiah He says: “Hear me, and ye shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with
you,” adding “the sure mercies of David,”3503 in order that He might show that that covenant
was to run its course in Christ. That He was of the family of David, according to the genealogy
of Mary,3504 He declared in a figurative way even by the rod which was to proceed out of
the stem of Jesse.3505 Forasmuch then as he said, that from the Creator there would come
other laws, and other words, and new dispensations of covenants, indicating also that the
very sacrifices were to receive higher offices, and that amongst all nations, by Malachi when
he says: “I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord, neither will I accept your sacrifices at
your hands. For from the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, my name
shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place a sacrifice is offered unto my name,
even a pure offering”3506—meaning simple prayer from a pure conscience,—it is of necessity

that every change which comes as the result of innovation, introduces a diversity in those
things of which the change is made, from which diversity arises also a contrariety. For as
there is nothing, after it has undergone a change, which does not become different, so there
is nothing different which is not contrary.3507 Of that very thing, therefore, there will be
predicated a contrariety in consequence of its diversity, to which there accrued a change of
condition after an innovation. He who brought about the change, the same instituted the
diversity also; He who foretold the innovation, the same announced beforehand the contrariety
likewise. Why, in your interpretation, do you impute a difference in the state of
things to a difference of powers? Why do you wrest to the Creator’s prejudice those examples
from which you draw your antitheses, when you may recognise them all in His sensations
and affections? “I will wound,” He says, “and I will heal;” “I will kill,” He says again, “and I
will make alive”3508—even the same “who createth evil and maketh peace;”3509 from which
you are used even to censure Him with the imputation of fickleness and inconstancy, as if
He forbade what He commanded, and commanded what He forbade. Why, then, have you
not reckoned up the Antitheses also which occur in the natural works of the Creator, who
is for ever contrary to Himself? You have not been able, unless I am misinformed, to recognise
the fact,3510 that the world, at all events,3511 even amongst your people of Pontus, is made
up of a diversity of elements which are hostile to one another.3512 It was therefore your
bounden duty first to have determined that the god of the light was one being, and the god
of darkness was another, in such wise that you might have been able to have distinctly asserted
one of them to be the god of the law and the other the god of the gospel. It is, however, the
settled conviction already3513 of my mind from manifest proofs, that, as His works and
plans3514 exist in the way of Antitheses, so also by the same rule exist the mysteries of His
religion.3515</p>

by Him. The Other Gospels Equally Authoritative. Marcion’s Terms of Discussion,
However, Accepted, and Grappled with on the Footing of St. Luke’s Gospel
Alone.</head>
<p>You have now our answer to the Antitheses compendiously indicated by us.3516 I pass
on to give a proof of the Gospel3517—not, to be sure, of Jewry, but of Pontus—having become
meanwhile3518 adulterated; and this shall indicate3519 the order by which we proceed. We
lay it down as our first position, that the evangelical Testament3520 has apostles for its authors,
3521 to whom was assigned by the Lord Himself this office of publishing the gospel.
Since, however, there are apostolic3522 men also,3523 they are yet not alone, but appear with
apostles and after apostles; because the preaching of disciples might be open to the suspicion
of an affectation of glory, if there did not accompany it3524 the authority of the masters,
which means that of Christ,3525 for it was that which made the apostles their masters. Of
the apostles, therefore, John and Matthew first instil3526 faith into us; whilst of apostolic
men, Luke and Mark renew it afterwards.3527 These all start with the same principles of the
faith,3528 so far as relates to the one only God the Creator and His Christ, how that He was
born of the Virgin, and came to fulfil3529 the law and the prophets. Never mind3530 if there

does occur some variation in the order of their narratives, provided that there be agreement
in the essential matter3531 of the faith, in which there is disagreement with Marcion. Marcion,
on the other hand, you must know,3532 ascribes no author to his Gospel, as if it could not
be allowed him to affix a title to that from which it was no crime (in his eyes) to subvert3533
the very body. And here I might now make a stand, and contend that a work ought not to
be recognised, which holds not its head erect, which exhibits no consistency, which gives
no promise of credibility from the fulness of its title and the just profession of its author.
But we prefer to join issue3534 on every point; nor shall we leave unnoticed3535 what may
fairly be understood to be on our side.3536 Now, of the authors whom we possess, Marcion
seems to have singled out Luke3537 for his mutilating process.3538 Luke, however, was not
an apostle, but only an apostolic man; not a master, but a disciple, and so inferior to a master—
at least as far subsequent to3539 him as the apostle whom he followed (and that, no
doubt, was Paul3540) was subsequent to the others; so that, had Marcion even published his
Gospel in the name of St. Paul himself, the single authority of the document,3541 destitute
of all support from preceding authorities, would not be a sufficient basis for our faith. There
would be still wanted that Gospel which St. Paul found in existence, to which he yielded his
belief, and with which he so earnestly wished his own to agree, that he actually on that account
went up to Jerusalem to know and consult the apostles, “lest he should run, or had been
running in vain;”3542 in other words, that the faith which he had learned, and the gospel
which he was preaching, might be in accordance with theirs. Then, at last, having conferred
with the (primitive) authors, and having agreed with them touching the rule of faith, they
joined their hands in fellowship, and divided their labours thenceforth in the office of
preaching the gospel, so that they were to go to the Jews, and St. Paul to the Jews and the

<head>Chapter III.3544—Marcion Insinuated the Untrustworthiness of Certain Apostles
Whom St. Paul Rebuked. The Rebuke Shows that It Cannot Be Regarded as
Derogating from Their Authority. The Apostolic Gospels Perfectly Authentic.</head>
<p>In the scheme of Marcion, on the contrary,3545 the mystery3546 of the Christian religion
begins from the discipleship of Luke. Since, however, it was on its course previous to that
point, it must have had3547 its own authentic materials,3548 by means of which it found its
own way down to St. Luke; and by the assistance of the testimony which it bore, Luke himself
becomes admissible. Well, but3549 Marcion, finding the Epistle of Paul to the Galatians
(wherein he rebukes even apostles3550 for “not walking uprightly according to the truth of
the gospel,”3551 as well as accuses certain false apostles of perverting the gospel of Christ),
labours very hard to destroy the character3552 of those Gospels which are published as
genuine3553 and under the name of apostles, in order, forsooth, to secure for his own Gospel
the credit which he takes away from them. But then, even if he censures Peter and John and
James, who were thought to be pillars, it is for a manifest reason. They seemed to be changing
their company3554 from respect of persons. And yet as Paul himself “became all things to
all men,”3555 that he might gain all, it was possible that Peter also might have betaken himself
to the same plan of practising somewhat different from what he taught. And, in like manner,
if false apostles also crept in, their character too showed itself in their insisting upon circumcision
and the Jewish ceremonies. So that it was not on account of their preaching, but of
their conversation, that they were marked by St. Paul, who would with equal impartiality
have marked them with censure, if they had erred at all with respect to God the Creator or
His Christ. Each several case will therefore have to be distinguished. When Marcion com-

depraved the gospel, he thereby accuses Christ, by accusing those whom Christ chose. If,
then, the apostles, who are censured simply for inconsistency of walk, composed the Gospel
in a pure form,3556 but false apostles interpolated their true record; and if our own copies
have been made from these,3557 where will that genuine text3558 of the apostle’s writings
be found which has not suffered adulteration? Which was it that enlightened Paul, and
through him Luke? It is either completely blotted out, as if by some deluge—being obliterated
by the inundation of falsifiers—in which case even Marcion does not possess the true Gospel;
or else, is that very edition which Marcion alone possesses the true one, that is, of the apostles?
How, then, does that agree with ours, which is said not to be (the work) of apostles, but of
Luke? Or else, again, if that which Marcion uses is not to be attributed to Luke simply because
it does agree with ours (which, of course,3559 is, also adulterated in its title), then it is the
work of apostles. Our Gospel, therefore, which is in agreement with it, is equally the work
of apostles, but also adulterated in its title.3560</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Each Side Claims to Possess the True Gospel. Antiquity the Criterion
of Truth in Such a Matter. Marcion’s Pretensions as an Amender of the Gospel.</head>
<p>We must follow, then, the clue3561 of our discussion, meeting every effort of our oppon-
ents with reciprocal vigor. I say that my Gospel is the true one; Marcion, that his is. I affirm
that Marcion’s Gospel is adulterated; Marcion, that mine is. Now what is to settle the point
for us, except it be that principle3562 of time, which rules that the authority lies with that
which shall be found to be more ancient; and assumes as an elemental truth,3563 that corruption
(of doctrine) belongs to the side which shall be convicted of comparative lateness
in its origin.3564 For, inasmuch as error3565 is falsification of truth, it must needs be that
truth therefore precede error. A thing must exist prior to its suffering any casualty;3566 and
an object3567 must precede all rivalry to itself. Else how absurd it would be, that, when we
have proved our position to be the older one, and Marcion’s the later, ours should yet appear
to be the false one, before it had even received from truth its objective existence;3568 and
Marcion’s should also be supposed to have experienced rivalry at our hands, even before
its publication; and, in fine, that that should be thought to be the truer position which is the
later one—a century3569 later than the publication of all the many and great facts and records
of the Christian religion, which certainly could not have been published without, that is to
say, before, the truth of the gospel. With regard, then, to the pending3570 question, of Luke’s
Gospel (so far as its being the common property3571 of ourselves and Marcion enables it to
be decisive of the truth,3572) that portion of it which we alone receive3573 is so much older
than Marcion, that Marcion himself once believed it, when in the first warmth of faith he
contributed money to the Catholic church, which along with himself was afterwards rejec-

ted,3574 when he fell away from our truth into his own heresy. What if the Marcionites have
denied that he held the primitive faith amongst ourselves, in the face even of his own letter?
What, if they do not acknowledge the letter? They, at any rate, receive his Antitheses; and
more than that, they make ostentatious use3575 of them. Proof out of these is enough for
me. For if the Gospel, said to be Luke’s which is current amongst us3576 (we shall see
whether it be also current with Marcion), is the very one which, as Marcion argues in his
Antitheses, was interpolated by the defenders of Judaism, for the purpose of such a conglomeration
with it of the law and the prophets as should enable them out of it to fashion their
Christ, surely he could not have so argued about it, unless he had found it (in such a form).
No one censures things before they exist,3577 when he knows not whether they will come
to pass. Emendation never precedes the fault. To be sure,3578 an amender of that Gospel,
which had been all topsy-turvy3579 from the days of Tiberius to those of Antoninus, first
presented himself in Marcion alone—so long looked for by Christ, who was all along regretting
that he had been in so great a hurry to send out his apostles without the support of
Marcion! But for all that,3580 heresy, which is for ever mending the Gospels, and corrupting
them in the act, is an affair of man’s audacity, not of God’s authority; and if Marcion be
even a disciple, he is yet not “above his master;”3581 if Marcion be an apostle, still as Paul
says, “Whether it be I or they, so we preach;”3582 if Marcion be a prophet, even “the spirits
of the prophets will be subject to the prophets,”3583 for they are not the authors of confusion,
but of peace; or if Marcion be actually an angel, he must rather be designated “as anathema
than as a preacher of the gospel,”3584 because it is a strange gospel which he has preached.
So that, whilst he amends, he only confirms both positions: both that our Gospel is the prior
one, for he amends that which he has previously fallen in with; and that that is the later one,
which, by putting it together out of the emendations of ours, he has made his own Gospel,
and a novel one too.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—By the Rule of Antiquity, the Catholic Gospels are Found to Be True,
Including the Real St. Luke’s. Marcion’s Only a Mutilated Edition. The Heretic’s
Weakness and Inconsistency in Ignoring the Other Gospels.3585</head>
<p>On the whole, then, if that is evidently more true which is earlier, if that is earlier which
is from the very beginning, if that is from the beginning which has the apostles for its authors,
then it will certainly be quite as evident, that that comes down from the apostles, which has
been kept as a sacred deposit3586 in the churches of the apostles. Let us see what milk the
Corinthians drank from Paul; to what rule of faith the Galatians were brought for correction;
what the Philippians, the Thessalonians, the Ephesians read by it; what utterance also the
Romans give, so very near3587 (to the apostles), to whom Peter and Paul conjointly3588 bequeathed
the gospel even sealed with their own blood. We have also St. John’s foster
churches.3589 For although Marcion rejects his Apocalypse, the order3590 of the bishops
(thereof), when traced up to their origin, will yet rest on John as their author. In the same
manner is recognised the excellent source3591 of the other churches. I say, therefore, that
in them (and not simply such of them as were founded by apostles, but in all those which
are united with them in the fellowship of the mystery of the gospel of Christ3592) that Gospel
of Luke which we are defending with all our might has stood its ground from its very first
publication; whereas Marcion’s Gospel is not known to most people, and to none whatever
is it known without being at the same time3593 condemned. It too, of course,3594 has its
churches, but specially its own—as late as they are spurious; and should you want to know
their original,3595 you will more easily discover apostasy in it than apostolicity, with Marcion
forsooth as their founder, or some one of Marcion’s swarm.3596 Even wasps make combs;3597
so also these Marcionites make churches. The same authority of the apostolic churches will

afford evidence3598 to the other Gospels also, which we possess equally through their
means,3599 and according to their usage—I mean the Gospels of John and Matthew—whilst
that which Mark published may be affirmed to be Peter’s3600 whose interpreter Mark was.
For even Luke’s form3601 of the Gospel men usually ascribe to Paul.3602 And it may well
seem3603 that the works which disciples publish belong to their masters. Well, then, Marcion
ought to be called to a strict account3604 concerning these (other Gospels) also, for having
omitted them, and insisted in preference3605 on Luke; as if they, too, had not had free course
in the churches, as well as Luke’s Gospel, from the beginning. Nay, it is even more credible
that they3606 existed from the very beginning; for, being the work of apostles, they were
prior, and coeval in origin with3607 the churches themselves. But how comes it to pass, if
the apostles published nothing, that their disciples were more forward in such a work; for
they could not have been disciples, without any instruction from their masters? If, then, it
be evident that these (Gospels) also were current in the churches, why did not Marcion
touch them—either to amend them if they were adulterated, or to acknowledge them if they
were uncorrupt? For it is but natural3608 that they who were perverting the gospel, should
be more solicitous about the perversion of those things whose authority they knew to be
more generally received. Even the false apostles (were so called) on this very account, because
they imitated the apostles by means of their falsification. In as far, then, as he might have
amended what there was to amend, if found corrupt, in so far did he firmly imply3609 that
all was free from corruption which he did not think required amendment. In short,3610 he
simply amended what he thought was corrupt; though, indeed, not even this justly, because
it was not really corrupt. For if the (Gospels) of the apostles3611 have come down to us in

their integrity, whilst Luke’s, which is received amongst us,3612 so far accords with their
rule as to be on a par with them in permanency of reception in the churches, it clearly follows
that Luke’s Gospel also has come down to us in like integrity until the sacrilegious treatment
of Marcion. In short, when Marcion laid hands on it, it then became diverse and hostile to
the Gospels of the apostles. I will therefore advise his followers, that they either change these
Gospels, however late to do so, into a conformity with their own, whereby they may seem
to be in agreement with the apostolic writings (for they are daily retouching their work, as
daily they are convicted by us); or else that they blush for their master, who stands selfcondemned3613
either way—when once3614 he hands on the truth of the gospel conscience
smitten, or again3615 subverts it by shameless tampering. Such are the summary arguments
which we use, when we take up arms3616 against heretics for the faith3617 of the gospel,
maintaining both that order of periods, which rules that a late date is the mark of forgers,3618
and that authority of churches3619 which lends support to the tradition of the apostles; because
truth must needs precede the forgery, and proceed straight from those by whom it
has been handed on.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—Marcion’s Object in Adulterating the Gospel. No Difference Between
the Christ of the Creator and the Christ of the Gospel. No Rival Christ Admissible.
The Connection of the True Christ with the Dispensation of the Old Testament
Asserted.</head>
<p>But we now advance a step further on, and challenge (as we promised to do) the very
Gospel of Marcion, with the intention of thus proving that it has been adulterated. For it is
certain3620 that the whole aim at which he has strenuously laboured even in the drawing
up of his Antitheses, centres in this, that he may establish a diversity between the Old and
the New Testaments, so that his own Christ may be separate from the Creator, as belonging
to this rival god, and as alien from the law and the prophets. It is certain, also, that with this
view3621 he has erased everything that was contrary to his own opinion and made for the
Creator, as if it had been interpolated by His advocates, whilst everything which agreed with
his own opinion he has retained. The latter statements we shall strictly examine;3622 and if
they shall turn out rather for our side, and shatter the assumption of Marcion, we shall
embrace them. It will then become evident, that in retaining them he has shown no less of
the defect of blindness, which characterizes heresy, than he displayed when he erased all
the former class of subjects. Such, then, is to be3623 the drift and form of my little treatise;
subject, of course, to whatever condition may have become requisite on both sides of the
question.3624 Marcion has laid down the position, that Christ who in the days of Tiberius
was, by a previously unknown god, revealed for the salvation of all nations, is a different
being from Him who was ordained by God the Creator for the restoration of the Jewish
state, and who is yet to come. Between these he interposes the separation of3625 a great and
absolute difference—as great as lies between what is just and what is good;3626 as great as
lies between the law and the gospel; as great, (in short,) as is the difference between Judaism
and Christianity. Hence will arise also our rule,3627 by which we determine3628 that there
ought to be nothing in common between the Christ of the rival god and the Creator; but

<head>Chapter VII.—Marcion Rejected the Preceding Portion of St. Luke’s Gospel.
Therefore This Review Opens with an Examination of the Case of the Evil Spirit
in the Synagogue of Capernaum. He Whom the Demon Acknowledged Was the
Creator’s Christ.</head>
<p>In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius3634 (for such is Marcion’s proposition) he
“came down to the Galilean city of Capernaum,” of course meaning3635 from the heaven
of the Creator, to which he had previously descended from his own. What then had been
his course,3636 for him to be described as first descending from his own heaven to the Creator’s?
For why should I abstain from censuring those parts of the statement which do not
satisfy the requirement of an ordinary narrative, but always end in a falsehood? To be sure,
our censure has been once for all expressed in the question, which we have already3637
suggested: Whether, when descending through the Creator’s domain, and indeed in hostility
to him, he could possibly have been admitted by him, and by him been transmitted to the
earth, which was equally his territory? Now, however, I want also to know the remainder
of his course down, assuming that he came down. For we must not be too nice in inquiring3638
whether it is supposed that he was seen in any place. To come into view3639 indicates3640
a sudden unexpected glance, which for a moment fixed3641 the eye upon the object
that passed before the view, without staying. But when it happens that a descent has been
effected, it is apparent, and comes under the notice of the eyes.3642 Moreover, it takes account
of fact, and thus obliges one to examine in what condition with what preparation,3643 with
how much violence or moderation, and further, at what time of the day or night, the descent
was made; who, again, saw the descent, who reported it, who seriously avouched the fact,
which certainly was not easy to be believed, even after the asseveration. It is, in short, too

bad3644 that Romulus should have had in Proculus an avoucher of his ascent to heaven,
when the Christ of (this) god could not find any one to announce his descent from heaven;
just as if the ascent of the one and the descent of the other were not effected on one and the
same ladder of falsehood! Then, what had he to do with Galilee, if he did not belong to the
Creator by whom3645 that region was destined (for His Christ) when about to enter on His
ministry?3646 As Isaiah says: “Drink in this first, and be prompt, O region of Zabulon and
land of Nephthalim, and ye others who (inhabit) the sea-coast, and that of Jordan, Galilee
of the nations, ye people who sit in darkness, behold a great light; upon you, who inhabit
(that) land, sitting in the shadow of death, the light hath arisen.”3647 It is, however, well that
Marcion’s god does claim to be the enlightener of the nations, that so he might have the
better reason for coming down from heaven; only, if it must needs be,3648 he should rather
have made Pontus his place of descent than Galilee. But since both the place and the work
of illumination according to the prophecy are compatible with Christ, we begin to discern3649
that He is the subject of the prophecy, which shows that at the very outset of His ministry,
He came not to destroy the law and the prophets, but rather to fulfil them;3650 for Marcion
has erased the passage as an interpolation.3651 It will, however, be vain for him to deny that
Christ uttered in word what He forthwith did partially indeed. For the prophecy about place
He at once fulfilled. From heaven straight to the synagogue. As the adage runs: “The business
on which we are come, do at once.” Marcion must even expunge from the Gospel, “I am
not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel;”3652 and, “It is not meet to take the
children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs,”3653—in order, forsooth, that Christ may not appear
to be an Israelite. But facts will satisfy me instead of words. Withdraw all the sayings of my

Christ, His acts shall speak. Lo, He enters the synagogue; surely (this is going) to the lost
sheep of the house of Israel. Behold, it is to Israelites first that He offers the “bread” of His
doctrine; surely it is because they are “children” that He shows them this priority.3654 Observe,
He does not yet impart it to others; surely He passes them by as “dogs.” For to whom
else could He better have imparted it, than to such as were strangers to the Creator, if He
especially belonged not to the Creator? And yet how could He have been admitted into the
synagogue—one so abruptly appearing,3655 so unknown; one, of whom no one had as yet
been apprised of His tribe, His nation, His family, and lastly, His enrolment in the census
of Augustus—that most faithful witness of the Lord’s nativity, kept in the archives of Rome?
They certainly would have remembered, if they did not know Him to be circumcised, that
He must not be admitted into their most holy places. And even if He had the general right
of entering3656 the synagogue (like other Jews), yet the function of giving instruction was
allowed only to a man who was extremely well known, and examined and tried, and for
some time invested with the privilege after experience duly attested elsewhere. But “they
were all astonished at His doctrine.” Of course they were; “for, says (St. Luke), “His word
was with power3657—not because He taught in opposition to the law and the prophets. No
doubt, His divine discourse3658 gave forth both power and grace, building up rather than
pulling down the substance of the law and the prophets. Otherwise, instead of “astonishment,
they would feel horror. It would not be admiration, but aversion, prompt and sure, which
they would bestow on one who was the destroyer of law and prophets, and the especial
propounder as a natural consequence of a rival god; for he would have been unable to teach
anything to the disparagement of the law and the prophets, and so far of the Creator also,
without premising the doctrine of a different and rival divinity. Inasmuch, then, as the
Scripture makes no other statement on the matter than that the simple force and power of
His word produced astonishment, it more naturally3659 shows that His teaching was in accordance
with the Creator by not denying (that it was so), than that it was in opposition to
the Creator, by not asserting (such a fact). And thus He will either have to be acknowledged
as belonging to Him,3660 in accordance with whom He taught; or else will have to be adjudged
a deceiver since He taught in accordance with One whom He had come to oppose. In the
same passage, “the spirit of an unclean devil” exclaims: “What have we to do with Thee,

Thou Jesus? Art Thou come to destroy us? I know Thee who Thou art, the Holy One of
God.”3661 I do not here raise the question whether this appellation was suitable to one who
ought not to be called Christ, unless he were sent by the Creator.3662 Elsewhere3663 there
has been already given a full consideration of His titles.</p>
<p>My present discussion is, how the evil spirit could have known that He was called by
such a name, when there had never at any time been uttered about Him a single prophecy
by a god who was unknown, and up to that time silent, of whom it was not possible for Him
to be attested as “the Holy One,” as (of a god) unknown even to his own Creator. What
similar event could he then have published3664 of a new deity, whereby he might betoken
for “the holy one” of the rival god? Simply that he went into the synagogue, and did nothing
even in word against the Creator? As therefore he could not by any means acknowledge
him, whom he was ignorant of, to be Jesus and the Holy One of God; so did he acknowledge
Him whom he knew (to be both). For he remembered how that the prophet had prophesied3665
of “the Holy One” of God, and how that God’s name of “Jesus” was in the son of
Nun.3666 These facts he had also received3667 from the angel, according to our Gospel:
“Wherefore that which shall be born of thee shall be called the Holy One, the Son of God;”3668
and, “Thou shalt call his name Jesus.”3669 Thus he actually had (although only an evil spirit)
some idea of the Lord’s dispensation, rather than of any strange and heretofore imperfectly
understood one. Because he also premised this question: “What have we to do with
Thee?”—not as if referring to a strange Jesus, to whom pertain the evil spirits of the Creator.
Nor did he say, What hast Thou to do with us? but, “What have we to do with Thee?” as if
deploring himself, and deprecating his own calamity; at the prospect of which he adds: “Art
Thou come to destroy us?” So completely did he acknowledge in Jesus the Son of that God
who was judicial and avenging, and (so to speak) severe,3670 and not of him who was simply
good,3671 and knew not how to destroy or how to punish! Now for what purpose have we

adduced his passage first?3672 In order to show that Jesus was neither acknowledged by the
evil spirit, nor affirmed by Himself, to be any other than the Creator’s. Well, but Jesus rebuked
him, you say. To be sure he did, as being an envious (spirit), and in his very confession only
petulant, and evil in adulation—just as if it had been Christ’s highest glory to have come for
the destruction of demons, and not for the salvation of mankind; whereas His wish really
was that His disciples should not glory in the subjection of evil spirits but in the fair beauty
of salvation.3673 Why else3674 did He rebuke him? If it was because he was entirely wrong
(in his invocation), then He was neither Jesus nor the Holy One of God; if it was because
he was partially wrong—for having supposed him to be, rightly enough,3675 Jesus and the
Holy One of God, but also as belonging to the Creator—most unjustly would He have rebuked
him for thinking what he knew he ought to think (about Him), and for not supposing that
of Him which he knew not that he ought to suppose—that he was another Jesus, and the
holy one of the other god. If, however, the rebuke has not a more probable meaning3676
than that which we ascribe to it, it follows that the evil spirit made no mistake, and was not
rebuked for lying; for it was Jesus Himself, besides whom it was impossible for the evil
spirit to have acknowledged any other, whilst Jesus affirmed that He was He whom the evil
spirit had acknowledged, by not rebuking him for uttering a lie.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Other Proofs from the Same Chapter, that Jesus, Who Preached at
Nazareth, and Was Acknowledged by Certain Demons as Christ the Son of God,
Was the Creator’s Christ. As Occasion Offers, the Docetic Errors of Marcion are
Exposed.</head>
<p>The Christ of the Creator had3677 to be called a Nazarene according to prophecy; whence
the Jews also designate us, on that very account,3678 Nazerenes3679 after Him. For we are
they of whom it is written, “Her Nazarites were whiter than snow;”3680 even they who were
once defiled with the stains of sin, and darkened with the clouds of ignorance. But to Christ
the title Nazarene was destined to become a suitable one, from the hiding-place of His infancy,
for which He went down and dwelt at Nazareth,3681 to escape from Archelaus the son of
Herod. This fact I have not refrained from mentioning on this account, because it behoved
Marcion’s Christ to have forborne all connection whatever with the domestic localities of
the Creator’s Christ, when he had so many towns in Judæa which had not been by the
prophets thus assigned3682 to the Creator’s Christ. But Christ will be (the Christ) of the
prophets, wheresoever He is found in accordance with the prophets. And yet even at Nazareth
He is not remarked as having preached anything new,3683 whilst in another verse He is said
to have been rejected3684 by reason of a simple proverb.3685 Here at once, when I observe
that they laid their hands on Him, I cannot help drawing a conclusion respecting His bodily
substance, which cannot be believed to have been a phantom,3686 since it was capable of
being touched and even violently handled, when He was seized and taken and led to the
very brink of a precipice. For although He escaped through the midst of them, He had
already experienced their rough treatment, and afterwards went His way, no doubt3687 because
the crowd (as usually happens) gave way, or was even broken through; but not because
it was eluded as by an impalpable disguise,3688 which, if there had been such, would not at
all have submitted to any touch.</p>

is even a sentence worthy of a place in the world’s wisdom. In short, He did himself
touch others, upon whom He laid His hands, which were capable of being felt, and conferred
the blessings of healing,3690 which were not less true, not less unimaginary, than were the
hands wherewith He bestowed them. He was therefore the very Christ of Isaiah, the healer
of our sicknesses.3691 “Surely,” says he, “He hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.”
Now the Greeks are accustomed to use for carry a word which also signifies to take away.
A general promise is enough for me in passing.3692 Whatever were the cures which Jesus
effected, He is mine. We will come, however, to the kinds of cures. To liberate men, then,
from evil spirits, is a cure of sickness. Accordingly, wicked spirits (just in the manner of
our former example) used to go forth with a testimony, exclaiming, “Thou art the Son of
God,”3693—of what God, is clear enough from the case itself. But they were rebuked, and
ordered not to speak; precisely because3694 Christ willed Himself to be proclaimed by men,
not by unclean spirits, as the Son of God—even that Christ alone to whom this was befitting,
because He had sent beforehand men through whom He might become known, and who
were assuredly worthier preachers. It was natural to Him3695 to refuse the proclamation of
an unclean spirit, at whose command there was an abundance of saints. He, however,3696
who had never been foretold (if, indeed, he wished to be acknowledged; for if he did not
wish so much, his coming was in vain), would not have spurned the testimony of an alien
or any sort of substance, who did not happen to have a substance of his own,3697 but had
descended in an alien one. And now, too, as the destroyer also of the Creator, he would have
desired nothing better than to be acknowledged by His spirits, and to be divulged for the
sake of being feared:3698 only that Marcion says3699 that his god is not feared; maintaining
that a good being is not an object of fear, but only a judicial being, in whom reside the

grounds3700 of fear—anger, severity, judgments, vengeance, condemnation. But it was from
fear, undoubtedly, that the evil spirits were cowed.3701 Therefore they confessed that (Christ)
was the Son of a God who was to be feared, because they would have an occasion of not
submitting if there were none for fearing. Besides, He showed that He was to be feared,
because He drave them out, not by persuasion like a good being, but by command and reproof.
Or else did he3702 reprove them, because they were making him an object of fear,
when all the while he did not want to be feared? And in what manner did he wish them to
go forth, when they could not do so except with fear? So that he fell into the dilemma3703
of having to conduct himself contrary to his nature, whereas he might in his simple goodness
have at once treated them with leniency. He fell, too, into another false position3704—of
prevarication, when he permitted himself to be feared by the demons as the Son of the
Creator, that he might drive them out, not indeed by his own power, but by the authority
of the Creator. “He departed, and went into a desert place.”3705 This was, indeed, the Creator’s
customary region. It was proper that the Word3706 should there appear in body, where He
had aforetime, wrought in a cloud. To the gospel also was suitable that condition of place3707
which had once been determined on for the law.3708 “Let the wilderness and the solitary
place, therefore, be glad and rejoice;” so had Isaiah promised.3709 When “stayed” by the
crowds, He said, “I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also.”3710 Had He displayed
His God anywhere yet? I suppose as yet nowhere. But was He speaking of those who
knew of another god also? I do not believe so. If, therefore, neither He had preached, nor
they had known, any other God but the Creator, He was announcing the kingdom of that
God whom He knew to be the only God known to those who were listening to Him.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—Out of St. Luke’s Fifth Chapter are Found Proofs of Christ’s Belonging
to the Creator, E.g. In the Call of Fishermen to the Apostolic Office, and in the
Cleansing of the Leper. Christ Compared with the Prophet Elisha.</head>
<p>Out of so many kinds of occupations, why indeed had He such respect for that of fishermen,
as to select from it for apostles Simon and the sons of Zebedee (for it cannot seem
to be the mere fact itself for which the narrative was meant to be drawn out3711), saying to
Peter, when he trembled at the very large draught of the fishes, “Fear not; from henceforth
thou shalt catch men?”3712 By saying this, He suggested to them the meaning of the fulfilled
prophecy, that it was even He who by Jeremiah had foretold, “Behold, I will send many
fishers; and they shall fish them,”3713 that is, men. Then at last they left their boats, and
followed Him, understanding that it was He who had begun to accomplish what He had
declared. It is quite another case, when he affected to choose from the college of shipmasters,
intending one day to appoint the shipmaster Marcion his apostle. We have indeed already
laid it down, in opposition to his Antitheses, that the position of Marcion derives no advantage
from the diversity which he supposes to exist between the Law and the Gospel, inasmuch
as even this was ordained by the Creator, and indeed predicted in the promise of the new
Law, and the new Word, and the new Testament. Since, however, he quotes with especial
care,3714 as a proof in his domain,3715 a certain companion in misery (συνταλαίπωρον),
and associate in hatred (συμμισούμενον ), with himself, for the cure of leprosy,3716 I shall
not be sorry to meet him, and before anything else to point out to him the force of the law
figuratively interpreted, which, in this example of a leper (who was not to be touched, but
was rather to be removed from all intercourse with others), prohibited any communication
with a person who was defiled with sins, with whom the apostle also forbids us even to eat
food,3717 forasmuch as the taint of sins would be communicated as if contagious, wherever
a man should mix himself with the sinner. The Lord, therefore, wishing that the law should
be more profoundly understood as signifying spiritual truths by carnal facts3718—and

thus3719 not destroying, but rather building up, that law which He wanted to have more
earnestly acknowledged—touched the leper, by whom (even although as man He might
have been defiled) He could not be defiled as God, being of course incorruptible. The prescription,
therefore, could not be meant for Him, that He was bound to observe the law and
not touch the unclean person, seeing that contact with the unclean would not cause defilement
to Him. I thus teach that this (immunity) is consistent in my Christ, the rather when
I show that it is not consistent in yours. Now, if it was as an enemy3720 of the law that He
touched the leper—disregarding the precept of the law by a contempt of the defilement—how
could he be defiled, when he possessed not a body3721 which could be defiled? For a phantom
is not susceptible of defilement. He therefore, who could not be defiled, as being a phantom,
will not have an immunity from pollution by any divine power, but owing to his fantastic
vacuity; nor can he be regarded as having despised pollution, who had not in fact any material
capacity3722 for it; nor, in like manner, as having destroyed the law, who had escaped
defilement from the occasion of his phantom nature, not from any display of virtue. If,
however, the Creator’s prophet Elisha cleansed Naaman the Syrian alone,3723 to the exclusion
of3724 so many lepers in Israel,3725 this fact contributes nothing to the distinction of Christ,
as if he were in this way the better one for cleansing this Israelite leper, although a stranger
to him, whom his own Lord had been unable to cleanse. The cleansing of the Syrian rather3726
was significant throughout the nations of the world3727 of their own cleansing in Christ
their light,3728 steeped as they were in the stains of the seven deadly sins:3729 idolatry, blasphemy,

as if once for each,3731 did he wash in Jordan; both in order that he might celebrate the expiation
of a perfect hebdomad;3732 and because the virtue and fulness of the one baptism
was thus solemnly imputed3733 to Christ, alone, who was one day to establish on earth not
only a revelation, but also a baptism, endued with compendious efficacy.3734 Even Marcion
finds here an antithesis:3735 how that Elisha indeed required a material resource, applied
water, and that seven times; whereas Christ, by the employment of a word only, and that
but once for all, instantly effected3736 the cure. And surely I might venture3737 to claim3738
the Very Word also as of the Creator’s substance. There is nothing of which He who was
the primitive Author is not also the more powerful one. Forsooth,3739 it is incredible that
that power of the Creator should have, by a word, produced a remedy for a single malady,
which once by a word brought into being so vast a fabric as the world! From what can the
Christ of the Creator be better discerned, than from the power of His word? But Christ is
on this account another (Christ), because He acted differently from Elisha—because, in fact,
the master is more powerful than his servant! Why, Marcion, do you lay down the rule, that
things are done by servants just as they are by their very masters? Are you not afraid that it
will turn to your discredit, if you deny that Christ belongs to the Creator, on the ground
that He was once more powerful than a servant of the Creator—since, in comparison with
the weakness of Elisha, He is acknowledged to be the greater, if indeed greater!3740 For the
cure is the same, although there is a difference in the working of it. What has your Christ
performed more than my Elisha? Nay, what great thing has the word of your Christ per-
<note type="footnote">scurity to Tertullian’s arguing on the Marcionite hypothesis. “Marcion,” says he, “held that the prophets, like
Elisha, belonged to the Creator, and Christ to the good God. To magnify Christ’s beneficence, he prominently
dwells on the alleged fact, that Christ, although a stranger to the Creator’s world, yet vouchsafed to do good in
it. This vain conceit Tertullian refutes from the Marcionite hypothesis itself. God the Creator, said they, had
found Himself incapable of cleansing this Israelite; but He had more easily cleansed the Syrian. Christ, however,
cleansed the Israelite, and so showed himself the superior power. Tertullian denies both positions.”</note>

formed, when it has simply done that which a river of the Creator effected? On the same
principle occurs all the rest. So far as renouncing all human glory went, He forbade the man
to publish abroad the cure; but so far as the honour of the law was concerned, He requested
that the usual course should be followed: “Go, show thyself to the priest, and present the
offering which Moses commanded.”3741 For the figurative signs of the law in its types He
still would have observed, because of their prophetic import.3742 These types signified that
a man, once a sinner, but afterwards purified3743 from the stains thereof by the word of
God, was bound to offer unto God in the temple a gift, even prayer and thanksgiving in the
church through Christ Jesus, who is the Catholic Priest of the Father.3744 Accordingly He
added: “that it may be for a testimony unto you”—one, no doubt, whereby He would testify
that He was not destroying the law, but fulfilling it; whereby, too, He would testify that it
was He Himself who was foretold as about to undertake3745 their sicknesses and infirmities.
This very consistent and becoming explanation of “the testimony,” that adulator of his own
Christ, Marcion seeks to exclude under the cover of mercy and gentleness. For, being both
good (such are his words), and knowing, besides, that every man who had been freed from
leprosy would be sure to perform the solemnities of the law, therefore He gave this precept.
Well, what then? Has He continued in his goodness (that is to say, in his permission of the
law) or not? For if he has persevered in his goodness, he will never become a destroyer of
the law; nor will he ever be accounted as belonging to another god, because there would not
exist that destruction of the law which would constitute his claim to belong to the other
god. If, however, he has not continued good, by a subsequent destruction of the law, it is a
false testimony which he has since imposed upon them in his cure of the leper; because he
has forsaken his goodness, in destroying the law. If, therefore, he was good whilst upholding
the law,3746 he has now become evil as a destroyer of the law. However, by the support
which he gave to the law, he affirmed that the law was good. For no one permits himself in
the support of an evil thing. Therefore he is not only bad if he has permitted obedience to
a bad law; but even worse still, if he has appeared3747 as the destroyer of a good law. So that
if he commanded the offering of the gift because he knew that every cured leper would be
sure to bring one; he possibly abstained from commanding what he knew would be spontaneously
done. In vain, therefore, was his coming down, as if with the intention of destroying

the law, when he makes concessions to the keepers of the law. And yet,3748 because he knew
their disposition,3749 he ought the more earnestly to have prevented their neglect of the
law,3750 since he had come for this purpose. Why then did he not keep silent, that man
might of his own simple will obey the law? For then might he have seemed to some extent3751
to have persisted in his patience. But he adds also his own authority increased by the weight
of this “testimony.” Of what testimony, I ask,3752 if not that of the assertion of the law?
Surely it matters not in what way he asserted the law—whether as good, or as supererogatory,
3753 or as patient, or as inconstant—provided, Marcion, I drive you from your position.
3754 Observe,3755 he commanded that the law should be fulfilled. In whatever way he
commanded it, in the same way might he also have first uttered that sentiment:3756 “I came
not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it.”3757 What business, therefore, had you to erase out
of the Gospel that which was quite consistent in it?3758 For you have confessed that, in his
goodness, he did in act what you deny that he did in word.3759 We have therefore good

<head>Chapter X.—Further Proofs of the Same Truth in the Same Chapter, from the
Healing of the Paralytic, and from the Designation Son of Man Which Jesus
Gives Himself. Tertullian Sustains His Argument by Several Quotations from
the Prophets.</head>
<p>The sick of the palsy is healed,3761 and that in public, in the sight of the people. For,
says Isaiah, “they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God.”3762 What
glory, and what excellency? “Be strong, ye weak hands, and ye feeble knees:”3763 this refers
to the palsy. “Be strong; fear not.”3764 Be strong is not vainly repeated, nor is fear not vainly
added; because with the renewal of the limbs there was to be, according to the promise, a
restoration also of bodily energies: “Arise, and take up thy couch;” and likewise moral
courage3765 not to be afraid of those who should say, “Who can forgive sins, but God alone?”
So that you have here not only the fulfilment of the prophecy which promised a particular
kind of healing, but also of the symptoms which followed the cure. In like manner, you
should also recognise Christ in the same prophet as the forgiver of sins. “For,” he says, “He
shall remit to many their sins, and shall Himself take away our sins.”3766 For in an earlier
passage, speaking in the person of the Lord himself, he had said: “Even though your sins
be as scarlet, I will make them as white as snow; even though they be like crimson, I will
whiten them as wool.”3767 In the scarlet colour He indicates the blood of the prophets; in
the crimson, that of the Lord, as the brighter. Concerning the forgiveness of sins, Micah
also says: “Who is a God like unto Thee? pardoning iniquity, and passing by the transgressions
of the remnant of Thine heritage. He retaineth not His anger as a testimony against
them, because He delighteth in mercy. He will turn again, and will have compassion upon
us; He wipeth away our iniquities, and casteth our sins into the depths of the sea.”3768 Now,
if nothing of this sort had been predicted of Christ, I should find in the Creator examples
of such a benignity as would hold out to me the promise of similar affections also in the Son
of whom He is the Father. I see how the Ninevites obtained forgiveness of their sins from
the Creator3769—not to say from Christ, even then, because from the beginning He acted

in the Father’s name. I read, too, how that, when David acknowledged his sin against Uriah,
the prophet Nathan said unto him, “The Lord hath cancelled3770 thy sin, and thou shalt not
die;”3771 how king Ahab in like manner, the husband of Jezebel, guilty of idolatry and of
the blood of Naboth, obtained pardon because of his repentance;3772 and how Jonathan the
son of Saul blotted out by his deprecation the guilt of a violated fast.3773 Why should I recount
the frequent restoration of the nation itself after the forgiveness of their sins?—by that God,
indeed, who will have mercy rather than sacrifice, and a sinner’s repentance rather than his
death.3774 You will first have to deny that the Creator ever forgave sins; then you must in
reason show3775 that He never ordained any such prerogative for His Christ; and so you
will prove how novel is that boasted3776 benevolence of the, of course, novel Christ when
you shall have proved that it is neither compatible with3777 the Creator nor predicted by
the Creator. But whether to remit sins can appertain to one who is said to be unable to retain
them, and whether to absolve can belong to him who is incompetent even to condemn, and
whether to forgive is suitable to him against whom no offence can be committed, are questions
which we have encountered elsewhere,3778 when we preferred to drop suggestions3779
rather than treat them anew.3780 Concerning the Son of man our rule3781 is a twofold one:
that Christ cannot lie, so as to declare Himself the Son of man, if He be not truly so; nor can
He be constituted the Son of man, unless He be born of a human parent, either father or
mother. And then the discussion will turn on the point, of which human parent He ought
to be accounted the son—of the father or the mother? Since He is (begotten) of God the
Father, He is not, of course, (the son) of a human father. If He is not of a human father, it
follows that He must be (the son) of a human mother. If of a human mother, it is evident
that she must be a virgin. For to whom a human father is not ascribed, to his mother a
husband will not be reckoned; and then to what mother a husband is not reckoned, the

to be reckoned to Him—a divine and a human one. For she must have a husband, not to
be a virgin; and by having a husband, she would cause two fathers—one divine, the other
human—to accrue to Him, who would thus be Son both of God and of a man. Such a
nativity (if one may call it so)3783 the mythic stories assign to Castor or to Hercules. Now,
if this distinction be observed, that is to say, if He be Son of man as born of His mother,
because not begotten of a father, and His mother be a virgin, because His father is not human—
He will be that Christ whom Isaiah foretold that a virgin should conceive,3784 on
what principle you, Marcion, can admit Him Son of man, I cannot possibly see. If through
a human father, then you deny him to be Son of God; if through a divine one also,3785 then
you make Christ the Hercules of fable; if through a human mother only, then you concede
my point; if not through a human father also,3786 then He is not the son of any man,3787
and He must have been guilty of a lie for having declared Himself to be what He was not.
One thing alone can help you in your difficulty: boldness on your part either to surname
your God as actually the human father of Christ, as Valentinus did3788 with his Æon; or
else to deny that the Virgin was human, which even Valentinus did not do. What now, if
Christ be described3789 in Daniel by this very title of “Son of man?” Is not this enough to
prove that He is the Christ of prophecy? For if He gives Himself that appellation which was
provided in the prophecy for the Christ of the Creator, He undoubtedly offers Himself to
be understood as Him to whom (the appellation) was assigned by the prophet. But perhaps3790
it can be regarded as a simple identity of names;3791 and yet we have maintained3792
that neither Christ nor Jesus ought to have been called by these names, if they possessed
any condition of diversity. But as regards the appellation “Son of man,” in as far as it occurs
by accident,3793 in so far there is a difficulty in its occurrence along with3794 a casual identity

of names. For it is of pure3795 accident, especially when the same cause does not appear3796
whereby the identity may be occasioned. And therefore, if Marcion’s Christ be also said to
be born of man, then he too would receive an identical appellation, and there would be two
Sons of man, as also two Christs and two Jesuses. Therefore, since the appellation is the
sole right of Him in whom it has a suitable reason,3797 if it be claimed for another in whom
there is an identity of name, but not of appellation,3798 then the identity of name even looks
suspicious in him for whom is claimed without reason the identity of appellation. And it
follows that He must be believed to be One and the Same, who is found to be the more fit
to receive both the name and the appellation; while the other is excluded, who has no right
to the appellation, because he has no reason to show for it. Nor will any other be better entitled
to both than He who is the earlier, and has had allotted to Him the name of Christ
and the appellation of Son of man, even the Jesus of the Creator. It was He who was seen
by the king of Babylon in the furnace with His martyrs: “the fourth, who was like the Son
of man.”3799 He also was revealed to Daniel himself expressly as “the Son of man, coming
in the clouds of heaven” as a Judge, as also the Scripture shows.3800 What I have advanced
might have been sufficient concerning the designation in prophecy of the Son of man. But
the Scripture offers me further information, even in the interpretation of the Lord Himself.
For when the Jews, who looked at Him as merely man, and were not yet sure that He was
God also, as being likewise the Son of God, rightly enough said that a man could not forgive
sins, but God alone, why did He not, following up their point3801 about man, answer them,
that He3802 had power to remit sins; inasmuch as, when He mentioned the Son of man, He
also named a human being? except it were because He wanted, by help of the very designation
“Son of man” from the book of Daniel, so to induce them to reflect3803 as to show them
that He who remitted sins was God and man—that only Son of man, indeed, in the prophecy
of Daniel, who had obtained the power of judging, and thereby, of course, of forgiving sins
likewise (for He who judges also absolves); so that, when once that objection of theirs3804

was shattered to pieces by their recollection of Scripture, they might the more easily acknowledge
Him to be the Son of man Himself by His own actual forgiveness of sins. I make one
more observation,3805 how that He has nowhere as yet professed Himself to be the Son of
God—but for the first time in this passage, in which for the first time He has remitted sins;
that is, in which for the first time He has used His function of judgment, by the absolution.
All that the opposite side has to allege in argument against these things, (I beg you) carefully
weigh3806 what it amounts to. For it must needs strain itself to such a pitch of infatuation
as, on the one hand, to maintain that (their Christ) is also Son of man, in order to save Him
from the charge of falsehood; and, on the other hand, to deny that He was born of woman,
lest they grant that He was the Virgin’s son. Since, however, the divine authority and the
nature of the case, and common sense, do not admit this insane position of the heretics, we
have here the opportunity of putting in a veto3807 in the briefest possible terms, on the
substance of Christ’s body, against Marcion’s phantoms. Since He is born of man, being the
Son of man. He is body derived from body.3808 You may, I assure you,3809 more easily find
a man born without a heart or without brains, like Marcion himself, than without a body,
like Marcion’s Christ. And let this be the limit to your examination of the heart, or, at any
rate, the brains of the heretic of Pontus.3810</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—The Call of Levi the Publican. Christ in Relation to the Baptist. Christ
as the Bridegroom. The Parable of the Old Wine and the New. Arguments
Connecting Christ with the Creator.</head>
<p>The publican who was chosen by the Lord,3811 he adduces for a proof that he was chosen
as a stranger to the law and uninitiated in3812 Judaism, by one who was an adversary to the
law. The case of Peter escaped his memory, who, although he was a man of the law, was not
only chosen by the Lord, but also obtained the testimony of possessing knowledge which
was given to him by the Father.3813 He had nowhere read of Christ’s being foretold as the
light, and hope, and expectation of the Gentiles! He, however, rather spoke of the Jews in a
favourable light, when he said, “The whole needed not a physician, but they that are sick.”3814
For since by “those that are sick” he meant that the heathens and publicans should be understood,
whom he was choosing, he affirmed of the Jews that they were “whole” for whom
he said that a physician was not necessary. This being the case, he makes a mistake in coming
down3815 to destroy the law, as if for the remedy of a diseased condition. because they who
were living under it were “whole,” and “not in want of a physician.” How, moreover, does
it happen that he proposed the similitude of a physician, if he did not verify it? For, just as
nobody uses a physician for healthy persons, so will no one do so for strangers, in so far as
he is one of Marcion’s god-made men,3816 having to himself both a creator and preserver,
and a specially good physician, in his Christ. This much the comparison predetermines,
that a physician is more usually furnished by him to whom the sick people belong. Whence,
too, does John come upon the scene? Christ, suddenly; and just as suddenly, John!3817 After
this fashion occur all things in Marcion’s system. They have their own special and plenary
course3818 in the Creator’s dispensation. Of John, however, what else I have to say will be
found in another passage.3819 To the several points which now come before us an answer
must be given. This, then, I will take care to do3820—demonstrate that, reciprocally, John
is suitable to Christ, and Christ to John, the latter, of course, as a prophet of the Creator,

just as the former is the Creator’s Christ; and so the heretic may blush at frustrating, to his
own frustration, the mission of John the Baptist. For if there had been no ministry of John
at all—“the voice,” as Isaiah calls him, “of one crying in the wilderness,” and the preparer
of the ways of the Lord by denunciation and recommendation of repentance; if, too, he had
not baptized (Christ) Himself3821 along with others, nobody could have challenged the
disciples of Christ, as they ate and drank, to a comparison with the disciples of John, who
were constantly fasting and praying; because, if there existed any diversity3822 between
Christ and John, and their followers respectively, no exact comparison would be possible,
nor would there be a single point where it could be challenged. For nobody would feel surprise,
and nobody would be perplexed, although there should arise rival predictions of a
diverse deity, which should also mutually differ about modes of conduct,3823 having a prior
difference about the authorities3824 upon which they were based. Therefore Christ belonged
to John, and John to Christ; while both belonged to the Creator, and both were of the law
and the prophets, preachers and masters. Else Christ would have rejected the discipline of
John, as of the rival god, and would also have defended the disciples, as very properly pursuing
a different walk, because consecrated to the service of another and contrary deity.
But as it is, while modestly3825 giving a reason why “the children of the bridegroom are
unable to fast during the time the bridegroom is with them,” but promising that “they should
afterwards fast, when the bridegroom was taken away from them,”3826 He neither defended
the disciples, (but rather excused them, as if they had not been blamed without some reason),
nor rejected the discipline of John, but rather allowed3827 it, referring it to the time of John,
although destining it for His own time. Otherwise His purpose would have been to reject
it,3828 and to defend its opponents, if He had not Himself already belonged to it as then in
force. I hold also that it is my Christ who is meant by the bridegroom, of whom the psalm
says: “He is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber; His going forth is from the end of
the heaven, and His return is back to the end of it again.”3829 By the mouth of Isaiah He
also says exultingly of the Father: “Let my soul rejoice in the Lord; for He hath clothed me

with the garment of salvation and with the tunic of joy, as a bridegroom. He hath put a
mitre round about my head, as a bride.”3830 To Himself likewise He appropriates3831 the
church, concerning which the same3832 Spirit says to Him: “Thou shalt clothe Thee with
them all, as with a bridal ornament.”3833 This spouse Christ invites home to Himself also
by Solomon from the call of the Gentiles, because you read: “Come with me from Lebanon,
my spouse.”3834 He elegantly makes mention of Lebanon (the mountain, of course) because
it stands for the name of frankincense with the Greeks;3835 for it was from idolatry that He
betrothed Himself the church. Deny now, Marcion, your utter madness, (if you can)! Behold,
you impugn even the law of your god. He unites not in the nuptial bond, nor, when contracted,
does he allow it; no one does he baptize but a cælebs or a eunuch; until death or divorce
does he reserve baptism.3836 Wherefore, then, do you make his Christ a bridegroom? This
is the designation of Him who united man and woman, not of him who separated them.
You have erred also in that declaration of Christ, wherein He seems to make a difference
between things new and old. You are inflated about the old bottles, and brain-muddled with
the new wine; and therefore to the old (that is to say, to the prior) gospel you have sewed
on the patch of your new-fangled heresy. I should like to know in what respect the Creator
is inconsistent with Himself.3837 When by Jeremiah He gave this precept, “Break up for
yourselves new pastures,”3838 does He not turn away from the old state of things? And when
by Isaiah He proclaims how “old things were passed away; and, behold, all things, which I
am making, are new,”3839 does He not advert to a new state of things? We have generally
been of opinion3840 that the destination of the former state of things was rather promised
by the Creator, and exhibited in reality by Christ, only under the authority of one and the
same God, to whom appertain both the old things and the new. For new wine is not put
into old bottles, except by one who has the old bottles; nor does anybody put a new piece

to an old garment, unless the old garment be forthcoming to him. That person only3841
does not do a thing when it is not to be done, who has the materials wherewithal to do it if
it were to be done. And therefore, since His object in making the comparison was to show
that He was separating the new condition3842 of the gospel from the old state3843 of the law,
He proved that that3844 from which He was separating His own3845 ought not to have been
branded3846 as a separation3847 of things which were alien to each other; for nobody ever
unites his own things with things that are alien to them,3848 in order that he may afterwards
be able to separate them from the alien things. A separation is possible by help of the conjunction
through which it is made. Accordingly, the things which He separated He also
proved to have been once one; as they would have remained, were it not for His separation.
But still we make this concession, that there is a separation, by reformation, by amplification,
3849 by progress; just as the fruit is separated from the seed, although the fruit comes
from the seed. So likewise the gospel is separated from the law, whilst it advances3850 from
the law—a different thing3851 from it, but not an alien one; diverse, but not contrary. Nor
in Christ do we even find any novel form of discourse. Whether He proposes similitudes
or refute questions, it comes from the seventy-seventh Psalm. “I will open,” says He, “my
mouth in a parable” (that is, in a similitude); “I will utter dark problems” (that is, I will set
forth questions).3852 If you should wish to prove that a man belonged to another race, no

<head>Chapter XII.—Christ’s Authority Over the Sabbath. As Its Lord He Recalled It from
Pharisaic Neglect to the Original Purpose of Its Institution by the Creator the
Case of the Disciples Who Plucked the Ears of Corn on the Sabbath. The
Withered Hand Healed on the Sabbath.</head>
<p>Concerning the Sabbath also I have this to premise, that this question could not have
arisen, if Christ did not publicly proclaim3853 the Lord of the Sabbath. Nor could there be
any discussion about His annulling3854 the Sabbath, if He had a right3855 to annul it.
Moreover, He would have the right, if He belonged to the rival god; nor would it cause
surprise to any one that He did what it was right for Him to do. Men’s astonishment
therefore arose from their opinion that it was improper for Him to proclaim the Creator to
be God and yet to impugn His Sabbath. Now, that we may decide these several points first,
lest we should be renewing them at every turn to meet each argument of our adversary
which rests on some novel institution3856 of Christ, let this stand as a settled point, that
discussion concerning the novel character of each institution ensued on this account, because
as nothing was as yet advanced by Christ touching any new deity, so discussion thereon was
inadmissible; nor could it be retorted, that from the very novelty of each several institution
another deity was clearly enough demonstrated by Christ, inasmuch as it was plain that
novelty was not in itself a characteristic to be wondered at in Christ, because it had been
foretold by the Creator. And it would have been, of course, but right that a new3857 god
should first be expounded, and his discipline be introduced afterwards; because it would be
the god that would impart authority to the discipline, and not the discipline to the god; except
that (to be sure) it has happened that Marcion acquired his very perverse opinions not from
a master, but his master from his opinion! All other points respecting the Sabbath I thus
rule. If Christ interfered with3858 the Sabbath, He simply acted after the Creator’s example;
inasmuch as in the siege of the city of Jericho the carrying around the walls of the ark of the
covenant for eight days running, and therefore on a Sabbath-day, actually3859 annulled the
Sabbath, by the Creator’s command—according to the opinion of those who think this of
Christ in this passage of St. Luke, in their ignorance that neither Christ nor the Creator violated
the Sabbath, as we shall by and by show. And yet the Sabbath was actually then

broken3860 by Joshua,3861 so that the present charge might be alleged also against Christ.
But even if, as being not the Christ of the Jews, He displayed a hatred against the Jews’ most
solemn day, He was only professedly following3862 the Creator, as being His Christ, in this
very hatred of the Sabbath; for He exclaims by the mouth of Isaiah: “Your new moons and
your Sabbaths my soul hateth.”3863 Now, in whatever sense these words were spoken, we
know that an abrupt defence must, in a subject of this sort, be used in answer to an abrupt
challenge. I shall now transfer the discussion to the very matter in which the teaching of
Christ seemed to annul the Sabbath. The disciples had been hungry; on that the Sabbath
day they had plucked some ears and rubbed them in their hands; by thus preparing their
food, they had violated the holy day. Christ excuses them, and became their accomplice in
breaking the Sabbath. The Pharisees bring the charge against Him. Marcion sophistically
interprets the stages of the controversy (if I may call in the aid of the truth of my Lord to
ridicule his arts), both in the scriptural record and in Christ’s purpose.3864 For from the
Creator’s Scripture, and from the purpose of Christ, there is derived a colourable precedent3865—
as from the example of David, when he went into the temple on the Sabbath, and
provided food by boldly breaking up the shew-bread.3866 Even he remembered that this
privilege (I mean the dispensation from fasting) was allowed to the Sabbath from the very
beginning, when the Sabbath-day itself was instituted. For although the Creator had forbidden
that the manna should be gathered for two days, He yet permitted it on the one occasion
only of the day before the Sabbath, in order that the yesterday’s provision of food might free
from fasting the feast of the following Sabbath-day. Good reason, therefore, had the Lord
for pursuing the same principle in the annulling of the Sabbath (since that is the word which
men will use); good reason, too, for expressing the Creator’s will,3867 when He bestowed
the privilege of not fasting on the Sabbath-day. In short, He would have then and there3868
put an end to the Sabbath, nay, to the Creator Himself, if He had commanded His disciples

to fast on the Sabbath-day, contrary to the intention3869 of the Scripture and of the Creator’s
will. But because He did not directly defend3870 His disciples, but excuses them; because
He interposes human want, as if deprecating censure; because He maintains the honour of
the Sabbath as a day which is to be free from gloom rather than from work;3871 because he
puts David and his companions on a level with His own disciples in their fault and their
extenuation; because He is pleased to endorse3872 the Creator’s indulgence:3873 because He
is Himself good according to His example—is He therefore alien from the Creator? Then
the Pharisees watch whether He would heal on the Sabbath-day,3874 that they might accuse
Him—surely as a violator of the Sabbath, not as the propounder of a new god; for perhaps
I might be content with insisting on all occasions on this one point, that another Christ3875
is nowhere proclaimed. The Pharisees, however, were in utter error concerning the law of
the Sabbath, not observing that its terms were conditional, when it enjoined rest from labour,
making certain distinctions of labour. For when it says of the Sabbath-day, “In it thou shalt
not do any work of thine,”3876 by the word thine3877 it restricts the prohibition to human
work—which every one performs in his own employment or business—and not to divine
work. Now the work of healing or preserving is not proper to man, but to God. So again,
in the law it says, “Thou shalt not do any manner of work in it,”3878 except what is to be
done for any soul,3879 that is to say, in the matter of delivering the soul;3880 because what
is God’s work may be done by human agency for the salvation of the soul. By God, however,
would that be done which the man Christ was to do, for He was likewise God.3881 Wishing,

therefore, to initiate them into this meaning of the law by the restoration of the withered
hand, He requires, “Is it lawful on the Sabbath-days to do good, or not? to save life, or to
destroy it?”3882 In order that He might, whilst allowing that amount of work which He was
about to perform for a soul,3883 remind them what works the law of the Sabbath forbade—
even human works; and what it enjoined—even divine works, which might be done
for the benefit of any soul,3884 He was called “Lord of the Sabbath,”3885 because He maintained3886
the Sabbath as His own institution. Now, even if He had annulled the Sabbath,
He would have had the right to do so,3887 as being its Lord, (and) still more as He who instituted
it. But He did not utterly destroy it, although its Lord, in order that it might
henceforth be plain that the Sabbath was not broken3888 by the Creator, even at the time
when the ark was carried around Jericho. For that was really3889 God’s work, which He
commanded Himself, and which He had ordered for the sake of the lives of His servants
when exposed to the perils of war. Now, although He has in a certain place expressed an
aversion of Sabbaths, by calling them your Sabbaths,3890 reckoning them as men’s Sabbaths,
not His own, because they were celebrated without the fear of God by a people full of
iniquities, and loving God “with the lip, not the heart,”3891 He has yet put His own Sabbaths
(those, that is, which were kept according to His prescription) in a different position; for
by the same prophet, in a later passage,3892 He declared them to be “true, and delightful,
and inviolable.” Thus Christ did not at all rescind the Sabbath: He kept the law thereof, and
both in the former case did a work which was beneficial to the life of His disciples, for He
indulged them with the relief of food when they were hungry, and in the present instance
cured the withered hand; in each case intimating by facts, “I came not to destroy, the law,

but to fulfil it,”3893 although Marcion has gagged3894 His mouth by this word.3895 For even
in the case before us He fulfilled the law, while interpreting its condition; moreover, He exhibits
in a clear light the different kinds of work, while doing what the law excepts from the
sacredness of the Sabbath3896 and while imparting to the Sabbath-day itself, which from
the beginning had been consecrated by the benediction of the Father, an additional sanctity
by His own beneficent action. For He furnished to this day divine safeguards,3897—a course
which3898 His adversary would have pursued for some other days, to avoid honouring the
Creator’s Sabbath, and restoring to the Sabbath the works which were proper for it. Since,
in like manner, the prophet Elisha on this day restored to life the dead son of the Shunammite
woman,3899 you see, O Pharisee, and you too, O Marcion, how that it was proper employment
for the Creator’s Sabbaths of old3900 to do good, to save life, not to destroy it; how that
Christ introduced nothing new, which was not after the example,3901 the gentleness, the
mercy, and the prediction also of the Creator. For in this very example He fulfils3902 the

<head>Chapter XIII.—Christ’s Connection with the Creator Shown. Many Quotations Out
of the Old Testament Prophetically Bear on Certain Events of the Life of Jesus—
Such as His Ascent to Praying on the Mountain; His Selection of Twelve
Apostles; His Changing Simon’s Name to Peter, and Gentiles from Tyre and
Sidon Resorting to Him.</head>
<p>Surely to Sion He brings good tidings, and to Jerusalem peace and all blessings; He goes
up into a mountain, and there spends a night in prayer,3904 and He is indeed heard by the
Father. Accordingly turn over the prophets, and learn therefrom His entire course.3905
“Into the high mountain,” says Isaiah, “get Thee up, who bringest good tidings to Sion; lift
up Thy voice with strength, who bringest good tidings to Jerusalem.”3906 “They were
mightily3907 astonished at His doctrine; for He was teaching as one who had power.”3908
And again: “Therefore, my people shall know my name in that day.” What name does the
prophet mean, but Christ’s? “That I am He that doth speak—even I.”3909 For it was He who
used to speak in the prophets—the Word, the Creator’s Son. “I am present, while it is the
hour, upon the mountains, as one that bringeth glad tidings of peace, as one that publisheth
good tidings of good.”3910 So one of the twelve (minor prophets), Nahum: “For behold upon
the mountain the swift feet of Him that bringeth glad tidings of peace.”3911 Moreover,
concerning the voice of His prayer to the Father by night, the psalm manifestly says: “O my
God, I will cry in the day-time, and Thou shalt hear; and in the night season, and it shall
not be in vain to me.”3912 In another passage touching the same voice and place, the psalm
says: “I cried unto the Lord with my voice, and He heard me out of His holy mountain.”3913
You have a representation of the name; you have the action of the Evangelizer; you have a
mountain for the site; and the night as the time; and the sound of a voice; and the audience
of the Father: you have, (in short,) the Christ of the prophets. But why was it that He chose
twelve apostles,3914 and not some other number? In truth,3915 I might from this very point

conclude3916 of my Christ, that He was foretold not only by the words of prophets, but by
the indications of facts. For of this number I find figurative hints up and down the Creator’s
dispensation3917 in the twelve springs of Elim;3918 in the twelve gems of Aaron’s priestly
vestment;3919 and in the twelve stones appointed by Joshua to be taken out of the Jordan,
and set up for the ark of the covenant. Now, the same number of apostles was thus portended,
as if they were to be fountains and rivers which should water the Gentile world, which was
formerly dry and destitute of knowledge (as He says by Isaiah: “I will put streams in the
unwatered ground”3920); as if they were to be gems to shed lustre upon the church’s sacred
robe, which Christ, the High Priest of the Father, puts on; as if, also, they were to be stones
massive in their faith, which the true Joshua took out of the laver of the Jordan, and placed
in the sanctuary of His covenant. What equally good defence of such a number has Marcion’s
Christ to show? It is impossible that anything can be shown to have been done by him unconnectedly,
3921 which cannot be shown to have been done by my Christ in connection
(with preceding types).3922 To him will appertain the event3923 in whom is discovered the
preparation for the same.3924 Again, He changes the name of Simon to Peter,3925 inasmuch
as the Creator also altered the names of Abram, and Sarai, and Oshea, by calling the latter
Joshua, and adding a syllable to each of the former. But why Peter? If it was because of the
vigour of his faith, there were many solid materials which might lend a name from their
strength. Was it because Christ was both a rock and a stone? For we read of His being placed
“for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence.”3926 I omit the rest of the passage.3927
Therefore He would fain3928 impart to the dearest of His disciples a name which was suggested
by one of His own especial designations in figure; because it was, I suppose, more
peculiarly fit than a name which might have been derived from no figurative description of

Himself.3929 There come to Him from Tyre, and from other districts even, a transmarine
multitude. This fact the psalm had in view: “And behold tribes of foreign people, and Tyre,
and the people of the Ethiopians; they were there. Sion is my mother, shall a man say; and
in her was born a man” (forasmuch as the God-man was born), and He built her by the
Father’s will; that you may know how Gentiles then flocked to Him, because He was born
the God-man who was to build the church according to the Father’s will—even of other
races also.3930 So says Isaiah too: “Behold, these come from far; and these from the north
and from the west;3931 and these from the land of the Persians.”3932 Concerning whom He
says again: “Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold, all these have gathered themselves
together.”3933 And yet again: “Thou seest these unknown and strange ones; and thou wilt
say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these? But who hath brought me up these? And
these, where have they been?”3934 Will such a Christ not be (the Christ) of the prophets?
And what will be the Christ of the Marcionites? Since perversion of truth is their pleasure,
he could not be (the Christ) of the prophets.</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—Christ’s Sermon on the Mount. In Manner and Contents It So Resembles
the Creator’s Dispensational Words and Deeds. It Suggests Therefore
the Conclusion that Jesus is the Creator’s Christ. The Beatitudes.</head>
<p>I now come to those ordinary precepts of His, by means of which He adapts the peculiarity3935
of His doctrine to what I may call His official proclamation as the Christ.3936
“Blessed are the needy” (for no less than this is required for interpreting the word in the
Greek,3937 “because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”3938 Now this very fact, that He begins
with beatitudes, is characteristic of the Creator, who used no other voice than that of blessing
either in the first fiat or the final dedication of the universe: for “my heart,” says He, “hath
indited a very good word.”3939 This will be that “very good word” of blessing which is admitted
to be the initiating principle of the New Testament, after the example of the Old.
What is there, then, to wonder at, if He entered on His ministry with the very attributes3940
of the Creator, who ever in language of the same sort loved, consoled, protected, and avenged
the beggar, and the poor, and the humble, and the widow, and the orphan? So that you may
believe this private bounty as it were of Christ to be a rivulet streaming from the springs of
salvation. Indeed, I hardly know which way to turn amidst so vast a wealth of good words
like these; as if I were in a forest, or a meadow, or an orchard of apples. I must therefore
look out for such matter as chance may present to me.3941</p>
<p>In the psalm he exclaims: “Defend the fatherless and the needy; do justice to the humble
and the poor; deliver the poor, and rid the needy out of the hand of the wicked.”3942 Similarly
in the seventy-first Psalm: “In righteousness shall He judge the needy amongst the people,
and shall save the children of the poor.”3943 And in the following words he says of Christ:
“All nations shall serve Him.”3944 Now David only reigned over the Jewish nation, so that

nobody can suppose that this was spoken of David; whereas He had taken upon Himself
the condition of the poor, and such as were oppressed with want, “Because He should deliver
the needy out of the hand of the mighty man; He shall spare the needy and the poor, and
shall deliver the souls of the poor. From usury and injustice shall He redeem their souls,
and in His sight shall their name be honoured.”3945 Again: “The wicked shall be turned
into hell, even all the nations that forget God; because the needy shall not alway be forgotten;
the endurance of the poor shall not perish for ever.”3946 Again: “Who is like unto the Lord
our God, who dwelleth on high, and yet looketh on the humble things that are in heaven
and on earth!—who raiseth up the needy from off the ground, and out of the dunghill exalteth
the poor; that He may set him with the princes of His people,”3947 that is, in His own kingdom.
And likewise earlier, in the book of Kings,3948 Hannah the mother of Samuel gives
glory to God in these words: “He raiseth the poor man from the ground, and the beggar,
that He may set him amongst the princes of His people (that is, in His own kingdom), and
on thrones of glory” (even royal ones).3949 And by Isaiah how He inveighs against the oppressors
of the needy! “What mean ye that ye set fire to my vineyard, and that the spoil of
the poor is in your houses? Wherefore do ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the face of
the needy?”3950 And again: “Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees; for in their
decrees they decree wickedness, turning aside the needy from judgment, and taking away
their rights from the poor of my people.”3951 These righteous judgments He requires for
the fatherless also, and the widows, as well as for consolation3952 to the very needy themselves.
“Do justice to the fatherless, and deal justly with the widow; and come, let us be reconciled,
3953 saith the Lord.”3954 To him, for whom in every stage of lowliness there is provided
so much of the Creator’s compassionate regard, shall be given that kingdom also which is
promised by Christ, to whose merciful compassion belong, and for a great while have belonged,
3955 those to whom the promise is made. For even if you suppose that the promises
of the Creator were earthly, but that Christ’s are heavenly, it is quite clear that heaven has

been as yet the property of no other God whatever, than Him who owns the earth also; quite
clear that the Creator has given even the lesser promises (of earthly blessing), in order that
I may more readily believe Him concerning His greater promises (of heavenly blessings)
also, than (Marcion’s god), who has never given proof of his liberality by any preceding
bestowal of minor blessings. “Blessed are they that hunger, for they shall be filled.”3956 I
might connect this clause with the former one, because none but the poor and needy suffer
hunger, if the Creator had not specially designed that the promise of a similar blessing should
serve as a preparation for the gospel, that so men might know it to be His.3957 For thus does
He say, by Isaiah, concerning those whom He was about to call from the ends of the
earth—that is, the Gentiles: “Behold, they shall come swiftly with speed:”3958 swiftly, because
hastening towards the fulness of the times; with speed, because unclogged by the weights of
the ancient law. They shall neither hunger nor thirst. Therefore they shall be filled,—a
promise which is made to none but those who hunger and thirst. And again He says: “Behold,
my servants shall be filled, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but ye
shall be thirsty.”3959 As for these oppositions, we shall see whether they are not premonitors
of Christ.3960 Meanwhile the promise of fulness to the hungry is a provision of God the
Creator. “Blessed are they that weep, for they shall laugh.”3961 Turn again to the passage
of Isaiah: “Behold, my servants shall exult with joy, but ye shall be ashamed; behold, my
servants shall be glad, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart.”3962 And recognise these oppositions
also in the dispensation of Christ. Surely gladness and joyous exultation is promised
to those who are in an opposite condition—to the sorrowful, and sad, and anxious. Just as
it is said in the 125th Psalm: “They who sow in tears shall reap in joy.”3963 Moreover,
laughter is as much an accessory to the exulting and glad, as weeping is to the sorrowful and
grieving. Therefore the Creator, in foretelling matters for laughter and tears, was the first
who said that those who mourned should laugh. Accordingly, He who began (His course)
with consolation for the poor, and the humble, and the hungry, and the weeping, was at
once eager3964 to represent Himself as Him whom He had pointed out by the mouth of
Isaiah: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach good

tidings unto the poor.”3965 “Blessed are the needy, because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”
3966 “He hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted.”3967 “Blessed are they that hunger,
for they shall be filled.”3968 “To comfort all that mourn.”3969 “Blessed are they that weep,
for they shall laugh.”3970 “To give unto them that mourn in Sion, beauty (or glory) for ashes,
and the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.”3971
Now since Christ, as soon as He entered on His course,3972 fulfilled such a ministration as
this, He is either, Himself, He who predicted His own coming to do all this; or else if he is
not yet come who predicted this, the charge to Marcion’s Christ must be a ridiculous one
(although I should perhaps add a necessary3973 one), which bade him say, “Blessed shall ye
be, when men shall hate you, and shall reproach you, and shall cast out your name as evil,
for the Son of man’s sake.”3974 In this declaration there is, no doubt, an exhortation to patience.
Well, what did the Creator say otherwise by Isaiah? “Fear ye not the reproach of
men, nor be diminished by their contempt.”3975 What reproach? what contempt? That
which was to be incurred for the sake of the Son of man. What Son of man? He who (is
come) according to the Creator’s will. Whence shall we get our proof? From the very cutting
off, which was predicted against Him; as when He says by Isaiah to the Jews, who were the
instigators of hatred against Him: “Because of you, my name is blasphemed amongst the
Gentiles;”3976 and in another passage: “Lay the penalty on3977 Him who surrenders3978 His
own life, who is held in contempt by the Gentiles, whether servants or magistrates.”3979
Now, since hatred was predicted against that Son of man who has His mission from the
Creator, whilst the Gospel testifies that the name of Christians, as derived from Christ, was

to be hated for the Son of man’s sake, because He is Christ, it determines the point that that
was the Son of man in the matter of hatred who came according to the Creator’s purpose,
and against whom the hatred was predicted. And even if He had not yet come, the hatred
of His name which exists at the present day could not in any case have possibly preceded
Him who was to bear the name.3980 But He has both suffered the penalty3981 in our presence,
and surrendered His life, laying it down for our sakes, and is held in contempt by the Gentiles.
And He who was born (into the world) will be that very Son of man on whose account our
name also is rejected.</p>

<p>“In the like manner,” says He,3982 “did their fathers unto the prophets.” What a turncoat3983
is Marcion’s Christ! Now the destroyer, now the advocate of the prophets! He destroyed
them as their rival, by converting their disciples; he took up their cause as their friend,
by stigmatizing3984 their persecutors. But,3985 in as far as the defence of the prophets could
not be consistent in the Christ of Marcion, who came to destroy them; in so far is it becoming
to the Creator’s Christ that He should stigmatize those who persecuted the prophets, for
He in all things accomplished their predictions. Again, it is more characteristic of the Creator
to upbraid sons with their fathers’ sins, than it is of that god who chastizes no man for
even his own misdeeds. But you will say, He cannot be regarded as defending the prophets
simply because He wished to affirm the iniquity of the Jews for their impious dealings with
their own prophets. Well, then, in this case,3986 no sin ought to have been charged against
the Jews: they were rather deserving of praise and approbation when they maltreated3987
those whom the absolutely good god of Marcion, after so long a time, bestirred himself3988
to destroy. I suppose, however, that by this time he had ceased to be the absolutely good
god;3989 he had now sojourned a considerable while even with the Creator, and was no
longer (like) the god of Epicurus3990 purely and simply. For see how he condescends3991
to curse, and proves himself capable of taking offence and feeling anger! He actually pronounces
a woe! But a doubt is raised against us as to the import of this word, as if it carried
with it less the sense of a curse than of an admonition. Where, however, is the difference,
since even an admonition is not given without the sting of a threat, especially when it is
embittered with a woe? Moreover, both admonition and threatening will be the resources
of him3992 who knows how to feel angry. For no one will forbid the doing of a thing with

an admonition or a threat, except him who will inflict punishment for the doing of it. No
one would inflict punishment, except him who was susceptible of anger. Others, again, admit
that the word implies a curse; but they will have it that Christ pronounced the woe, not as
if it were His own genuine feeling, but because the woe is from the Creator, and He wanted
to set forth to them the severity of the Creator in order that He might the more commend
His own long-suffering3993 in His beatitudes. Just as if it were not competent to the Creator,
in the pre-eminence of both His attributes as the good God and Judge, that, as He had made
clemency3994 the preamble of His benediction so He should place severity in the sequel of
His curses; thus fully developing His discipline in both directions, both in following out the
blessing and in providing against the curse.3995 He had already said of old, “Behold, I have
set before you blessing and cursing.”3996 Which statement was really a presage of3997 this
temper of the gospel. Besides, what sort of being is that who, to insinuate a belief in his own
goodness, invidiously contrasted3998 with it the Creator’s severity? Of little worth is the recommendation
which has for its prop the defamation of another. And yet by thus setting
forth the severity of the Creator, he, in fact, affirmed Him to be an object of fear.3999 Now
if He be an object of fear, He is of course more worthy of being obeyed than slighted; and
thus Marcion’s Christ begins to teach favourably to the Creator’s interests.4000 Then, on the
admission above mentioned, since the woe which has regard to the rich is the Creator’s, it
follows that it is not Christ, but the Creator, who is angry with the rich; while Christ approves
of4001 the incentives of the rich4002—I mean, their pride, their pomp,4003 their love of the
world, and their contempt of God, owing to which they deserve the woe of the Creator. But
how happens it that the reprobation of the rich does not proceed from the same God who
had just before expressed approbation of the poor? There is nobody but reprobates the opposite
of that which he has approved. If, therefore, there be imputed to the Creator the woe
pronounced against the rich, there must be claimed for Him also the promise of the blessing
upon the poor; and thus the entire work of the Creator devolves on Christ.—If to Marcion’s

god there be ascribed the blessing of the poor, he must also have imputed to him the malediction
of the rich; and thus will he become the Creator’s equal,4004 both good and judicial;
nor will there be left any room for that distinction whereby two gods are made; and when
this distinction is removed, there will remain the verity which pronounces the Creator to
be the one only God. Since, therefore, “woe” is a word indicative of malediction, or of some
unusually austere4005 exclamation; and since it is by Christ uttered against the rich, I shall
have to show that the Creator is also a despiser4006 of the rich, as I have shown Him to be
the defender4007 of the poor, in order that I may prove Christ to be on the Creator’s side in
this matter, even when He enriched Solomon.4008 But with respect to this man, since, when
a choice was left to him, he preferred asking for what he knew to be well-pleasing to
God—even wisdom—he further merited the attainment of the riches, which he did not
prefer. The endowing of a man indeed with riches, is not an incongruity to God, for by the
help of riches even rich men are comforted and assisted; moreover, by them many a work
of justice and charity is carried out. But yet there are serious faults4009 which accompany
riches; and it is because of these that woes are denounced on the rich, even in the Gospel.
“Ye have received,” says He, “your consolation;”4010 that is, of course, from their riches, in
the pomps and vanities of the world which these purchase for them. Accordingly, in Deuteronomy,
Moses says: “Lest, when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses,
and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, as well as thy silver and thy gold, thine heart
be then lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God.”4011 In similar terms, when king
Hezekiah became proud of his treasures, and gloried in them rather than in God before
those who had come on an embassy from Babylon,4012 (the Creator) breaks forth4013 against
him by the mouth of Isaiah: “Behold, the days come when all that is in thine house, and
that which thy fathers have laid up in store, shall be carried to Babylon.”4014 So by Jeremiah
likewise did He say: “Let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth even
glory in the Lord.”4015 Similarly against the daughters of Sion does He inveigh by Isaiah,

when they were haughty through their pomp and the abundance of their riches,4016 just as
in another passage He utters His threats against the proud and noble: “Hell hath enlarged
herself, and opened her mouth, and down to it shall descend the illustrious, and the great,
and the rich (this shall be Christ’s ‘woe to the rich’); and man4017 shall be humbled,” even
he that exalts himself with riches; “and the mighty man4018 shall be dishonoured,” even he
who is mighty from his wealth.4019 Concerning whom He says again: “Behold, the Lord of
hosts shall confound the pompous together with their strength: those that are lifted up shall
be hewn down, and such as are lofty shall fall by the sword.”4020 And who are these but the
rich? Because they have indeed received their consolation, glory, and honour and a lofty
position from their wealth. In Psalm xlviii. He also turns off our care from these and says:
“Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, and when his glory is increased: for when he
shall die, he shall carry nothing away; nor shall his glory descend along with him.”4021 So
also in Psalm lxi.: “Do not desire riches; and if they do yield you their lustre,4022 do not set
your heart upon them.”4023 Lastly, this very same woe is pronounced of old by Amos against
the rich, who also abounded in delights. “Woe unto them,” says he, “who sleep upon beds
of ivory, and deliciously stretch themselves upon their couches; who eat the kids from the
flocks of the goats, and sucking calves from the flocks of the heifers, while they chant to the
sound of the viol; as if they thought they should continue long, and were not fleeting; who
drink their refined wines, and anoint themselves with the costliest ointments.”4024 Therefore,
even if I could do nothing else than show that the Creator dissuades men from riches, without
at the same time first condemning the rich, in the very same terms in which Christ also did,
no one could doubt that, from the same authority, there was added a commination against
the rich in that woe of Christ, from whom also had first proceeded the dissuasion against
the material sin of these persons, that is, their riches. For such commination is the necessary
sequel to such a dissuasive. He inflicts a woe also on “the full, because they shall hunger;
on those too which laugh now, because they shall mourn.”4025 To these will correspond
these opposites which occur, as we have seen above, in the benedictions of the Creator:

“Behold, my servants shall be full, but ye shall be hungry”—even because ye have been filled;
“behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed”4026—even ye who shall mourn,
who now are laughing. For as it is written in the psalm, “They who sow in tears shall reap
in joy,”4027 so does it run in the Gospel: They who sow in laughter, that is, in joy, shall reap
in tears. These principles did the Creator lay down of old; and Christ has renewed them, by
simply bringing them into prominent view,4028 not by making any change in them. “Woe
unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.”
4029 With equal stress does the Creator, by His prophet Isaiah, censure those who seek
after human flattery and praise: “O my people, they who call you happy mislead you, and
disturb the paths of your feet.”4030 In another passage He forbids all implicit trust in man,
and likewise in the applause of man; as by the prophet Jeremiah: “Cursed be the man that
trusteth in man.”4031 Whereas in Psalm cxvii. it is said: “It is better to trust in the Lord than
to put confidence in man; it is better to trust in the Lord than to place hope in princes.”4032
Thus everything which is caught at by men is adjured by the Creator, down to their good
words.4033 It is as much His property to condemn the praise and flattering words bestowed
on the false prophets by their fathers, as to condemn their vexatious and persecuting treatment
of the (true) prophets. As the injuries suffered by the prophets could not be imputed4034
to their own God, so the applause bestowed on the false prophets could not have been displeasing
to any other god but the God of the true prophets.</p>

Sundry Precepts of Charity Explained.</head>
<p>“But I say unto you which hear” (displaying here that old injunction, of the Creator:
“Speak to the ears of those who lend them to you”4035), “Love your enemies, and bless4036
those which hate you, and pray for them which calumniate you.”4037 These commands the
Creator included in one precept by His prophet Isaiah: “Say, Ye are our brethren, to those
who hate you.”4038 For if they who are our enemies, and hate us, and speak evil of us, and
calumniate us, are to be called our brethren, surely He did in effect bid us bless them that
hate us, and pray for them who calumniate us, when He instructed us to reckon them as
brethren. Well, but Christ plainly teaches a new kind of patience,4039 when He actually
prohibits the reprisals which the Creator permitted in requiring “an eye for an eye,4040 and
a tooth for a tooth,”4041 and bids us, on the contrary, “to him who smiteth us on the one
cheek, to offer the other also, and to give up our coat to him that taketh away our cloak.”4042
No doubt these are supplementary additions by Christ, but they are quite in keeping with
the teaching of the Creator. And therefore this question must at once be determined,4043
Whether the discipline of patience be enjoined by4044 the Creator? When by Zechariah He
commanded, “Let none of you imagine evil against his brother,”4045 He did not expressly
include his neighbour; but then in another passage He says, “Let none of you imagine evil
in your hearts against his neighbour.”4046 He who counselled that an injury should be for-

gotten, was still more likely to counsel the patient endurance of it. But then, when He said,
“Vengeance is mine, and I will repay,”4047 He thereby teaches that patience calmly waits
for the infliction of vengeance. Therefore, inasmuch as it is incredible4048 that the same
(God) should seem to require “a tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye,” in return for an
injury, who forbids not only all reprisals, but even a revengeful thought or recollection of
an injury, in so far does it become plain to us in what sense He required “an eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth,”—not, indeed, for the purpose of permitting the repetition of the
injury by retaliating it, which it virtually prohibited when it forbade vengeance; but for the
purpose of restraining the injury in the first instance, which it had forbidden on pain of retaliation
or reciprocity;4049 so that every man, in view of the permission to inflict a second
(or retaliatory) injury, might abstain from the commission of the first (or provocative)
wrong. For He knows how much more easy it is to repress violence by the prospect of retaliation,
than by the promise of (indefinite) vengeance. Both results, however, it was necessary
to provide, in consideration of the nature and the faith of men, that the man who believed
in God might expect vengeance from God, while he who had no faith (to restrain him) might
fear the laws which prescribed retaliation.4050 This purpose4051 of the law, which it was
difficult to understand, Christ, as the Lord of the Sabbath and of the law, and of all the dispensations
of the Father, both revealed and made intelligible,4052 when He commanded
that “the other cheek should be offered (to the smiter),” in order that He might the more
effectually extinguish all reprisals of an injury, which the law had wished to prevent by the
method of retaliation, (and) which most certainly revelation4053 had manifestly restricted,
both by prohibiting the memory of the wrong, and referring the vengeance thereof to God.
Thus, whatever (new provision) Christ introduced, He did it not in opposition to the law,
but rather in furtherance of it, without at all impairing the prescription4054 of the Creator.
If, therefore,4055 one looks carefully4056 into the very grounds for which patience is enjoined
(and that to such a full and complete extent), one finds that it cannot stand if it is not the
precept of the Creator, who promises vengeance, who presents Himself as the judge (in the

case). If it were not so,4057—if so vast a weight of patience—which is to refrain from giving
blow for blow; which is to offer the other cheek; which is not only not to return railing for
railing, but contrariwise blessing; and which, so far from keeping the coat, is to give up the
cloak also—is laid upon me by one who means not to help me,—(then all I can say is,) he
has taught me patience to no purpose,4058 because he shows me no reward to his precept—I
mean no fruit of such patience. There is revenge which he ought to have permitted me to
take, if he meant not to inflict it himself; if he did not give me that permission, then he
should himself have inflicted it;4059 since it is for the interest of discipline itself that an injury
should be avenged. For by the fear of vengeance all iniquity is curbed. But if licence is allowed
to it without discrimination,4060 it will get the mastery—it will put out (a man’s) both eyes;
it will knock out4061 every tooth in the safety of its impunity. This, however, is (the principle)
of your good and simply beneficent god—to do a wrong to patience, to open the door to
violence, to leave the righteous undefended, and the wicked unrestrained! “Give to every
one that asketh of thee”4062—to the indigent of course, or rather to the indigent more especially,
although to the affluent likewise. But in order that no man may be indigent, you have
in Deuteronomy a provision commanded by the Creator to the creditor.4063 “There shall
not be in thine hand an indigent man; so that the Lord thy God shall bless thee with blessings,”
4064—thee meaning the creditor to whom it was owing that the man was not indigent.
But more than this. To one who does not ask, He bids a gift to be given. “Let there be, not,”
He says, “a poor man in thine hand;” in other words, see that there be not, so far as thy will
can prevent;4065 by which command, too, He all the more strongly by inference requires4066
men to give to him that asks, as in the following words also: “If there be among you a poor
man of thy brethren, thou shalt not turn away thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy
poor brother. But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him as
much as he wanteth.”4067 Loans are not usually given, except to such as ask for them. On

this subject of lending,4068 however, more hereafter.4069 Now, should any one wish to argue
that the Creator’s precepts extended only to a man’s brethren, but Christ’s to all that ask,
so as to make the latter a new and different precept, (I have to reply) that one rule only can
be made out of those principles, which show the law of the Creator to be repeated in
Christ.4070 For that is not a different thing which Christ enjoined to be done towards all
men, from that which the Creator prescribed in favour of a man’s brethren. For although
that is a greater charity, which is shown to strangers, it is yet not preferable to that4071 which
was previously due to one’s neighbours. For what man will be able to bestow the love (which
proceeds from knowledge of character,4072 upon strangers? Since, however, the second
step4073 in charity is towards strangers, while the first is towards one’s neighbours, the
second step will belong to him to whom the first also belongs, more fitly than the second
will belong to him who owned no first.4074 Accordingly, the Creator, when following the
course of nature, taught in the first instance kindness to neighbours,4075 intending afterwards
to enjoin it towards strangers; and when following the method of His dispensation, He
limited charity first to the Jews, but afterwards extended it to the whole race of mankind.
So long, therefore, as the mystery of His government4076 was confined to Israel, He properly
commanded that pity should be shown only to a man’s brethren; but when Christ had given
to Him “the Gentiles for His heritage, and the ends of the earth for His possession,” then
began to be accomplished what was said by Hosea: “Ye are not my people, who were my
people; ye have not obtained mercy, who once obtained mercy”4077—that is, the (Jewish)
nation. Thenceforth Christ extended to all men the law of His Father’s compassion, excepting
none from His mercy, as He omitted none in His invitation. So that, whatever was the ampler
scope of His teaching, He received it all in His heritage of the nations. “And as ye would
that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.”4078 In this command is no doubt

implied its counterpart: “And as ye would not that men should do to you, so should ye also
not do to them likewise.” Now, if this were the teaching of the new and previously unknown
and not yet fully proclaimed deity, who had favoured me with no instruction beforehand,
whereby I might first learn what I ought to choose or to refuse for myself, and to do to others
what I would wish done to myself, not doing to them what I should be unwilling to have
done to myself, it would certainly be nothing else than the chance-medley of my own sentiments4079
which he would have left to me, binding me to no proper rule of wish or action,
in order that I might do to others what I would like for myself, or refrain from doing to
others what I should dislike to have done to myself. For he has not, in fact, defined what I
ought to wish or not to wish for myself as well as for others, so that I shape my conduct4080
according to the law of my own will, and have it in my power4081 not to render4082 to another
what I would like to have rendered to myself—love, obedience, consolation, protection,
and such like blessings; and in like manner to do to another what I should be unwilling to
have done to myself—violence, wrong, insult, deceit, and evils of like sort. Indeed, the
heathen who have not been instructed by God act on this incongruous liberty of the will
and the conduct.4083 For although good and evil are severally known by nature, yet life is
not thereby spent4084 under the discipline of God, which alone at last teaches men the
proper liberty of their will and action in faith, as in the fear of God. The god of Marcion,
therefore, although specially revealed, was, in spite of his revelation, unable to publish any
summary of the precept in question, which had hitherto been so confined,4085 and obscure,
and dark, and admitting of no ready interpretation, except according to my own arbitrary
thought,4086 because he had provided no previous discrimination in the matter of such a
precept. This, however, was not the case with my God, for4087 He always and everywhere
enjoined that the poor, and the orphan, and the widow should be protected, assisted, refreshed;
thus by Isaiah He says: “Deal thy bread to the hungry, and them that are houseless
bring into thine house; when thou seest the naked, cover him.”4088 By Ezekiel also He thus
describes the just man: “His bread will he give to the hungry, and the naked will he cover

others what I would that they should do unto me. Accordingly, when He uttered such denunciations
as, “Thou shalt do no murder; thou shalt not commit adultery; thou shalt not
steal; thou shalt not bear false witness,”4090—He taught me to refrain from doing to others
what I should be unwilling to have done to myself; and therefore the precept developed in
the Gospel will belong to Him alone, who anciently drew it up, and gave it distinctive point,
and arranged it after the decision of His own teaching, and has now reduced it, suitably to
its importance,4091 to a compendious formula, because (as it was predicted in another passage)

<head>Chapter XVII.—Concerning Loans. Prohibition of Usury and the Usurious Spirit.
The Law Preparatory to the Gospel in Its Provisions; So in the Present Instance.
On Reprisals. Christ’s Teaching Throughout Proves Him to Be Sent by the
Creator.</head>
<p>And now, on the subject of a loan, when He asks, “And if ye lend to them of whom ye
hope to receive, what thank have ye?”4093 compare with this the following words of Ezekiel,
in which He says of the before-mentioned just man, “He hath not given his money upon
usury, nor will he take any increase”4094—meaning the redundance of interest,4095 which
is usury. The first step was to eradicate the fruit of the money lent,4096 the more easily to
accustom a man to the loss, should it happen, of the money itself, the interest of which he
had learnt to lose. Now this, we affirm, was the function of the law as preparatory to the
gospel. It was engaged in forming the faith of such as would learn,4097 by gradual stages,
for the perfect light of the Christian discipline, through the best precepts of which it was
capable,4098 inculcating a benevolence which as yet expressed itself but falteringly.4099 For
in the passage of Ezekiel quoted above He says, “And thou shalt restore the pledge of the
loan”4100—to him, certainly, who is incapable of repayment, because, as a matter of course,
He would not anyhow prescribe the restoration of a pledge to one who was solvent. Much
more clearly is it enjoined in Deuteronomy: “Thou shalt not sleep upon his pledge; thou
shalt be sure to return to him his garment about sunset, and he shall sleep in his own garment.”
4101 Clearer still is a former passage: “Thou shalt remit every debt which thy neighbour
oweth thee; and of thy brother thou shalt not require it, because it is called the release of
the Lord thy God.”4102 Now, when He commands that a debt be remitted to a man who
shall be unable to pay it (for it is a still stronger argument when He forbids its being asked
for from a man who is even able to repay it), what else does He teach than that we should
lend to those of whom we cannot receive again, inasmuch as He has imposed so great a loss
on lending? “And ye shall be the children of God.”4103 What can be more shameless, than

for him to be making us his children, who has not permitted us to make children for ourselves
by forbidding marriage?4104 How does he propose to invest his followers with a name which
he has already erased? I cannot be the son of a eunuch especially when I have for my Father
the same great Being whom the universe claims for its! For is not the Founder of the universe
as much a Father, even of all men, as (Marcion’s) castrated deity,4105 who is the maker of
no existing thing? Even if the Creator had not united male and female, and if He had not
allowed any living creature whatever to have children, I yet had this relation to Him4106
before Paradise, before the fall, before the expulsion, before the two became one.4107 I became
His son a second time,4108 as soon as He fashioned me4109 with His hands, and gave me
motion with His inbreathing. Now again He names me His son, not begetting me into natural
life, but into spiritual life.4110 “Because,” says He, “He is kind unto the unthankful and
to the evil.”4111 Well done,4112 Marcion! how cleverly have you withdrawn from Him the
showers and the sunshine, that He might not seem to be a Creator! But who is this kind
being4113 which hitherto has not been even known? How can he be kind who had previously
shown no evidences of such a kindness as this, which consists of the loan to us of sunshine
and rain?—who is not destined to receive from the human race (the homage due to that)
Creator,—who, up to this very moment, in return for His vast liberality in the gift of the
elements, bears with men while they offer to idols, more readily than Himself, the due returns
of His graciousness. But God is truly kind even in spiritual blessings. “The utterances4114
of the Lord are sweeter than honey and honeycombs.”4115 He then has taunted4116 men as
ungrateful who deserved to have their gratitude—even He, whose sunshine and rain even
you, O Marcion, have enjoyed, but without gratitude! Your god, however, had no right to
complain of man’s ingratitude, because he had used no means to make them grateful.

Compassion also does He teach: “Be ye merciful,” says He, “as your Father also that had
mercy upon you.”4117 This injunction will be of a piece with, “Deal thy bread to the hungry;
and if he be houseless, bring him into thine house; and if thou seest the naked, cover him;”4118
also with, “Judge the fatherless, plead with the widow.”4119 I recognise here that ancient
doctrine of Him who “prefers mercy to sacrifice.”4120 If, however, it be now some other
being which teaches mercy, on the ground of his own mercifulness, how happens it that he
has been wanting in mercy to me for so vast an age? “Judge not, and ye shall not be judged;
condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned; forgive, and ye shall be forgiven; give, and it
shall be given unto you: good measure, pressed down, and running over, shall men give
into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye measure withal, it shall be measured
to you again.”4121 As it seems to me, this passage announces a retribution proportioned to
the merits. But from whom shall come the retribution? If only from men, in that case he
teaches a merely human discipline and recompense; and in everything we shall have to obey
man: if from the Creator, as the Judge and the Recompenser of merits, then He compels
our submission to Him, in whose hands4122 He has placed a retribution which will be acceptable
or terrible according as every man shall have judged or condemned, acquitted or
dealt with,4123 his neighbour; if from (Marcion’s god) himself, he will then exercise a judicial
function which Marcion denies. Let the Marcionites therefore make their choice: Will it
not be just the same inconsistency to desert the prescription of their master, as to have Christ
teaching in the interest of men or of the Creator? But “a blind man will lead a blind man
into the ditch.”4124 Some persons believe Marcion. But “the disciple is not above his master.”
4125 Apelles ought to have remembered this—a corrector of Marcion, although his
disciple.4126 The heretic ought to take the beam out of his own eye, and then he may convict4127
the Christian, should he suspect a mote to be in his eye. Just as a good tree cannot
produce evil fruit, so neither can truth generate heresy; and as a corrupt tree cannot yield
good fruit, so heresy will not produce truth. Thus, Marcion brought nothing good out of

Cerdon’s evil treasure; nor Apelles out of Marcion’s.4128 For in applying to these heretics
the figurative words which Christ used of men in general, we shall make a much more
suitable interpretation of them than if we were to deduce out of them two gods, according
to Marcion’s grievous exposition.4129 I think that I have the best reason possible for insisting
still upon the position which I have all along occupied, that in no passage to be anywhere
found has another God been revealed by Christ. I wonder that in this place alone Marcion’s
hands should have felt benumbed in their adulterating labour.4130 But even robbers have
their qualms now and then. There is no wrong-doing without fear, because there is none
without a guilty conscience. So long, then, were the Jews cognisant of no other god but Him,
beside whom they knew none else; nor did they call upon any other than Him whom alone
they knew. This being the case, who will He clearly be4131 that said, “Why callest thou me
Lord, Lord?”4132 Will it be he who had as yet never been called on, because never yet revealed;
4133 or He who was ever regarded as the Lord, because known from the beginning—
even the God of the Jews? Who, again, could possibly have added, “and do not the
things which I say?” Could it have been he who was only then doing his best4134 to teach
them? Or He who from the beginning had addressed to them His messages4135 both by the
law and the prophets? He could then upbraid them with disobedience, even if He had no
ground at any time else for His reproof. The fact is, that He who was then imputing to them
their ancient obstinacy was none other than He who, before the coming of Christ, had addressed
to them these words, “This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart
standeth far off from me.”4136 Otherwise, how absurd it were that a new god, a new Christ,
the revealer of a new and so grand a religion should denounce as obstinate and disobedient
those whom he had never had it in his power to make trial of!</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Concerning the Centurion’s Faith. The Raising of the Widow’s
Son. John Baptist, and His Message to Christ; And the Woman Who Was a
Sinner. Proofs Extracted from All of the Relation of Christ to the Creator.</head>
<p>Likewise, when extolling the centurion’s faith, how incredible a thing it is, that He should
confess that He had “found so great a faith not even in Israel,”4137 to whom Israel’s faith
was in no way interesting!4138 But not from the fact (here stated by Christ)4139 could it have
been of any interest to Him to approve and compare what was hitherto crude, nay, I might
say, hitherto naught. Why, however, might He not have used the example of faith in anoth-
er4140 god? Because, if He had done so, He would have said that no such faith had ever had
existence in Israel; but as the case stands,4141 He intimates that He ought to have found so
great a faith in Israel, inasmuch as He had indeed come for the purpose of finding it, being
in truth the God and Christ of Israel, and had now stigmatized4142 it, only as one who would
enforce and uphold it. If, indeed, He had been its antagonist,4143 He would have preferred
finding it to be such faith,4144 having come to weaken and destroy it rather than to approve
of it. He raised also the widow’s son from death.4145 This was not a strange miracle.4146
The Creator’s prophets had wrought such; then why not His Son much rather? Now, so
evidently had the Lord Christ introduced no other god for the working of so momentous a
miracle as this, that all who were present gave glory to the Creator, saying: “A great prophet
is risen up among us, and God hath visited His people.”4147 What God? He, of course,
whose people they were, and from whom had come their prophets. But if they glorified the
Creator, and Christ (on hearing them, and knowing their meaning) refrained from correcting
them even in their very act of invoking4148 the Creator in that vast manifestation of His

glory in this raising of the dead, undoubtedly He either announced no other God but Him,
whom He thus permitted to be honoured in His own beneficent acts and miracles, or else
how happens it that He quietly permitted these persons to remain so long in their error,
especially as He came for the very purpose to cure them of their error? But John is offended4149
when he hears of the miracles of Christ, as of an alien god.4150 Well, I on my side4151
will first explain the reason of his offence, that I may the more easily explode the scandal4152
of our heretic. Now, that the very Lord Himself of all might, the Word and Spirit of the
Father,4153 was operating and preaching on earth, it was necessary that the portion of the
Holy Spirit which, in the form of the prophetic gift,4154 had been through John preparing
the ways of the Lord, should now depart from John,4155 and return back again of course to
the Lord, as to its all-embracing original.4156 Therefore John, being now an ordinary person,
and only one of the many,4157 was offended indeed as a man, but not because he expected
or thought of another Christ as teaching or doing nothing new, for he was not even expecting
such a one.4158 Nobody will entertain doubts about any one whom (since he knows him
not to exist) he has no expectation or thought of. Now John was quite sure that there was
no other God but the Creator, even as a Jew, especially as a prophet.4159 Whatever doubt

he felt was evidently rather4160 entertained about Him4161 whom he knew indeed to exist
but knew not whether He were the very Christ. With this fear, therefore, even John asks
the question, “Art thou He that should come, or look we for another?”4162—simply inquiring
whether He was come as He whom he was looking for. “Art thou He that should come?”
i.e. Art thou the coming One? “or look we for another?” i.e. Is He whom we are expecting
some other than Thou, if Thou art not He whom we expect to come? For he was supposing,
4163 as all men then thought, from the similarity of the miraculous evidences,4164 that
a prophet might possibly have been meanwhile sent, from whom the Lord Himself, whose
coming was then expected, was different, and to whom He was superior.4165 And there lay
John’s difficulty.4166 He was in doubt whether He was actually come whom all men were
looking for; whom, moreover, they ought to have recognised by His predicted works, even
as the Lord sent word to John, that it was by means of these very works that He was to be
recognised.4167 Now, inasmuch as these predictions evidently related to the Creator’s
Christ—as we have proved in the examination of each of them—it was perverse enough, if
he gave himself out to be not the Christ of the Creator, and rested the proof of his statement
on those very evidences whereby he was urging his claims to be received as the Creator’s
Christ. Far greater still is his perverseness when, not being the Christ of John,4168 he yet
bestows on John his testimony, affirming him to be a prophet, nay more, his messenger,4169
applying to him the Scripture, “Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall
prepare thy way before thee.”4170 He graciously4171 adduced the prophecy in the superior
sense of the alternative mentioned by the perplexed John, in order that, by affirming that
His own precursor was already come in the person of John, He might quench the doubt4172
which lurked in his question: “Art thou He that should come, or look we for another?” Now

that the forerunner had fulfilled his mission, and the way of the Lord was prepared, He
ought now to be acknowledged as that (Christ) for whom the forerunner had made ready
the way. That forerunner was indeed “greater than all of women born;”4173 but for all that,
He who was least in the kingdom of God4174 was not subject to him;4175 as if the kingdom
in which the least person was greater than John belonged to one God, while John, who was
greater than all of women born, belonged himself to another God. For whether He speaks
of any “least person” by reason of his humble position, or of Himself, as being thought to
be less than John—since all were running into the wilderness after John rather than after
Christ (“What went ye out into the wilderness to see?”4176)—the Creator has equal right4177
to claim as His own both John, greater than any born of women, and Christ, or every “least
person in the kingdom of heaven,” who was destined to be greater than John in that kingdom,
although equally pertaining to the Creator, and who would be so much greater than the
prophet,4178 because he would not have been offended at Christ, an infirmity which then
lessened the greatness of John. We have already spoken of the forgiveness4179 of sins. The
behaviour of “the woman which was a sinner,” when she covered the Lord’s feet with her
kisses, bathed them with her tears, wiped them with the hairs of her head, anointed them
with ointment,4180 produced an evidence that what she handled was not an empty
phantom,4181 but a really solid body, and that her repentance as a sinner deserved forgiveness
according to the mind of the Creator, who is accustomed to prefer mercy to sacrifice.4182

Saviour, He pronounces a blessing on such as should not be offended in Himself or in John. Nor should they
devise for themselves whatsoever things they heard not from him. He also has a greater object in view, on account
of which the Saviour said this; even that no one should think that John (who was pronounced to be greater than
any born of women) was greater than the Saviour Himself, because even He was born of a woman. He guards
against this mistake, and says, ‘Blessed is he who shall not be offended in me.’ He then adds, ‘He that is least in
the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.’ Now, in respect of His birth in the flesh, the Saviour was less than
he by the space of six months. But in the kingdom He was greater, being even his God. For the Only-begotten
came not to say aught in secret, or to utter a falsehood in His preaching, as He says Himself, ‘In secret have I

Isaiah the Lord called these wealthy ladies—“Rise up, ye women that are at ease, and hear
my voice”4184—that He might prove4185 them first as disciples, and then as assistants and
helpers: “Daughters, hear my words in hope; this day of the year cherish the memory of, in
labour with hope.” For it was “in labour” that they followed Him, and “with hope” did they
minister to Him. On the subject of parables, let it suffice that it has been once for all shown
that this kind of language4186 was with equal distinctness promised by the Creator. But
there is that direct mode of His speaking4187 to the people—“Ye shall hear with the ear, but
ye shall not understand”4188—which now claims notice as having furnished to Christ that
frequent form of His earnest instruction: “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.”4189 Not
as if Christ, actuated with a diverse spirit, permitted a hearing which the Creator had refused;
but because the exhortation followed the threatening. First came, “Ye shall hear with the
ear, but shall not understand;” then followed, “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.” For
they wilfully refused to hear, although they had ears. He, however, was teaching them that
it was the ears of the heart which were necessary; and with these the Creator had said that
they would not hear. Therefore it is that He adds by His Christ, “Take heed how ye hear,”4190
and hear not,—meaning, of course, with the hearing of the heart, not of the ear. If you only
attach a proper sense to the Creator’s admonition,4191 suitable to the meaning of Him who
was rousing the people to hear by the words, “Take heed how ye hear,” it amounted to a
menace to such as would not hear. In fact,4192 that most merciful god of yours, who judges
not, neither is angry, is minatory. This is proved even by the sentence which immediately

follows: “Whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall
be taken even that which he seemeth to have.”4193 What shall be given? The increase of
faith, or understanding, or even salvation. What shall be taken away? That, of course, which
shall be given. By whom shall the gift and the deprivation be made? If by the Creator it be
taken away, by Him also shall it be given. If by Marcion’s god it be given, by Marcion’s god
also will it be taken away. Now, for whatever reason He threatens the “deprivation,” it will
not be the work of a god who knows not how to threaten, because incapable of anger. I am,
moreover, astonished when he says that “a candle is not usually hidden,”4194 who had hidden
himself—a greater and more needful light—during so long a time; and when he promises
that “everything shall be brought out of its secrecy and made manifest,”4195 who hitherto
has kept his god in obscurity, waiting (I suppose) until Marcion be born. We now come to
the most strenuously-plied argument of all those who call in question the Lord’s nativity.
They say that He testifies Himself to His not having been born, when He asks, “Who is my
mother, and who are my brethren?”4196 In this manner heretics either wrest plain and simple
words to any sense they choose by their conjectures, or else they violently resolve by a literal
interpretation words which imply a conditional sense and are incapable of a simple solution,
4197 as in this passage. We, for our part, say in reply, first, that it could not possibly
have been told Him that His mother and His brethren stood without, desiring to see Him,
if He had had no mother and no brethren. They must have been known to him who announced
them, either some time previously, or then at that very time, when they desired to
see Him, or sent Him their message. To this our first position this answer is usually given
by the other side. But suppose they sent Him the message for the purpose of tempting Him?
Well, but the Scripture does not say so; and inasmuch as it is usual for it to indicate what is
done in the way of temptation (“Behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him;”4198
again, when inquiring about tribute, the Pharisees came to Him, tempting Him4199), so,
when it makes no mention of temptation, it does not admit the interpretation of temptation.
However, although I do not allow this sense, I may as well ask, by way of a superfluous refutation,
for the reasons of the alleged temptation, To what purpose could they have tempted
Him by naming His mother and His brethren? If it was to ascertain whether He had been
born or not—when was a question raised on this point, which they must resolve by tempting

Him in this way? Who could doubt His having been born, when they4200 saw Him before
them a veritable man?—whom they had heard call Himself “Son of man?”—of whom they
doubted whether He were God or Son of God, from seeing Him, as they did, in the perfect
garb of human quality?—supposing Him rather to be a prophet, a great one indeed,4201 but
still one who had been born as man? Even if it had been necessary that He should thus be
tried in the investigation of His birth, surely any other proof would have better answered
the trial than that to be obtained from mentioning those relatives which it was quite possible
for Him, in spite of His true nativity, not at that moment to have had. For tell me now, does
a mother live on contemporaneously4202 with her sons in every case? Have all sons brothers
born for them?4203 May a man rather not have fathers and sisters (living), or even no relatives
at all? But there is historical proof4204 that at this very time4205 a census had been taken in
Judæa by Sentius Saturninus,4206 which might have satisfied their inquiry respecting the
family and descent of Christ. Such a method of testing the point had therefore no consistency
whatever in it and they “who were standing without” were really “His mother and His
brethren.” It remains for us to examine His meaning when He resorts to non-literal4207
words, saying “Who is my mother or my brethren?” It seems as if His language amounted

Augustus determined to impart the sanction of religion to his institution. The agent through whom Saturninus

mentions Sentius Saturninus again in De Pallio, i. Tertullian’s statement in the text has weighed with Sanclemente
and others, who suppose that Saturninus was governor of Judæa at the time of our Lord’s birth, which they place
in 747 a.u.c. “It is evident, however,” says Wieseler, “that this argument is far from decisive; for the New Testament
itself supplies far better aids for determining this question than the discordant ecclesiastical traditions—different
fathers giving different dates, which might be appealed to with equal justice; while Tertullian is even inconsistent
with himself, since in his treatise Adv. Jud. viii., he gives 751 a.u.c. as the year of our Lord’s birth” (Wieseler’s
Chronological Synopsis by Venables, p. 99, note 2). This Sentius Saturninus filled the office of governor of Syria,
744–748. For the elaborate argument of Aug. W. Zumpt, by which he defends St. Luke’s chronology, and goes
far to prove that Publius Sulpicius Quirinus (or “Cyrenius”) was actually the governor of Syria at the time of
the Lord’s birth, the reader may be referred to a careful abridgment by the translator of Wieseler’s work, pp.

to a denial of His family and His birth; but it arose actually from the absolute nature of the
case, and the conditional sense in which His words were to be explained.4208 He was justly
indignant, that persons so very near to Him “stood without,” while strangers were within
hanging on His words, especially as they wanted to call Him away from the solemn work
He had in hand. He did not so much deny as disavow4209 them. And therefore, when to the
previous question, “Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?”4210 He added the answer
“None but they who hear my words and do them,” He transferred the names of blood-relationship
to others, whom He judged to be more closely related to Him by reason of their
faith. Now no one transfers a thing except from him who possesses that which is transferred.
If, therefore, He made them “His mother and His brethren” who were not so, how could
He deny them these relationships who really had them? Surely only on the condition of
their deserts, and not by any disavowal of His near relatives; teaching them by His own actual
example,4211 that “whosoever preferred father or mother or brethren to the Word of
God, was not a disciple worthy of Him.”4212 Besides,4213 His admission of His mother and
His brethren was the more express, from the fact of His unwillingness to acknowledge them.
That He adopted others only confirmed those in their relationship to Him whom He refused
because of their offence, and for whom He substituted the others, not as being truer relatives,
but worthier ones. Finally, it was no great matter if He did prefer to kindred (that) faith
which it4214 did not possess.4215</p>

<p>But “what manner of man is this? for He commandeth even the winds and water!”4216
Of course He is the new master and proprietor of the elements, now that the Creator is deposed,
and excluded from their possession! Nothing of the kind. But the elements own4217
their own Maker, just as they had been accustomed to obey His servants also. Examine well
the Exodus, Marcion; look at the rod of Moses, as it waves His command to the Red Sea,
ampler than all the lakes of Judæa. How the sea yawns from its very depths, then fixes itself
in two solidified masses, and so, out of the interval between them,4218 makes a way for the
people to pass dry-shod across; again does the same rod vibrate, the sea returns in its strength,
and in the concourse of its waters the chivalry of Egypt is engulphed! To that consummation
the very winds subserved! Read, too, how that the Jordan was as a sword, to hinder the
emigrant nation in their passage across its stream; how that its waters from above stood
still, and its current below wholly ceased to run at the bidding of Joshua,4219 when his priests
began to pass over!4220 What will you say to this? If it be your Christ that is meant above,
he will not be more potent than the servants of the Creator. But I should have been content
with the examples I have adduced without addition,4221 if a prediction of His present passage
on the sea had not preceded Christ’s coming. As psalm is, in fact, accomplished by this4222
crossing over the lake. “The Lord,” says the psalmist, “is upon many waters.”4223 When He

figure, Æneid, viii. 62, 64, for a justification of the simile. Oehler has altered the reading from the “ex sortefamilæ,”
etc., of the mss. to “extorrifamiliæ,” etc. The former reading would mean probably: “Read out of the story of the
nation how that Jordan was as a sword to hinder their passage across its stream.” The sorte (or, as yet another
variation has it, “et sortes,” “the accounts”) meant the national record, as we have it in the beginning of the book
of Joshua. But the passage is almost hopelessly obscure.</note>

disperses its waves, Habakkuk’s words are fulfilled, where he says, “Scattering the waters in
His passage.”4224 When at His rebuke the sea is calmed, Nahum is also verified: He rebuketh
the sea, and maketh it dry,”4225 including the winds indeed, whereby it was disquieted. With
what evidence would you have my Christ vindicated? Shall it come from the examples, or
from the prophecies, of the Creator? You suppose that He is predicted as a military and
armed warrior,4226 instead of one who in a figurative and allegorical sense was to wage a
spiritual warfare against spiritual enemies, in spiritual campaigns, and with spiritual weapons:
come now, when in one man alone you discover a multitude of demons calling itself Legion,
4227 of course comprised of spirits, you should learn that Christ also must be understood
to be an exterminator of spiritual foes, who wields spiritual arms and fights in spiritual strife;
and that it was none other than He,4228 who now had to contend with even a legion of
demons. Therefore it is of such a war as this that the Psalm may evidently have spoken:
“The Lord is strong, The Lord is mighty in battle.”4229 For with the last enemy death did
He fight, and through the trophy of the cross He triumphed. Now of what God did the Legion
testify that Jesus was the Son?4230 No doubt, of that God whose torments and abyss they
knew and dreaded. It seems impossible for them to have remained up to this time in ignorance
of what the power of the recent and unknown god was working in the world, because
it is very unlikely that the Creator was ignorant thereof. For if He had been at any time ignorant
that there was another god above Himself, He had by this time at all events discovered
that there was one at work4231 below His heaven. Now, what their Lord had discovered had
by this time become notorious to His entire family within the same world and the same
circuit of heaven, in which the strange deity dwelt and acted.4232 As therefore both the
Creator and His creatures4233 must have had knowledge of him, if he had been in existence,
so, inasmuch as he had no existence, the demons really knew none other than the Christ of
their own God. They do not ask of the strange god, what they recollected they must beg of
the Creator—not to be plunged into the Creator’s abyss. They at last had their request
granted. On what ground? Because they had lied? Because they had proclaimed Him to be

the Son of a ruthless God? And what sort of god will that be who helped the lying, and upheld
his detractors? However, no need of this thought, for,4234 inasmuch as they had not lied,
inasmuch as they had acknowledged that the God of the abyss was also their God, so did
He actually Himself affirm that He was the same whom these demons acknowledged—Jesus,
the Judge and Son of the avenging God. Now, behold an inkling4235 of the Creator’s failings4236
and infirmities in Christ; for I on my side4237 mean to impute to Him ignorance.
Allow me some indulgence in my effort against the heretic. Jesus is touched by the woman
who had an issue of blood,4238 He knew not by whom. “Who touched me?” He asks, when
His disciples alleged an excuse. He even persists in His assertion of ignorance: “Somebody
hath touched me,” He says, and advances some proof: “For I perceive that virtue is gone
out of me.” What says our heretic? Could Christ have known the person? And why did He
speak as if He were ignorant? Why? Surely it was to challenge her faith, and to try her fear.
Precisely as He had once questioned Adam, as if in ignorance: Adam, where art thou?”4239
Thus you have both the Creator excused in the same way as Christ, and Christ acting similarly
to4240 the Creator. But in this case He acted as an adversary of the law; and therefore, as the
law forbids contact with a woman with an issue,4241 He desired not only that this woman
should touch Him, but that He should heal her.4242 Here, then, is a God who is not merciful
by nature, but in hostility! Yet, if we find that such was the merit of this woman’s faith, that
He said unto her, Thy faith hath saved thee,”4243 what are you, that you should detect an
hostility to the law in that act, which the Lord Himself shows us to have been done as a reward
of faith? But will you have it that this faith of the woman consisted in the contempt which
she had acquired for the law? Who can suppose, that a woman who had been. hitherto unconscious
of any God, uninitiated as yet in any new law, should violently infringe that law
by which she was up to this time bound? On what faith, indeed, was such an infringement
hazarded? In what God believing? Whom despising? The Creator? Her touch at least was
an act of faith. And if of faith in the Creator, how could she have violated His law,4244 when

she was ignorant of any other God? Whatever her infringement of the law amounted to, it
proceeded from and was proportionate to her faith in the Creator. But how can these two
things be compatible? That she violated the law, and violated it in faith, which ought to have
restrained her from such violation? I will tell you how her faith was this above all:4245 it
made her believe that her God preferred mercy even to sacrifice; she was certain that her
God was working in Christ; she touched Him, therefore, nor as a holy man simply, nor as
a prophet, whom she knew to be capable of contamination by reason of his human nature,
but as very God, whom she assumed to be beyond all possibility of pollution by any uncleanness.
4246 She therefore, not without reason,4247 interpreted for herself the law, as meaning
that such things as are susceptible of defilement become defiled, but not so God, whom she
knew for certain to be in Christ. But she recollected this also, that what came under the
prohibition of the law4248 was that ordinary and usual issue of blood which proceeds from
natural functions every month, and in childbirth, not that which was the result of disordered
health. Her case, however, was one of long abounding4249 ill health, for which she knew
that the succour of God’s mercy was needed, and not the natural relief of time. And thus
she may evidently be regarded as having discerned4250 the law, instead of breaking it. This
will prove to be the faith which was to confer intelligence likewise. “If ye will not believe,”
says (the prophet), “ye shall not understand.”4251 When Christ approved of the faith of this
woman, which simply rested in the Creator, He declared by His answer to her,4252 that He
was Himself the divine object of the faith of which He approved. Nor can I overlook the
fact that His garment, by being touched, demonstrated also the truth of His body; for of
course”4253 it was a body, and not a phantom, which the garment clothed.4254 This indeed
is not our point now; but the remark has a natural bearing on the question we are discussing.
For if it were not a veritable body, but only a fantastic one, it could not for certain have received
contamination, as being an unsubstantial thing.4255 He therefore, who, by reason of
this vacuity of his substance, was incapable of contamination, how could he possibly have

<p>He sends forth His disciples to preach the kingdom of God.4257 Does He here say of
what God? He forbids their taking anything for their journey, by way of either food or
raiment. Who would have given such a commandment as this, but He who feeds the ravens
and clothes4258 the flowers of the field? Who anciently enjoined for the treading ox an unmuzzled
mouth,4259 that he might be at liberty to gather his fodder from his labour, on the
principle that the worker is worthy of his hire?4260 Marcion may expunge such precepts,
but no matter, provided the sense of them survives. But when He charges them to shake
off the dust of their feet against such as should refuse to receive them, He also bids that this
be done as a witness. Now no one bears witness except in a case which is decided by judicial
process; and whoever orders inhuman conduct to be submitted to the trial by testimony,4261
does really threaten as a judge. Again, that it was no new god which recommended4262 by
Christ, was clearly attested by the opinion of all men, because some maintained to Herod
that Jesus was the Christ; others, that He was John; some, that He was Elias; and others, that
He was one of the old prophets.4263 Now, whosoever of all these He might have been, He
certainly was not raised up for the purpose of announcing another god after His resurrection.
He feeds the multitude in the desert place;4264 this, you must know4265 was after the manner
of the Old Testament.4266 Or else,4267 if there was not the same grandeur, it follows that
He is now inferior to the Creator. For He, not for one day, but during forty years, not on
the inferior aliment of bread and fish, but with the manna of heaven, supported the lives4268

of not five thousand, but of six hundred thousand human beings. However, such was the
greatness of His miracle, that He willed the slender supply of food, not only to be enough,
but even to prove superabundant;4269 and herein He followed the ancient precedent. For
in like manner, during the famine in Elijah’s time, the scanty and final meal of the widow
of Sarepta was multiplied4270 by the blessing of the prophet throughout the period of the

servitor, after contrasting the large number of the persons with the small supply of the food,
answered, “What, shall I set this before a hundred men?” he said again, “Give them, and
they shall eat: for thus saith the Lord, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof, according to
the word of the Lord.”4274 O Christ, even in Thy novelties Thou art old! Accordingly, when
Peter, who had been an eye-witness of the miracle, and had compared it with the ancient
precedents, and had discovered in them prophetic intimations of what should one day come
to pass, answered (as the mouthpiece of them all) the Lord’s inquiry, “Whom say ye that I
am?”4275 in the words, “Thou art the Christ,” he could not but have perceived that He was
that Christ, beside whom he knew of none else in the Scriptures, and whom he was now
surveying4276 in His wonderful deeds. This conclusion He even Himself confirms by thus
far bearing with it, nay, even enjoining silence respecting it.4277 For if Peter was unable to
acknowledge Him to be any other than the Creator’s Christ, while He commanded them
“to tell no man that saying,” surely4278 He was unwilling to have the conclusion promulged
which Peter had drawn. No doubt of that,4279 you say; but as Peter’s conclusion was a wrong
one, therefore He was unwilling to have a lie disseminated. It was, however, a different
reason which He assigned for the silence, even because “the Son of man must suffer many
things, and be rejected of the elders, and scribes, and priests, and be slain, and be raised

again the third day.”4280 Now, inasmuch as these sufferings were actually foretold for the
Creator’s Christ (as we shall fully show in the proper place4281), so by this application of
them to His own case4282 does He prove that it is He Himself of whom they were predicted.
At all events, even if they had not been predicted, the reason which He alleged for imposing
silence (on the disciples) was such as made it clear enough that Peter had made no mistake,
that reason being the necessity of His undergoing these sufferings. “Whosoever,” says He,
“will save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall
save it.”4283 Surely4284 it is the Son of man4285 who uttered this sentence. Look carefully,
then, along with the king of Babylon, into his burning fiery furnace, and there you will discover
one “like the Son of man” (for He was not yet really Son of man, because not yet born
of man), even as early as then4286 appointing issues such as these. He saved the lives of the
three brethren,4287 who had agreed to lose them for God’s sake; but He destroyed those of
the Chaldæans, when they had preferred to save them by the means of their idolatry. Where
is that novelty, which you pretend4288 in a doctrine which possesses these ancient proofs?
But all the predictions have been fulfilled4289 concerning martyrdoms which were to happen,
and were to receive the recompenses of their reward from God. “See,” says Isaiah, “how the
righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and just men are taken away, and no
man considereth.”4290 When does this more frequently happen than in the persecution of
His saints? This, indeed, is no ordinary matter,4291 no common casualty of the law of nature;
but it is that illustrious devotion, that fighting for the faith, wherein whosoever loses his life
for God saves it, so that you may here again recognize the Judge who recompenses the evil
gain of life with its destruction, and the good loss thereof with its salvation. It is, however,
a jealous God whom He here presents to me; one who returns evil for evil. “For whosoever,”
says He, “shall be ashamed of me, of him will I also be ashamed.”4292 Now to none but my

Christ can be assigned the occasion4293 of such a shame as this. His whole course4294 was
so exposed to shame as to open a way for even the taunts of heretics, declaiming4295 with
all the bitterness in their power against the utter disgrace4296 of His birth and bringing-up,
and the unworthiness of His very flesh.4297 But how can that Christ of yours be liable to a
shame, which it is impossible for him to experience? Since he was never condensed4298 into
human flesh in the womb of a woman, although a virgin; never grew from human seed, although
only after the law of corporeal substance, from the fluids4299 of a woman; was never
deemed flesh before shaped in the womb; never called foetus4300 after such shaping; was
never delivered from a ten months’ writhing in the womb;4301 was never shed forth upon
the ground, amidst the sudden pains of parturition, with the unclean issue which flows at
such a time through the sewerage of the body, forthwith to inaugurate the light4302 of life
with tears, and with that primal wound which severs the child from her who bears him;4303
never received the copious ablution, nor the meditation of salt and honey;4304 nor did he

own uncleanness, in his mother’s lap; nibbling at her breast; long an infant; gradually4307
a boy; by slow degrees4308 a man.4309 But he was revealed4310 from heaven, full-grown at
once, at once complete; immediately Christ; simply spirit, and power, and god. But as
withal he was not true, because not visible; therefore he was no object to be ashamed of from
the curse of the cross, the real endurance4311 of which he escaped, because wanting in
bodily substance. Never, therefore, could he have said, “Whosoever shall be ashamed of
me.” But as for our Christ, He could do no otherwise than make such a declaration;4312
“made” by the Father “a little lower than the angels,”4313 “a worm and no man, a reproach
of men, and despised of the people;”4314 seeing that it was His will that “with His stripes we
should be healed,”4315 that by His humiliation our salvation should be established. And
justly did He humble Himself4316 for His own creature man, for the image and likeness of
Himself, and not of another, in order that man, since he had not felt ashamed when bowing
down to a stone or a stock, might with similar courage give satisfaction to God for the
shamelessness of his idolatry, by displaying an equal degree of shamelessness in his faith,
in not being ashamed of Christ. Now, Marcion, which of these courses is better suited to
your Christ, in respect of a meritorious shame?4317 Plainly, you ought yourself to blush with
shame for having given him a fictitious existence.4318</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—The Same Conclusion Supported by the Transfiguration. Marcion
Inconsistent in Associating with Christ in Glory Two Such Eminent Servants of
the Creator as Moses and Elijah. St. Peter’s Ignorance Accounted for on
Montanist Principle.</head>
<p>You ought to be very much ashamed of yourself on this account too, for permitting him
to appear on the retired mountain in the company of Moses and Elias,4319 whom he had
come to destroy. This, to be sure,4320 was what he wished to be understood as the meaning
of that voice from heaven: “This is my beloved Son, hear Him”4321—Him, that is, not Moses
or Elias any longer. The voice alone, therefore, was enough, without the display of Moses
and Elias; for, by expressly mentioning whom they were to hear, he must have forbidden
all4322 others from being heard. Or else, did he mean that Isaiah and Jeremiah and the others
whom he did not exhibit were to be heard, since he prohibited those whom he did display?
Now, even if their presence was necessary, they surely should not be represented as conversing
together, which is a sign of familiarity; nor as associated in glory with him, for this indicates
respect and graciousness; but they should be shown in some slough4323 as a sure token of
their ruin, or even in that darkness of the Creator which Christ was sent to disperse, far removed
from the glory of Him who was about to sever their words and writings from His
gospel. This, then, is the way4324 how he demonstrates them to be aliens,4325 even by
keeping them in his own company! This is how he shows they ought to be relinquished: he
associates them with himself instead! This is how he destroys them: he irradiates them with
his glory! How would their own Christ act? I suppose He would have imitated the
frowardness (of heresy),4326 and revealed them just as Marcion’s Christ was bound to do,
or at least as having with Him any others rather than His own prophets! But what could so
well befit the Creator’s Christ, as to manifest Him in the company of His own foreannouncers?
4327—to let Him be seen with those to whom He had appeared in revelations?—to let
Him be speaking with those who had spoken of Him?—to share His glory with those by
whom He used to be called the Lord of glory; even with those chief servants of His, one of

whom was once the moulder4328 of His people, the other afterwards the reformer4329
thereof; one the initiator of the Old Testament, the other the consummator4330 of the New?
Well therefore does Peter, when recognizing the companions of his Christ in their indissoluble
connection with Him, suggest an expedient: “It is good for us to be here” (good: that
evidently means to be where Moses and Elias are); “and let us make three tabernacles, one
for Thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. But he knew not what he said.”4331 How
knew not? Was his ignorance the result of simple error? Or was it on the principle which
we maintain4332 in the cause of the new prophecy,4333 that to grace ecstasy or rapture4334
is incident. For when a man is rapt in the Spirit, especially when he beholds the glory of
God, or when God speaks through him, he necessarily loses his sensation,4335 because he
is overshadowed with the power of God,—a point concerning which there is a question
between us and the carnally-minded.4336 Now, it is no difficult matter to prove the rapture4337
of Peter. For how could he have known Moses and Elias, except (by being) in the
Spirit? People could not have had their images, or statues, or likenesses; for that the law
forbade. How, if it were not that he had seen them in the Spirit? And therefore, because it
was in the Spirit that he had now spoken, and not in his natural senses, he could not know
what he had said. But if, on the other hand,4338 he was thus ignorant, because he erroneously

supposed that (Jesus) was their Christ, it is then evident that Peter, when previously asked
by Christ, “Whom they thought Him to be,” meant the Creator’s Christ, when he answered,
“Thou art the Christ;” because if he had been then aware that He belonged to the rival god,
he would not have made a mistake here. But if he was in error here because of his previous
erroneous opinion,4339 then you may be sure that up to that very day no new divinity had
been revealed by Christ, and that Peter had so far made no mistake, because hitherto Christ
had revealed nothing of the kind; and that Christ accordingly was not to be regarded as be-
longing to any other than the Creator, whose entire dispensation4340 he, in fact, here described.
He selects from His disciples three witnesses of the impending vision and voice.
And this is just the way of the Creator. “In the mouth of three witnesses,” says He, “shall
every word be established.”4341 He withdraws to a mountain. In the nature of the place I
see much meaning. For the Creator had originally formed His ancient people on a mountain
both with visible glory and His voice. It was only right that the New Testament should be
attested4342 on such an elevated spot4343 as that whereon the Old Testament had been
composed;4344 under a like covering of cloud also, which nobody will doubt, was condensed
out of the Creator’s air. Unless, indeed, he4345 had brought down his own clouds thither,
because he had himself forced his way through the Creator’s heaven;4346 or else it was only
a precarious cloud,4347 as it were, of the Creator which he used. On the present (as also on
the former)4348 occasion, therefore, the cloud was not silent; but there was the accustomed
voice from heaven, and the Father’s testimony to the Son; precisely as in the first Psalm He
had said, “Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee.”4349 By the mouth of Isaiah also
He had asked concerning Him, “Who is there among you that feareth God? Let him hear
the voice of His Son.”4350 When therefore He here presents Him with the words, “This is
my (beloved) Son,” this clause is of course understood, “whom I have promised.” For if He

once promised, and then afterwards says, “This is He,” it is suitable conduct for one who
accomplishes His purpose4351 that He should utter His voice in proof of the promise which
He had formerly made; but unsuitable in one who is amenable to the retort, Can you, indeed,
have a right to say, “This is my son,” concerning whom you have given us no previous information,
4352 any more than you have favoured us with a revelation about your own prior
existence? “Hear ye Him,” therefore, whom from the beginning (the Creator) had declared
entitled to be heard in the name of a prophet, since it was as a prophet that He had to be
regarded by the people. “A prophet,” says Moses, “shall the Lord your God raise up unto
you, of your sons” (that is, of course, after a carnal descent4353); “unto Him shall ye hearken,
as unto me.”4354 “Every one who will not hearken unto Him, his soul4355 shall be cut off
from amongst his people.”4356 So also Isaiah: “Who is there among you that feareth God?
Let him hear the voice of His Son.”4357 This voice the Father was going Himself to recommend.
For, says he,4358 He establishes the words of His Son, when He says, “This is my beloved
Son, hear ye Him.” Therefore, even if there be made a transfer of the obedient “hearing”
from Moses and Elias to4359 Christ, it is still not from another God, or to another Christ;
but from4360 the Creator to His Christ, in consequence of the departure of the old covenant
and the supervening of the new. “Not an ambassador, nor an angel, but He Himself,” says
Isaiah, “shall save them;”4361 for it is He Himself who is now declaring and fulfilling the law
and the prophets. The Father gave to the Son new disciples,4362 after that Moses and Elias

the approving words of God upon the mount are in Heb. i. 5 applied to the Son, while in Ps. ii. 7 the Son applies
them to Himself. Compare the Adversus Praxean, chap. xix. (Fr. Junius and Oehler). It is, however, more likely
that Tertullian really means to quote Isa. xliv. 26, “that confirmeth the word of His servant,” which Tertullian

had been exhibited along with Him in the honour of His glory, and had then been dismissed
as having fully discharged their duty and office, for the express purpose of affirming for
Marcion’s information the fact that Moses and Elias had a share in even the glory of Christ.
But we have the entire structure4363 of this same vision in Habakkuk also, where the Spirit
in the person of some4364 of the apostles says, “O Lord, I have heard Thy speech, and was
afraid.” What speech was this, other than the words of the voice from heaven, This is my
beloved Son, hear ye Him? “I considered thy works, and was astonished.” When could this
have better happened than when Peter, on seeing His glory, knew not what he was saying?
“In the midst of the two Thou shalt be known”—even Moses and Elias.4365 These likewise
did Zechariah see under the figure of the two olive trees and olive branches.4366 For these
are they of whom he says, “They are the two anointed ones, that stand by the Lord of the
whole earth.” And again Habakkuk says, “His glory covered the heavens” (that is, with that
cloud), “and His splendour shall be like the light—even the light, wherewith His very raiment
glistened.” And if we would make mention of4367 the promise to Moses, we shall find it accomplished
here. For when Moses desired to see the Lord, saying, “If therefore I have found
grace in Thy sight, manifest Thyself to me, that I may see Thee distinctly,”4368 the sight
which he desired to have was of that condition which he was to assume as man, and which
as a prophet he knew was to occur. Respecting the face of God, however, he had already
heard, “No man shall see me, and live.” “This thing,” said He, “which thou hast spoken, will
I do unto thee.” Then Moses said, “Show me Thy glory.” And the Lord, with like reference
to the future, replied, “I will pass before thee in my glory,” etc. Then at the last He says,
“And then thou shalt see my back.”4369 Not loins, or calves of the legs, did he want to behold,
but the glory which was to be revealed in the latter days.4370 He had promised that He would
make Himself thus face to face visible to him, when He said to Aaron, “If there shall be a
prophet among you, I will make myself known to him by vision, and by vision will I speak
with him; but not so is my manner to Moses; with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even
apparently” (that is to say, in the form of man which He was to assume), “and not in dark

speeches.”4371 Now, although Marcion has denied4372 that he is here represented as speaking
with the Lord, but only as standing, yet, inasmuch as he stood “mouth to mouth,” he must
also have stood “face to face” with him, to use his words,4373 not far from him, in His very

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Impossible that Marcion’s Christ Should Reprove the Faithless
Generation. Such Loving Consideration for Infants as the True Christ Was Apt
to Shew, Also Impossible for the Other. On the Three Different Characters
Confronted and Instructed by Christ in Samaria.</head>
<p>I take on myself the character4375 of Israel. Let Marcion’s Christ stand forth, and exclaim,
“O faithless generation!4376 how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you?”4377
He will immediately have to submit to this remonstrance from me: “Whoever you are, O
stranger,4378 first tell us who you are, from whom you come, and what right you have over
us. Thus far, all you possess4379 belongs to the Creator. Of course, if you come from Him,
and are acting for Him, we will bear your reproof. But if you come from some other god, I
should wish you to tell us what you have ever committed to us belonging to yourself,4380
which it was our duty to believe, seeing that you are upbraiding us with ‘faithlessness,’ who
have never yet revealed to us your own self. How long ago4381 did you begin to treat with
us, that you should be complaining of the delay? On what points have you borne with us,
that you should adduce4382 your patience? Like Æsop’s ass, you are just come from the
well,4383 and are filling every place with your braying.” I assume, besides,4384 the person
of the disciple, against whom he has inveighed:4385 “O perverse nation! how long shall I be
with you? how long shall I suffer you?” This outburst of his I might, of course, retort upon
him most justly in such words as these: “Whoever you are, O stranger, first tell us who you
are, from whom you come, what right you have over us. Thus far, I suppose, you belong to
the Creator, and so we have followed you, recognising in you all things which are His. Now,
if you come from Him, we will bear your reproof. If, however, you are acting for another,
prythee tell us what you have ever conferred upon us that is simply your own, which it had
become our duty to believe, seeing that you reproach us with ‘faithlessness,’ although up to
this moment you show us no credentials. How long since did you begin to plead with us,

that you are charging us with delay? Wherein have you borne with us, that you should even
boast of your patience? The ass has only just arrived from Æsop’s well, and he is already
braying.” Now who would not thus have rebutted the unfairness of the rebuke, if he had
supposed its author to belong to him who had had no right as yet to complain? Except that
not even He4386 would have inveighed against them, if He had not dwelt among them of
old in the law and by the prophets, and with mighty deeds and many mercies, and had always
experienced them to be “faithless.” But, behold, Christ takes4387 infants, and teaches how
all ought to be like them, if they ever wish to be greater.4388 The Creator, on the contrary,4389
let loose bears against children, in order to avenge His prophet Elisha, who had been mocked
by them.4390 This antithesis is impudent enough, since it throws together4391 things so
different as infants4392 and children,4393—an age still innocent, and one already capable of
discretion—able to mock, if not to blaspheme. As therefore God is a just God, He spared
not impious children, exacting as He does honour for every time of life, and especially, of
course, from youth. And as God is good, He so loves infants as to have blessed the midwives
in Egypt, when they protected the infants of the Hebrews4394 which were in peril from
Pharaoh’s command.4395 Christ therefore shares this kindness with the Creator. As indeed
for Marcion’s god, who is an enemy to marriage, how can he possibly seem to be a lover of
little children, which are simply the issue of marriage? He who hates the seed must needs
also detest the fruit. Yea, he ought to be deemed more ruthless than the king of Egypt.4396
For whereas Pharaoh forbade infants to be brought up, he will not allow them even to be
born, depriving them of their ten months’ existence in the womb. And how much more
credible it is, that kindness to little children should be attributed to Him who blessed matrimony
for the procreation of mankind, and in such benediction included also the promise
of connubial fruit itself, the first of which is that of infancy!4397 The Creator, at the request
of Elias, inflicts the blow4398 of fire from heaven in the case of that false prophet (of

Baalzebub).4399 I recognise herein the severity of the Judge. And I, on the contrary, the
severe rebuke4400 of Christ on His disciples, when they were for inflicting4401 a like visitation
on that obscure village of the Samaritans.4402 The heretic, too, may discover that this gentleness
of Christ was promised by the selfsame severest Judge. “He shall not contend,” says
He, “nor shall His voice be heard in the street; a bruised reed shall He not crush, and smoking
flax shall He not quench.”4403 Being of such a character, He was of course much the less
disposed to burn men. For even at that time the Lord said to Elias,4404 “He was not in the
fire, but in the still small voice.”4405 Well, but why does this most humane and merciful
God reject the man who offers himself to Him as an inseparable companion?4406 If it were
from pride or from hypocrisy that he had said, “I will follow Thee whithersoever Thou
goest,’ then, by judicially reproving an act of either pride or hypocrisy as worthy of rejection,
He performed the office of a Judge. And, of course, him whom He rejected He condemned
to the loss of not following the Saviour.4407 For as He calls to salvation him whom He does
not reject, or him whom He voluntarily invites, so does He consign to perdition him whom
He rejects. When, however, He answers the man, who alleged as an excuse his father’s
burial, “Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the kingdom of God,”4408 He
gave a clear confirmation to those two laws of the Creator—that in Leviticus, which concerns
the sacerdotal office, and forbids the priests to be present at the funerals even of their parents.
“The priest,” says He, “shall not enter where there is any dead person;4409 and for his father
he shall not be defiled”4410; as well as that in Numbers, which relates to the (Nazarite) vow
of separation; for there he who devotes himself to God, among other things, is bidden “not
to come at any dead body,” not even of his father, or his mother, or his brother.4411 Now it

had been inspiring4412 to preach the kingdom of God. Or else, if it be not so, he must be
pronounced impious enough who, without the intervention of any precept of the law,
commanded that burials of parents should be neglected by their sons. When, indeed, in the
third case before us, (Christ) forbids the man “to look back” who wanted first “to bid his
family farewell,” He only follows out the rule4413 of the Creator. For this (retrospection)

<head>Chapter XXIV.—On the Mission of the Seventy Disciples, and Christ’s Charge to
Them. Precedents Drawn from the Old Testament. Absurdity of Supposing
that Marcion’s Christ Could Have Given the Power of Treading on Serpents and
Scorpions.</head>
<p>He chose also seventy other missionaries4415 besides the twelve. Now why, if the twelve
followed the number of the twelve fountains of Elim,4416 should not the seventy correspond
to the like number of the palms of that place?4417 Whatever be the Antitheses of the comparison,
it is a diversity in the causes, not in the powers, which has mainly produced them. But
if one does not keep in view the diversity of the causes,4418 he is very apt to infer a difference
of powers.4419 When the children of Israel went out of Egypt, the Creator brought them
forth laden with their spoils of gold and silver vessels, and with loads besides of raiment and
unleavened dough;4420 whereas Christ commanded His disciples not to carry even a staff4421
for their journey. The former were thrust forth into a desert, but the latter were sent into
cities. Consider the difference presented in the occasions,4422 and you will understand how
it was one and the same power which arranged the mission4423 of His people according to
their poverty in the one case, and their plenty in the other. He cut down4424 their supplies
when they could be replenished through the cities, just as He had accumulated4425 them
when exposed to the scantiness of the desert. Even shoes He forbade them to carry. For it
was He under whose very protection the people wore not out a shoe,4426 even in the wilderness
for the space of so many years. “No one,” says He, “shall ye salute by the way.”4427
What a destroyer of the prophets, forsooth, is Christ, seeing it is from them that He received
his precept also! When Elisha sent on his servant Gehazi before him to raise the Shunammite’s
son from death, I rather think he gave him these instructions:4428 “Gird up thy loins, and

take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not;4429 and
if any salute thee, answer him not again.”4430 For what is a wayside blessing but a mutual
salutation as men meet? So also the Lord commands: “Into whatsoever house they enter,
let them say, Peace be to it.”4431 Herein He follows the very same example. For Elisha enjoined
upon his servant the same salutation when he met the Shunammite; he was to say to
her: “Peace to thine husband, peace to thy child.”4432 Such will be rather our Antitheses;
they compare Christ with, instead of sundering Him from, the Creator. “The labourer is
worthy of his hire.”4433 Who could better pronounce such a sentence than the Judge? For
to decide that the workman deserves his wages, is in itself a judicial act. There is no award
which consists not in a process of judgment. The law of the Creator on this point also
presents us with a corroboration, for He judges that labouring oxen are as labourers worthy
of their hire: “Thou shalt not muzzle,” says He, “the ox when he treadeth out the corn.”4434
Now, who is so good to man4435 as He who is also merciful to cattle? Now, when Christ
pronounced labourers to be worthy of their hire, He, in fact, exonerated from blame that
precept of the Creator about depriving the Egyptians of their gold and silver vessels.4436
For they who had built for the Egyptians their houses and cities, were surely workmen
worthy of their hire, and were not instructed in a fraudulent act, but only set to claim compensation
for their hire, which they were unable in any other way to exact from their masters.
4437 That the kingdom of God was neither new nor unheard of, He in this way affirmed,
whilst at the same time He bids them announce that it was near at hand.4438 Now it is that
which was once far off, which can be properly said to have become near. If, however, a thing
had never existed previous to its becoming near, it could never have been said to have approached,
because it had never existed at a distance. Everything which is new and unknown
is also sudden.4439 Everything which is sudden, then, first receives the accident of time4440
when it is announced, for it then first puts on appearance of form.4441 Besides it will be

impossible for a thing either to have been tardy4442 all the while it remained unannounced,
4443 or to have approached4444 from the time it shall begin to be announced.</p>
<p>He likewise adds, that they should say to such as would not receive them: “Notwithstanding
be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.”4445 If He does not
enjoin this by way of a commination, the injunction is a most useless one. For what mattered
it to them that the kingdom was at hand, unless its approach was accompanied with judgment?—
even for the salvation of such as received the announcement thereof. How, if there
can be a threat without its accomplishment, can you have in a threatening god, one that
executes also, and in both, one that is a judicial being?4446 So, again, He commands that the
dust be shaken off against them, as a testimony,—the very particles of their ground which
might cleave4447 to the sandal, not to mention4448 any other sort of communication with
them.4449 But if their churlishness4450 and inhospitality were to receive no vengeance from
Him, for what purpose does He premise a testimony, which surely forbodes some threats?
Furthermore, when the Creator also, in the book of Deuteronomy, forbids the reception of
the Ammonites and the Moabites into the church,4451 because, when His people came from
Egypt, they fraudulently withheld provisions from them with inhumanity and inhospitality,
4452 it will be manifest that the prohibition of intercourse descended to Christ from Him.
The form of it which He uses—“He that despiseth you, despiseth me”4453—the Creator had
also addressed to Moses: “Not against thee have they murmured, but against me.”4454
Moses, indeed, was as much an apostle as the apostles were prophets. The authority of both
offices will have to be equally divided, as it proceeds from one and the same Lord, (the God)
of apostles and prophets. Who is He that shall bestow “the power of treading on serpents
and scorpions?”4455 Shall it be He who is the Lord of all living creatures or he who is not

god over a single lizard? Happily the Creator has promised by Isaiah to give this power even
to little children, of putting their hand in the cockatrice den and on the hole of the young
asps without at all receiving hurt.4456 And, indeed, we are aware (without doing violence
to the literal sense of the passage, since even these noxious animals have actually been unable
to do hurt where there has been faith) that under the figure of scorpions and serpents are
portended evil spirits, whose very prince is described4457 by the name of serpent, dragon,
and every other most conspicuous beast in the power of the Creator.4458 This power the
Creator conferred first of all upon His Christ, even as the ninetieth Psalm says to Him:
“Upon the asp and the basilisk shalt Thou tread; the lion and the dragon shalt Thou trample
under foot.”4459 So also Isaiah: “In that day the Lord God shall draw His sacred, great, and
strong sword” (even His Christ) “against that dragon, that great and tortuous serpent; and
He shall slay him in that day.”4460 But when the same prophet says, “The way shall be called
a clean and holy way; over it the unclean thing shall not pass, nor shall be there any unclean
way; but the dispersed shall pass over it, and they shall not err therein; no lion shall be there,
nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon; it shall not be found there,”4461 he points out
the way of faith, by which we shall reach to God; and then to this way of faith he promises
this utter crippling4462 and subjugation of all noxious animals. Lastly, you may discover
the suitable times of the promise, if you read what precedes the passage: “Be strong, ye weak
hands and ye feeble knees: then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the
deaf shall hear; then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall
be articulate.”4463 When, therefore, He proclaimed the benefits of His cures, then also did
He put the scorpions and the serpents under the feet of His saints—even He who had first
received this power from the Father, in order to bestow it upon others and then manifested
it forth conformably to the order of prophecy.4464</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—Christ Thanks the Father for Revealing to Babes What He Had
Concealed from the Wise. This Concealment Judiciously Effected by the Creator.
Other Points in St. Luke’s Chap. X. Shown to Be Only Possible to the Creator’s
Christ.</head>
<p>Who shall be invoked as the Lord of heaven, that does not first show Himself4465 to
have been the maker thereof? For He says, “I thank thee, (O Father,) and own Thee, Lord
of heaven, because those things which had been hidden from the wise and prudent, Thou
has revealed unto babes.”4466 What things are these? And whose? And by whom hidden?
And by whom revealed? If it was by Marcion’s god that they were hidden and revealed, it
was an extremely iniquitous proceeding;4467 for nothing at all had he ever produced4468 in
which anything could have been hidden—no prophecies, no parables, no visions, no evidences4469
of things, or words, or names, obscured by allegories and figures, or cloudy enigmas,
but he had concealed the greatness even of himself, which he was with all his might revealing
by his Christ. Now in what respect had the wise and prudent done wrong,4470 that God
should be hidden from them, when their wisdom and prudence had been insufficient to
come to the knowledge of Him? No way had been provided by himself,4471 by any declaration
of his works, or any vestiges whereby they might become4472 wise and prudent. However,
if they had even failed in any duty towards a god whom they knew not, suppose him now
at last to be known still they ought not to have found a jealous god in him who is introduced
as unlike the Creator. Therefore, since he had neither provided any materials in which he
could have hidden anything, nor had any offenders from whom he could have hidden
himself: since, again, even if he had had any, he ought not to have hidden himself from
them, he will not now be himself the revealer, who was not previously the concealer; so
neither will any be the Lord of heaven nor the Father of Christ but He in whom all these
attributes consistently meet.4473 For He conceals by His preparatory apparatus of prophetic
obscurity, the understanding of which is open to faith (for “if ye will not believe, ye shall
not understand”4474); and He had offenders in those wise and prudent ones who would not

seek after God, although He was to be discovered in His so many and mighty works,4475 or
who rashly philosophized about Him, and thereby furnished to heretics their arts;4476 and
lastly, He is a jealous God. Accordingly,4477 that which Christ thanks God for doing, He
long ago4478 announced by Isaiah: “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding
of the prudent will I hide.”4479 So in another passage He intimates both that He
has concealed, and that He will also reveal: “I will give unto them treasures that have been
hidden, and secret ones will I discover to them.”4480 And again: “Who else shall scatter the
tokens of ventriloquists,4481 and the devices of those who divine out of their own heart;
turning wise men backward, and making their counsels foolish?”4482 Now, if He has designated
His Christ as an enlightener of the Gentiles, saying, “I have set thee for a light of the
Gentiles;”4483 and if we understand these to be meant in the word babes4484—as having
been once dwarfs in knowledge and infants in prudence, and even now also babes in their
lowliness of faith—we shall of course more easily understand how He who had once hidden
“these things,” and promised a revelation of them through Christ, was the same God as He
who had now revealed them unto babes. Else, if it was Marcion’s god who revealed the things
which had been formerly hidden by the Creator, it follows4485 that he did the Creator’s
work by setting forth His deeds.4486 But he did it, say you, for His destruction, that he might
refute them.4487 Therefore he ought to have refuted them to those from whom the Creator
had hidden them, even the wise and prudent. For if he had a kind intention in what he did,
the gift of knowledge was due to those from whom the Creator had detained it, instead of
the babes, to whom the Creator had grudged no gift. But after all, it is, I presume, the edifica

tion4488 rather than the demolition4489 of the law and the prophets which we have thus far
found effected in Christ. “All things,” He says, “are delivered unto me of my Father.”4490
You may believe Him, if He is the Christ of the Creator to whom all things belong; because
the Creator has not delivered to a Son who is less than Himself all things, which He created
by4491 Him, that is to say, by His Word. If, on the contrary, he is the notorious stranger,4492
what are the “all things” which have been delivered to him by the Father? Are they the Creator’s?
Then the things which the Father delivered to the Son are good, and the Creator is
therefore good, since all His “things” are good; whereas he4493 is no longer good who has
invaded another’s good (domains) to deliver it to his son, thus teaching robbery4494 of another’s
goods. Surely he must be a most mendacious being, who had no other means of enriching
his son than by helping himself to another’s property! Or else,4495 if nothing of the
Creator’s has been delivered to him by the Father, by what right4496 does he claim for himself
(authority over) man? Or again, if man has been delivered to him, and man alone, then
man is not “all things.” But Scripture clearly says that a transfer of all things has been made
to the Son. If, however, you should interpret this “all” of the whole human race, that is, all
nations, then the delivery of even these to the Son is within the purpose of the Creator:4497
“I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for
Thy possession.”4498 If, indeed, he has some things of his own, the whole of which he might
give to his son, along with the man of the Creator, then show some one thing of them all,
as a sample, that I may believe; lest I should have as much reason not to believe that all
things belong to him, of whom I see nothing, as I have ground for believing that even the
things which I see not are His, to whom belongs the universe, which I see. But “no man
knoweth who the Father is, but the Son; and who the Son is, but the Father, and he to whom
the Son will reveal Him.”4499 And so it was an unknown god that Christ preached! And
other heretics, too, prop themselves up by this passage; alleging in opposition to it that the

Creator was known to all, both to Israel by familiar intercourse, and to the Gentiles by
nature. Well, how is it He Himself testifies that He was not known to Israel? “But Israel
doth not know me, and my people doth not consider me;”4500 nor to the Gentiles: “For,
behold,” says He, “of the nations I have no man.”4501 Therefore He reckoned them “as the
drop of a bucket,”4502 while “Sion He left as a look-out4503 in a vineyard.”4504 See, then,
whether there be not here a confirmation of the prophet’s word, when he rebukes that ignorance
of man toward God which continued to the days of the Son of man. For it was on
this account that he inserted the clause that the Father is known by him to whom the Son
has revealed Him, because it was even He who was announced as set by the Father to be a
light to the Gentiles, who of course required to be enlightened concerning God, as well as
to Israel, even by imparting to it a fuller knowledge of God. Arguments, therefore, will be
of no use for belief in the rival god which may be suitable4505 for the Creator, because it is
only such as are unfit for the Creator which will be able to advance belief in His rival. If
you look also into the next words, “Blessed are the eyes which see the things which ye see,
for I tell you that prophets have not seen the things which ye see,”4506 you will find that
they follow from the sense above, that no man indeed had come to the knowledge of God
as he ought to have done,4507 since even the prophets had not seen the things which were
being seen under Christ. Now if He had not been my Christ, He would not have made any
mention of the prophets in this passage. For what was there to wonder at, if they had not
seen the things of a god who had been unknown to them, and was only revealed a long time
after them? What blessedness, however, could theirs have been, who were then seeing what
others were naturally4508 unable to see, since it was of things which they had never predicted
that they had not obtained the sight;4509 if it were not because they might justly4510 have
seen the things pertaining to their God, which they had even predicted, but which they at
the same time4511 had not seen? This, however, will be the blessedness of others, even of

such as were seeing the things which others had only foretold. We shall by and by show,
nay, we have already shown, that in Christ those things were seen which had been foretold,
but yet had been hidden from the very prophets who foretold them, in order that they might
be hidden also from the wise and the prudent. In the true Gospel, a certain doctor of the
law comes to the Lord and asks, “What shall I do to inherit eternal life?” In the heretical
gospel life only is mentioned, without the attribute eternal; so that the lawyer seems to have
consulted Christ simply about the life which the Creator in the law promises to prolong,4512
and the Lord to have therefore answered him according to the law, “Thou shalt love the
Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength,”4513 since
the question was concerning the conditions of mere life. But the lawyer of course knew very
well in what way the life which the law meant4514 was to be obtained, so that his question
could have had no relation to the life whose rules he was himself in the habit of teaching.
But seeing that even the dead were now raised by Christ, and being himself excited to the
hope of an eternal life by these examples of a restored4515 one, he would lose no more time
in merely looking on (at the wonderful things which had made him) so high in hope.4516
He therefore consulted him about the attainment of eternal life. Accordingly, the Lord, being
Himself the same,4517 and introducing no new precept other than that which relates above
all others4518 to (man’s) entire salvation, even including the present and the future life,4519
places before him4520 the very essence4521 of the law—that he should in every possible way
love the Lord his God. If, indeed, it were only about a lengthened life, such as is at the Creator’s
disposal, that he inquired and Christ answered, and not about the eternal life, which
is at the disposal of Marcion’s god, how is he to obtain the eternal one? Surely not in the
same manner as the prolonged life. For in proportion to the difference of the reward must
be supposed to be also the diversity of the services. Therefore your disciple, Marcion,4522
will not obtain his eternal life in consequence of loving your God, in the same way as the
man who loves the Creator will secure the lengthened life. But how happens it that, if He is

to be loved who promises the prolonged life, He is not much more to be loved who offers
the eternal life? Therefore both one and the other life will be at the disposal of one and the
same Lord; because one and the same discipline is to be followed4523 for one and the other
life. What the Creator teaches to be loved, that must He necessarily maintain4524 also by
Christ,4525 for that rule holds good here, which prescribes that greater things ought to be
believed of Him who has first lesser proofs to show, than of him for whom no preceding
smaller presumptions have secured a claim to be believed in things of higher import. It
matters not4526 then, whether the word eternal has been interpolated by us.4527 It is enough
for me, that the Christ who invited men to the eternal—not the lengthened—life, when
consulted about the temporal life which he was destroying, did not choose to exhort the
man rather to that eternal life which he was introducing. Pray, what would the Creator’s
Christ have done, if He who had made man for loving the Creator did not belong to the
Creator? I suppose He would have said that the Creator was not to be loved!</p>

Comes from the Creator. The Lord’s Prayer and Other Words of Christ. The
Dumb Spirit and Christ’s Discourse on Occasion of the Expulsion. The Exclamation
of the Woman in the Crowd.</head>
<p>When in a certain place he had been praying to that Father above,4528 looking up with
insolent and audacious eyes to the heaven of the Creator, by whom in His rough and cruel
nature he might have been crushed with hail and lightning—just as it was by Him contrived
that he was (afterwards) attached to a cross4529 at Jerusalem—one of his disciples came to
him and said, “Master, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.” This he said,
forsooth, because he thought that different prayers were required for different gods! Now,
he who had advanced such a conjecture as this should first show that another god had been
proclaimed by Christ. For nobody would have wanted to know how to pray, before he had
learned whom he was to pray to. If, however, he had already learned this, prove it. If you
find nowhere any proof, let me tell you4530 that it was to the Creator that he asked for instruction
in prayer, to whom John’s disciples also used to pray. But, inasmuch as John had
introduced some new order of prayer, this disciple had not improperly presumed to think
that he ought also to ask of Christ whether they too must not (according to some special
rule of their Master) pray, not indeed to another god, but in another manner. Christ accordingly4531
would not have taught His disciple prayer before He had given him the knowledge
of God Himself. Therefore what He actually taught was prayer to Him whom the disciple
had already known. In short, you may discover in the import4532 of the prayer what God is
addressed therein. To whom can I say, “Father?”4533 To him who had nothing to do with
making me, from whom I do not derive my origin? Or to Him, who, by making and fashioning
me, became my parent?4534 Of whom can I ask for His Holy Spirit? Of him who
gives not even the mundane spirit;4535 or of Him “who maketh His angels spirits,” and
whose Spirit it was which in the beginning hovered upon the waters.4536 Whose kingdom
shall I wish to come—his, of whom I never heard as the king of glory; or His, in whose hand

are even the hearts of kings? Who shall give me my daily4537 bread? Shall it be he who produces
for me not a grain of millet-seed;4538 or He who even from heaven gave to His people
day by day the bread of angels?4539 Who shall forgive me my trespasses?4540 He who, by
refusing to judge them, does not retain them; or He who, unless He forgives them, will retain
them, even to His judgment? Who shall suffer us not to be led into temptation? He before
whom the tempter will never be able to tremble; or He who from the beginning has beforehand
condemned4541 the angel tempter? If any one, with such a form,4542 invokes another
god and not the Creator, he does not pray; he only blasphemes.4543 In like manner, from
whom must I ask that I may receive? Of whom seek, that I may find? To whom knock, that
it may be opened to me?4544 Who has to give to him that asks, but He to whom all things
belong, and whose am I also that am the asker? What, however, have I lost before that other
god, that I should seek of him and find it. If it be wisdom and prudence, it is the Creator
who has hidden them. Shall I resort to him, then, in quest of them? If it be health4545 and
life, they are at the disposal of the Creator. Nor must anything be sought and found anywhere
else than there, where it is kept in secret that it may come to light. So, again, at no other
door will I knock than at that out of which my privilege has reached me.4546 In fine, if to
receive, and to find, and to be admitted, is the fruit of labour and earnestness to him who
has asked, and sought, and knocked, understand that these duties have been enjoined, and
results promised, by the Creator. As for that most excellent god of yours, coming as he
professes gratuitously to help man, who was not his (creature),4547 he could not have imposed
upon him any labour, or (endowed him with) any earnestness. For he would by this time
cease to be the most excellent god, were he not spontaneously to give to every one who does
not ask, and permit every one who seeks not to find, and open to every one who does not
knock. The Creator, on the contrary,4548 was able to proclaim these duties and rewards by

Christ, in order that man, who by sinning had offended his God, might toil on (in his probation),
and by his perseverance in asking might receive, and in seeking might find, and in
knocking might enter. Accordingly, the preceding similitude4549 represents the man who
went at night and begged for the loaves, in the light of a friend and not a stranger, and makes
him knock at a friend’s house and not at a stranger’s. But even if he has offended, man is
more of a friend with the Creator than with the god of Marcion. At His door, therefore,
does he knock to whom he had the right of access; whose gate he had found; whom he knew
to possess bread; in bed now with His children, whom He had willed to be born.4550 Even
though the knocking is late in the day, it is yet the Creator’s time. To Him belongs the latest
hour who owns an entire age4551 and the end thereof. As for the new god, however, no one
could have knocked at his door late, for he has hardly yet4552 seen the light of morning. It
is the Creator, who once shut the door to the Gentiles, which was then knocked at by the
Jews, that both rises and gives, if not now to man as a friend, yet not as a stranger, but, as
He says, “because of his importunity.”4553 Importunate, however, the recent god could not
have permitted any one to be in the short time (since his appearance).4554 Him, therefore,
whom you call the Creator recognise also as “Father.” It is even He who knows what His
children require. For when they asked for bread, He gave them manna from heaven; and
when they wanted flesh, He sent them abundance of quails—not a serpent for a fish, nor
for an egg a scorpion.4555 It will, however, appertain to Him not to give evil instead of good,
who has both one and the other in His power. Marcion’s god, on the contrary, not having
a scorpion, was unable to refuse to give what he did not possess; only He (could do so), who,
having a scorpion, yet gives it not. In like manner, it is He who will give the Holy Spirit, at
whose command4556 is also the unholy spirit. When He cast out the “demon which was
dumb”4557 (and by a cure of this sort verified Isaiah),4558 and having been charged with
casting out demons by Beelzebub, He said, “If I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom
do your sons cast them out?”4559 By such a question what does He otherwise mean, than

that He ejects the spirits by the same power by which their sons also did—that is, by the
power of the Creator? For if you suppose the meaning to be, “If I by Beelzebub, etc., by
whom your sons?”—as if He would reproach them with having the power of Beelzebub,—you
are met at once by the preceding sentence, that “Satan cannot be divided against himself.”4560
So that it was not by Beelzebub that even they were casting out demons, but (as we have
said) by the power of the Creator; and that He might make this understood, He adds: “But
if I with the finger of God cast out demons, is not the kingdom of God come near unto
you?”4561 For the magicians who stood before Pharaoh and resisted Moses called the power
of the Creator “the finger of God.”4562 It was the finger of God, because it was a sign4563 that
even a thing of weakness was yet abundant in strength. This Christ also showed, when, recalling
to notice (and not obliterating) those ancient wonders which were really His own,4564
He said that the power of God must be understood to be the finger of none other God than
Him, under4565 whom it had received this appellation. His kingdom, therefore, was come
near to them, whose power was called His “finger.” Well, therefore, did He connect4566
with the parable of “the strong man armed,” whom “a stronger man still overcame,”4567 the
prince of the demons, whom He had already called Beelzebub and Satan; signifying that it
was he who was overcome by the finger of God, and not that the Creator had been subdued
by another god. Besides,4568 how could His kingdom be still standing, with its boundaries,
and laws, and functions, whom, even if the whole world were left entire to Him, Marcion’s
god could possibly seem to have overcome as “the stronger than He,” if it were not in consequence
of His law that even Marcionites were constantly dying, by returning in their dissolution4569
to the ground, and were so often admonished by even a scorpion, that the
Creator had by no means been overcome?4570 “A (certain) mother of the company exclaims,

of Their Love of Outward Show Rather Than Inward Holiness. Scripture Abounds
with Admonitions of a Similar Purport. Proofs of His Mission from the Creator.</head>
<p>I prefer elsewhere refuting4575 the faults which the Marcionites find in the Creator. It
is here enough that they are also found in Christ.4576 Behold how unequal, inconsistent,
and capricious he is! Teaching one thing and doing another, he enjoins “giving to every one
that seeks;” and yet he himself refuses to give to those “who seek a sign.”4577 For a vast age
he hides his own light from men, and yet says that a candle must not be hidden, but affirms
that it ought to be set upon a candlestick, that it may give light to all.4578 He forbids cursing
again, and cursing much more of course; and yet he heaps his woe upon the Pharisees and
doctors of the law.4579 Who so closely resembles my God as His own Christ? We have often
already laid it down for certain,4580 that He could not have been branded4581 as the destroyer
of the law if He had promulged another god. Therefore even the Pharisee, who invited Him
to dinner in the passage before us,4582 expressed some surprise4583 in His presence that He
had not washed before He sat down to meat, in accordance with the law, since it was the
God of the law that He was proclaiming.4584 Jesus also interpreted the law to him when He
told him that they “made clean the outside of the cup and the platter, whereas their inward
part was full of ravening and wickedness.” This He said, to signify that by the cleansing of
vessels was to be understood before God the purification of men, inasmuch as it was about
a man, and not about an unwashed vessel, that even this Pharisee had been treating in His
presence. He therefore said: “You wash the outside of the cup,” that is, the flesh, “but you
do not cleanse your inside part,”4585 that is, the soul; adding: “Did not He that made the
outside,” that is, the flesh, “also make the inward part,” that is to say, the soul?—by which
assertion He expressly declared that to the same God belongs the cleansing of a man’s external
and internal nature, both alike being in the power of Him who prefers mercy not only

have enjoined mercy, he could not have done so previous to his becoming known. Furthermore,
it is in this passage evident that they4589 were not reproved concerning their God,
but concerning a point of His instruction to them, when He prescribed to them figuratively
the cleansing of their vessels, but really the works of merciful dispositions. In like manner,
He upbraids them for tithing paltry herbs,4590 but at the same time “passing over hospitality4591
and the love of God.”4592 The vocation and the love of what God, but Him by whose
law of tithes they used to offer their rue and mint? For the whole point of the rebuke lay in
this, that they cared about small matters in His service of course, to whom they failed to
exhibit their weightier duties when He commanded them: “Thou shalt love with all thine
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, the Lord thy God, who hath called
thee out of Egypt.”4593 Besides, time enough had not yet passed to admit of Christ’s requiring
so premature—nay, as yet so distasteful4594—a love towards a new and recent, not to say a
hardly yet developed,4595 deity. When, again, He upbraids those who caught at the uppermost
places and the honour of public salutations, He only follows out the Creator’s course,4596
who calls ambitious persons of this character “rulers of Sodom,”4597 who forbids us “to put
confidence even in princes,”4598 and pronounces him to be altogether wretched who places
his confidence in man. But whoever4599 aims at high position, because he would glory in

such attentions (in the shape) of placing hope and confidence in man, He at the same time4601
censured all who were ambitious of high positions. He also inveighs against the doctors of
the law themselves, because they were “lading men with burdens grievous to be borne, which
they did not venture to touch with even a finger of their own;”4602 but not as if He made a
mock of4603 the burdens of the law with any feeling of detestation towards it. For how could
He have felt aversion to the law, who used with so much earnestness to upbraid them for
passing over its weightier matters, alms—giving, hospitality,4604 and the love of God? Nor,
indeed, was it only these great things (which He recognized), but even4605 the tithes of rue
and the cleansing of cups. But, in truth, He would rather have deemed them excusable for
being unable to carry burdens which could not be borne. What, then, are the burdens which
He censures?4606 None but those which they were accumulating of their own accord, when
they taught for commandments the doctrines of men; for the sake of private advantage
joining house to house, so as to deprive their neighbour of his own; cajoling4607 the people,
loving gifts, pursuing rewards, robbing the poor of the rights of judgment, that they might
have the widow for a prey and the fatherless for a spoil.4608 Of these Isaiah also says, “Woe
unto them that are strong in Jerusalem!”4609 and again, “They that demand you shall rule
over you.”4610 And who did this more than the lawyers?4611 Now, if these offended Christ,
it was as belonging to Him that they offended Him. He would have aimed no blow at the
teachers of an alien law. But why is a “woe” pronounced against them for “building the
sepulchres of the prophets whom their fathers had killed?”4612 They rather deserved praise,
because by such an act of piety they seemed to show that they did not allow the deeds of
their fathers. Was it not because (Christ) was jealous4613 of such a disposition as the Marcionites
denounce,4614 visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the fourth

generation? What “key,” indeed, was it which these lawyers had,4615 but the interpretation
of the law? Into the perception of this they neither entered themselves, even because they
did not believe (for “unless ye believe, ye shall not understand”); nor did they permit others
to enter, because they preferred to teach them for commandments even the doctrines of
men. When, therefore, He reproached those who did not themselves enter in, and also shut
the door against others, must He be regarded as a disparager of the law, or as a supporter
of it? If a disparager, those who were hindering the law ought to have been pleased; if a
supporter, He is no longer an enemy of the law.4616 But all these imprecations He uttered
in order to tarnish the Creator as a cruel Being,4617 against whom such as offended were
destined to have a “woe.” And who would not rather have feared to provoke a cruel Being,4618
by withdrawing allegiance4619 from Him? Therefore the more He represented the Creator
to be an object of fear, the more earnestly would He teach that He ought to be served. Thus
would it behove the Creator’s Christ to act.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVIII.—Examples from the Old Testament, Balaam, Moses, and Hezekiah,
to Show How Completely the Instruction and Conduct of Christ4620 Are in
Keeping with the Will and Purpose of the Creator.</head>
<p>Justly, therefore, was the hypocrisy of the Pharisees displeasing to Him, loving God as
they did with their lips, but not with their heart. “Beware,” He says to the disciples, “of the
leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy,” not the proclamation of the Creator. The Son
hates those who refused obedience4621 to the Father; nor does He wish His disciples to show
such a disposition towards Him—not (let it be observed) towards another god, against whom
such hypocrisy indeed might have been admissible, as that which He wished to guard His
disciples against. It is the example of the Pharisees which He forbids. It was in respect of
Him against whom the Pharisees were sinning that (Christ) now forbade His disciples to
offend. Since, then, He had censured their hypocrisy, which covered the secrets of the heart,
and obscured with superficial offices the mysteries of unbelief, because (while holding the
key of knowledge) it would neither enter in itself, nor permit others to enter in, He therefore
adds, “There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; neither hid, which shall not be
known,”4622 in order that no one should suppose that He was attempting the revelation and
the recognition of an hitherto unknown and hidden god. When He remarks also on their
murmurs and taunts, in saying of Him, “This man casteth out devils only through Beelzebub,”
He means that all these imputations would come forth to the light of day, and be in the
mouths of men in consequence of the promulgation of the Gospel. He then turns to His
disciples with these words, “I say unto you, my friends, Be not afraid of them which can
only kill the body, and after that have no more power over you.”4623 They will, however,
find Isaiah had already said, “See how the just man is taken away, and no man layeth it to
heart.”4624 “But I will show you whom ye shall fear: fear Him who, after He hath killed, hath
power to cast into hell” (meaning, of course, the Creator); “yea, I say unto you, fear Him.”4625
Now, it would here be enough for my purpose that He forbids offence being given to Him
whom He orders to be feared; and that He orders Him to be respected4626 whom He forbids
to be offended; and that He who gives these commands belongs to that very God for whom
He procures this fear, this absence of offence, and this respect. But this conclusion I can

draw also from the following words: “For I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before
men, him will I also confess before God.”4627 Now they who shall confess Christ will have
to be slain4628 before men, but they will have nothing more to suffer after they have been
put to death by them. These therefore will be they whom He forewarns above not to be
afraid of being only killed; and this forewarning He offers, in order that He might subjoin
a clause on the necessity of confessing Him: “Every one that denieth me before men shall
be denied before God”4629—by Him, of course, who would have confessed him, if he had
only confessed God. Now, He who will confess the confessor is the very same God who will
also deny the denier of Himself. Again, if it is the confessor who will have nothing to fear
after his violent death,4630 it is the denier to whom everything will become fearful after his
natural death. Since, therefore, that which will have to be feared after death, even the punishment
of hell, belongs to the Creator, the denier, too, belongs to the Creator. As with the
denier, however, so with the confessor: if he should deny God, he will plainly have to suffer
from God, although from men he had nothing more to suffer after they had put him to
death. And so Christ is the Creator’s, because He shows that all those who deny Him ought
to fear the Creator’s hell. After deterring His disciples from denial of Himself, He adds an
admonition to fear blasphemy: “Whosoever shall speak against the Son of man, it shall be
forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven
him.”4631 Now, if both the remission and the retention of sin savour of a judicial God, the
Holy Ghost, who is not to be blasphemed, will belong to Him, who will not forgive the
blasphemy; just as He who, in the preceding passage, was not to be denied, belonged to,
Him who would, after He had killed, also cast into hell. Now, since it is Christ who averts
blasphemy from the Creator, I am at a loss to know in what manner His adversary4632 could
have come. Else, if by these sayings He throws a black cloud of censure4633 over the severity
of Him who will not forgive blasphemy and will kill even to hell, it follows that the very
spirit of that rival god may be blasphemed with impunity, and his Christ denied; and that
there is no difference, in fact, between worshipping and despising him; but that, as there is
no punishment for the contempt, so there is no reward for the worship, which men need
expect. When “brought before magistrates,” and examined, He forbids them “to take thought
how they shall answer;” “for,” says He, “the Holy Ghost shall teach you in that very hour

what ye ought to say.”4634 If such an injunction4635 as this comes from the Creator, the
precept will only be His by whom an example was previously given. The prophet Balaam,
in Numbers, when sent forth by king Balak to curse Israel, with whom he was commencing
war, was at the same moment4636 filled with the Spirit. Instead of the curse which he was
come to pronounce, he uttered the blessing which the Spirit at that very hour inspired him
with; having previously declared to the king’s messengers, and then to the king himself, that
he could only speak forth that which God should put into his mouth.4637 The novel doctrines
of the new Christ are such as the Creator’s servants initiated long before! But see how clear
a difference there is between the example of Moses and of Christ.4638 Moses voluntarily
interferes with brothers4639 who were quarrelling, and chides the offender: “Wherefore
smitest thou thy fellow?” He is, however, rejected by him: “Who made thee a prince or a
judge over us?”4640 Christ, on the contrary, when requested by a certain man to compose
a strife between him and his brother about dividing an inheritance, refused His assistance,
although in so honest a cause. Well, then, my Moses is better than your Christ, aiming as
he did at the peace of brethren, and obviating their wrong. But of course the case must be
different with Christ, for he is the Christ of the simply good and non-judicial god. “Who,”
says he, “made me a judge over you?”4641 No other word of excuse was he able to find,
without using4642 that with which the wicked, man and impious brother had rejected4643
the defender of probity and piety! In short, he approved of the excuse, although a bad one,
by his use of it; and of the act, although a bad one, by his refusal to make peace between
brothers. Or rather, would He not show His resentment4644 at the rejection of Moses with
such a word? And therefore did He not wish in a similar case of contentious brothers, to
confound them with the recollection of so harsh a word? Clearly so. For He had Himself
been present in Moses, who heard such a rejection—even He, the Spirit of the Creator.4645

I think that we have already, in another passage,4646 sufficiently shown that the glory of
riches is condemned by our God, “who putteth down the mighty from their throne, and
exalts the poor from the dunghill.”4647 From Him, therefore, will proceed the parable of
the rich man, who flattered himself about the increase of his fields, and to Whom God said:
“Thou fool, this night shall they require thy soul of thee; then whose shall those things be
which thou hast provided?”4648 It was just in the like manner that the king Hezekiah heard
from Isaiah the sad doom of his kingdom, when he gloried, before the envoys of Babylon,4649

<p>Who would be unwilling that we should distress ourselves4651 about sustenance for our
life, or clothing for our body,4652 but He who has provided these things already for man;
and who, therefore, while distributing them to us, prohibits all anxiety respecting them as
an outrage4653 against his liberality?—who has adapted the nature of “life” itself to a condition
“better than meat,” and has fashioned the material of “the body,” so as to make it “more
than raiment;” whose “ravens, too, neither sow nor reap, nor gather into storehouses, and
are yet fed” by Himself; whose “lilies and grass also toil not, nor spin, and yet are clothed”
by Him; whose “Solomon, moreover, was transcendent in glory, and yet was not arrayed
like” the humble flower.4654 Besides, nothing can be more abrupt than that one God should
be distributing His bounty, while the other should bid us take no thought about (so kindly
a) distribution—and that, too, with the intention of derogating (from his liberality).
Whether, indeed, it is as depreciating the Creator that he does not wish such trifles to be
thought of, concerning which neither the crows nor the lilies labour, because, forsooth, they
come spontaneously to hand4655 by reason of their very worthlessness,4656 will appear a
little further on. Meanwhile, how is it that He chides them as being “of little faith?”4657
What faith? Does He mean that faith which they were as yet unable to manifest perfectly
in a god who has hardly yet revealed,4658 and whom they were in process of learning as well
as they could; or that faith which they for this express reason owed to the Creator, because
they believed that He was of His own will supplying these wants of the human race, and
therefore took no thought about them? Now, when He adds, “For all these things do the
nations of the world seek after,”4659 even by their not believing in God as the Creator and
Giver of all things, since He was unwilling that they should be like these nations, He therefore
upbraided them as being defective of faith in the same God, in whom He remarked that the

Gentiles were quite wanting in faith. When He further adds, “But your Father knoweth that
ye have need of these things,”4660 I would first ask, what Father Christ would have to be
here understood? If He points to their own Creator, He also affirms Him to be good, who
knows what His children have need of; but if He refers to that other god, how does he know
that food and raiment are necessary to man, seeing that he has made no such provision for
him? For if he had known the want, he would have made the provision. If, however, he
knows what things man has need of, and yet has failed to supply them, he is in the failure
guilty of either malignity or weakness. But when he confessed that these things are necessary
to man, he really affirmed that they are good. For nothing that is evil is necessary. So that
he will not be any longer a depreciator of the works and the indulgences of the Creator, that
I may here complete the answer4661 which I deferred giving above. Again, if it is another
god who has foreseen man’s wants, and is supplying them, how is it that Marcion’s Christ
himself promises them?4662 Is he liberal with another’s property?4663 “Seek ye,” says he,
“the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you”—by himself, of course.
But if by himself, what sort of being is he, who shall bestow the things of another? If by the
Creator, whose all things are, then who4664 is he that promises what belongs to another? If
these things are “additions” to the kingdom, they must be placed in the second rank;4665
and the second rank belongs to Him to whom the first also does; His are the food and
raiment, whose is the kingdom. Thus to the Creator belongs the entire promise, the full
reality4666 of its parables, the perfect equalization4667 of its similitudes; for these have respect
to none other than Him to whom they have a parity of relation in every point.4668 We are
servants because we have a Lord in our God. We ought “to have our loins girded:”4669 in
other words, we are to be free from the embarrassments of a perplexed and much occupied
life; “to have our lights burning,”4670 that is, our minds kindled by faith, and resplendent
with the works of truth. And thus “to wait for our Lord,”4671 that is, Christ. Whence “return-

ing?” If “from the wedding,” He is the Christ of the Creator, for the wedding is His. If He is
not the Creator’s, not even Marcion himself would have gone to the wedding, although invited,
for in his god he discovers one who hates the nuptial bed. The parable would therefore
have failed in the person of the Lord, if He were not a Being to whom a wedding is consistent.
In the next parable also he makes a flagrant mistake, when he assigns to the person of the
Creator that “thief, whose hour, if the father of the family had only known, he would not
have suffered his house to be broken through.”4672 How can the Creator wear in any way
the aspect of a thief, Lord as He is of all mankind? No one pilfers or plunders his own
property, but he4673 rather acts the part of one who swoops down on the things of another,
and alienates man from his Lord.4674 Again, when He indicates to us that the devil is “the
thief,” whose hour at the very beginning of the world, if man had known, he would never
have been broken in upon4675 by him, He warns us “to be ready,” for this reason, because
“we know not the hour when the Son of man shall come”4676—not as if He were Himself
the thief, but rather as being the judge of those who prepared not themselves, and used no
precaution against the thief. Since, then, He is the Son of man, I hold Him to be the Judge,
and in the Judge I claim4677 the Creator. If then in this passage he displays the Creator’s
Christ under the title “Son of man,” that he may give us some presage4678 of the thief, of
the period of whose coming we are ignorant, you still have it ruled above, that no one is the
thief of his own property; besides which, there is our principle also unimpaired4679—that
in as far as He insists on the Creator as an object of fear, in so far does He belong to the
Creator, and does the Creator’s work. When, therefore, Peter asked whether He had spoken
the parable “unto them, or even to all,”4680 He sets forth for them, and for all who should
bear rule in the churches, the similitude of stewards.4681 That steward who should treat his
fellow-servants well in his Lord’s absence, would on his return be set as ruler over all his
property; but he who should act otherwise should be severed, and have his portion with the
unbelievers, when his lord should return on the day when he looked not for him, at the hour
when he was not aware4682—even that Son of man, the Creator’s Christ, not a thief, but a

Judge. He accordingly, in this passage, either presents to us the Lord as a Judge, and instructs
us in His character,4683 or else as the simply good god; if the latter, he now also affirms his
judicial attribute, although the heretic refuses to admit it. For an attempt is made to modify
this sense when it is applied to his god,—as if it were an act of serenity and mildness simply
to sever the man off, and to assign him a portion with the unbelievers, under the idea that
he was not summoned (before the judge), but only returned to his own state! As if this very
process did not imply a judicial act! What folly! What will be the end of the severed ones?
Will it not be the forfeiture of salvation, since their separation will be from those who shall
attain salvation? What, again, will be the condition of the unbelievers? Will it not be damnation?
Else, if these severed and unfaithful ones shall have nothing to suffer, there will, on
the other hand, be nothing for the accepted and the believers to obtain. If, however, the accepted
and the believers shall attain salvation, it must needs be that the rejected and the
unbelieving should incur the opposite issue, even the loss of salvation. Now here is a judgment,
and He who holds it out before us belongs to the Creator. Whom else than the God
of retribution can I understand by Him who shall “beat His servants with stripes,” either
“few or many,” and shall exact from them what He had committed to them? Whom is it
suitable4684 for me to obey, but Him who remunerates? Your Christ proclaims, “I am come
to send fire on the earth.”4685 That4686 most lenient being, the lord who has no hell, not
long before had restrained his disciples from demanding fire on the churlish village.

best explain the quality of that fire which He mentioned, when He goes on to say, “Suppose
ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division.”4692 It is
written “a sword,”4693 but Marcion makes an emendation4694 of the word, just as if a division
were not the work of the sword. He, therefore, who refused to give peace, intended also the
fire of destruction. As is the combat, so is the burning. As is the sword, so is the flame.
Neither is suitable for its lord. He says at last, “The father shall be divided against the son,
and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against
the mother; the mother-in-law against the daughter-in-law, and the daughter-in-law against
the mother-in-law.”4695 Since this battle among the relatives4696 was sung by the prophet’s
trumpet in the very words, I fear that Micah4697 must have predicted it to Marcion’s Christ!
On this account He pronounced them “hypocrites,” because they could “discern the face of
the sky and the earth, but could not distinguish this time,”4698 when of course He ought to
have been recognised, fulfilling (as he was) all things which had been predicted concerning
them, and teaching them so. But then who could know the times of him of whom he had
no evidence to prove his existence? Justly also does He upbraid them for “not even of
themselves judging what is right.”4699 Of old does He command by Zechariah, “Execute
the judgment of truth and peace;”4700 by Jeremiah, “Execute judgment and righteousness;”
4701 by Isaiah, “Judge the fatherless, plead for the widow,”4702 charging it as a fault

<head>Chapter XXX.—Parables of the Mustard-Seed, and of the Leaven. Transition to the
Solemn Exclusion Which Will Ensue When the Master of the House Has Shut
the Door. This Judicial Exclusion Will Be Administered by Christ, Who is Shown
Thereby to Possess the Attribute of the Creator.</head>
<p>When the question was again raised concerning a cure performed on the Sabbath-day,
how did He discuss it: “Doth not each of you on the Sabbath loose his ass or his ox from
the stall, and lead him away to watering?”4709 When, therefore, He did a work according
to the condition prescribed by the law, He affirmed, instead of breaking, the law, which
commanded that no work should be done, except what might be done for any living being;
4710 and if for any one, then how much more for a human life? In the case of the parables,
it is allowed that I4711 everywhere require a congruity. “The kingdom of God,” says He, “is
like a grain of mustard-seed which a man took and cast into his garden.” Who must be understood
as meant by the man? Surely Christ, because (although Marcion’s) he was called
“the Son of man.” He received from the Father the seed of the kingdom, that is, the word
of the gospel, and sowed it in his garden—in the world, of course4712—in man at the present
day, for instance.4713 Now, whereas it is said, “in his garden,” but neither the world nor man
is his property, but the Creator’s, therefore He who sowed seed in His own ground is shown
to be the Creator. Else, if, to evade this snare,4714 they should choose to transfer the person
of the man from Christ to any person who receives the seed of the kingdom and sows it in
the garden of his own heart, not even this meaning4715 would suit any other than the Creator.
For how happens it, if the kingdom belong to the most lenient god, that it is closely followed
up by a fervent judgment, the severity of which brings weeping?4716 With regard, indeed,
to the following similitude, I have my fears lest it should somehow4717 presage the kingdom
of the rival god! For He compared it, not to the unleavened bread which the Creator is more
familiar with, but to leaven.4718 Now this is a capital conjecture for men who are begging
for arguments. I must, however, on my side, dispel one fond conceit by another,4719 and

contend with even leaven is suitable for the kingdom of the Creator, because after it comes
the oven, or, if you please,4720 the furnace of hell. How often has He already displayed
Himself as a Judge, and in the Judge the Creator? How often, indeed, has He repelled, and
in the repulse condemned? In the present passage, for instance, He says, “When once the
master of the house is risen up;”4721 but in what sense except that in which Isaiah said,
“When He ariseth to shake terribly the earth?”4722 “And hath shut to the door,” thereby
shutting out the wicked, of course; and when these knock, He will answer, “I know you not
whence ye are;” and when they recount how “they have eaten and drunk in His presence,”
He will further say to them, “Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.”4723 But where? Outside, no doubt, when they shall have
been excluded with the door shut on them by Him. There will therefore be punishment inflicted
by Him who excludes for punishment, when they shall behold the righteous entering
the kingdom of God, but themselves detained without. By whom detained outside? If by
the Creator, who shall be within receiving the righteous into the kingdom? The good God.
What, therefore, is the Creator about,4724 that He should detain outside for punishment
those whom His adversary shut out, when He ought rather to have kindly received them, if
they must come into His hands,4725 for the greater irritation of His rival? But when about
to exclude the wicked, he must, of course, either be aware that the Creator would detain
them for punishment, or not be aware. Consequently either the wicked will be detained by
the Creator against the will of the excluder, in which case he will be inferior to the Creator,
submitting to Him unwillingly; or else, if the process is carried out with his will, then he
himself has judicially determined its execution; and then he who is the very originator of
the Creator’s infamy, will not prove to be one whit better than the Creator. Now, if these
ideas be incompatible with reason—of one being supposed to punish, and the other to liberate—
then to one only power will appertain both the judgment and the kingdom and while
they both belong to one, He who executeth judgment can be none else than the Christ of
the Creator.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXI.—Christ’s Advice to Invite the Poor in Accordance with Isaiah. The
Parable of the Great Supper a Pictorial Sketch of the Creator’s Own Dispensations
of Mercy and Grace. The Rejections of the Invitation Paralleled by Quotations
from the Old Testament. Marcion’s Christ Could Not Fulfil the Conditions Indicated
in This Parable. The Absurdity of the Marcionite Interpretation.</head>
<p>What kind of persons does He bid should be invited to a dinner or a supper?4726 Precisely
such as he had pointed out by Isaiah: “Deal thy bread to the hungry man; and the beggars—
even such as have no home—bring in to thine house,”4727 because, no doubt, they
are “unable to recompense” your act of humanity. Now, since Christ forbids the recompense
to be expected now, but promises it “at the resurrection,” this is the very plan4728 of the
Creator, who dislikes those who love gifts and follow after reward. Consider also to which
deity4729 is better suited the parable of him who issued invitations: “A certain man made a
great supper, and bade many.”4730 The preparation for the supper is no doubt a figure of
the abundant provision4731 of eternal life. I first remark, that strangers, and persons unconnected
by ties of relationship, are not usually invited to a supper; but that members of the
household and family are more frequently the favoured guests. To the Creator, then, it belonged
to give the invitation, to whom also appertained those who were to be invited—whether
considered as men, through their descent from Adam, or as Jews, by reason of their fathers;
not to him who possessed no claim to them either by nature or prerogative. My next remark
is,4732 if He issues the invitations who has prepared the supper, then, in this sense the supper
is the Creator’s, who sent to warn the guests. These had been indeed previously invited by
the fathers, but were to be admonished by the prophets. It certainly is not the feast of him
who never sent a messenger to warn—who never did a thing before towards issuing an invitation,
but came down himself on a sudden—only then4733 beginning to be known, when
already4734 giving his invitation; only then inviting, when already compelling to his banquet;
appointing one and the same hour both for the supper and the invitation. But when invited,
they excuse themselves.4735 And fairly enough, if the invitation came from the other god,

because it was so sudden; if, however, the excuse was not a fair one, then the invitation was
not a sudden one. Now, if the invitation was not a sudden one, it must have been given by
the Creator—even by Him of old time, whose call they had at last refused. They first refused
it when they said to Aaron, “Make us gods, which shall go before us;”4736 and again, afterwards,
when “they heard indeed with the ear, but did not understand”4737 their calling of
God. In a manner most germane4738 to this parable, He said by Jeremiah: “Obey my voice,
and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and ye shall walk in all my ways, which
I have commanded you.”4739 This is the invitation of God. “But,” says He, “they hearkened
not, nor inclined their ear.”4740 This is the refusal of the people. “They departed, and walked
every one in the imagination of their evil heart.”4741 “I have bought a field—and I have
bought some oxen—and I have married a wife.”4742 And still He urges them: “I have sent
unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early even before daylight.”4743 The Holy
Spirit is here meant, the admonisher of the guests. “Yet my people hearkened not unto me,
nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck.”4744 This was reported to the Master of the
family. Then He was moved (He did well to be moved; for, as Marcion denies emotion to
his god, He must be therefore my God), and commanded them to invite out of “the streets
and lanes of the city.”4745 Let us see whether this is not the same in purport as His words
by Jeremiah: “Have I been a wilderness to the house of Israel, or a land left uncultivated?”4746
That is to say: “Then have I none whom I may call to me; have I no place whence I may
bring them?” “Since my people have said, We will come no more unto thee.”4747 Therefore
He sent out to call others, but from the same city.4748 My third remark is this,4749 that although
the place abounded with people, He yet commanded that they gather men from the

highways and the hedges. In other words, we are now gathered out of the Gentile strangers;
with that jealous resentment, no doubt, which He expressed in Deuteronomy: “I will hide
my face from them, and I will show them what shall happen in the last days4750 (how that
others shall possess their place); for they are a froward generation, children in whom is no
faith. They have moved me to jealousy by that which is no god, and they have provoked me
to anger with their idols; and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people:
I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation”4751—even with us, whose hope the Jews
still entertain.4752 But this hope the Lord says they should not realize;4753 “Sion being left
as a cottage4754 in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers,”4755 since the nation
rejected the latest invitation to Christ. (Now, I ask,) after going through all this course of
the Creator’s dispensation and prophecies, what there is in it which can possibly be assigned
to him who has done all his work at one hasty stroke,4756 and possesses neither the Creator’s4757
course nor His dispensation in harmony with the parable? Or, again in what will
consist his first invitation,4758 and what his admonition4759 at the second stage? Some at
first would surely decline; others afterwards must have accepted.”4760 But now he comes to
invite both parties promiscuously out of the city,4761 out of the hedges,4762 contrary to the
drift4763 of the parable. It is impossible for him now to condemn as scorners of his invitation4764
those whom he has never yet invited, and whom he is approaching with so much
earnestness. If, however, he condemns them beforehand as about to reject his call, then be-

forehand he also predicts4765 the election of the Gentiles in their stead. Certainly4766 he
means to come the second time for the very purpose of preaching to the heathen. But even
if he does mean to come again, I imagine it will not be with the intention of any longer inviting
guests, but of giving to them their places. Meanwhile, you who interpret the call to
this supper as an invitation to a heavenly banquet of spiritual satiety and pleasure, must remember
that the earthly promises also of wine and oil and corn, and even of the city, are

<p>Who sought after the lost sheep and the lost piece of silver?4767 Was it not the loser?
But who was the loser? Was it not he who once possessed4768 them? Who, then, was that?
Was it not he to whom they belonged?4769 Since, then, man is the property of none other
than the Creator, He possessed Him who owned him; He lost him who once possessed him;
He sought him who lost him; He found him who sought him; He rejoiced who found him.
Therefore the purport4770 of neither parable has anything whatever to do with him4771 to
whom belongs neither the sheep nor the piece of silver, that is to say, man. For he lost him
not, because he possessed him not; and he sought him not, because he lost him not; and he
found him not, because he sought him not; and he rejoiced not, because he found him not.
Therefore, to rejoice over the sinner’s repentance—that is, at the recovery of lost man—is
the attribute of Him who long ago professed that He would rather that the sinner should
repent and not die.</p>

The Prophets Justify Christ’s Admonition Against Covetousness and Pride. John

Said Christ—But So Also Had Isaiah Said Long Before. One Only God, the Creator,
by His Own Will Changed the Dispensations. No New God Had a Hand

<p>What the two masters are who, He says, cannot be served,4772 on the ground that while
one is pleased4773 the other must needs be displeased,4774 He Himself makes clear, when
He mentions God and mammon. Then, if you have no interpreter by you, you may learn
again from Himself what He would have understood by mammon.4775 For when advising
us to provide for ourselves the help of friends in worldly affairs, after the example of that
steward who, when removed from his office,4776 relieves his lord’s debtors by lessening their
debts with a view to their recompensing him with their help, He said, “And I say unto you,
Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness,” that is to say, of money,
even as the steward had done. Now we are all of us aware that money is the instigator4777
of unrighteousness, and the lord of the whole world. Therefore, when he saw the covetousness
of the Pharisees doing servile worship4778 to it, He hurled4779 this sentence against them,
“Ye cannot serve God and mammon.”4780 Then the Pharisees, who were covetous of riches,
derided Him, when they understood that by mammon He meant money. Let no one think
that under the word mammon the Creator was meant, and that Christ called them off from
the service of the Creator. What folly! Rather learn therefrom that one God was pointed out
by Christ. For they were two masters whom He named, God and mammon—the Creator
and money. You cannot indeed serve God—Him, of course whom they seemed to serve—and

mammon to whom they preferred to devote themselves.4781 If, however, he was giving
himself out as another god, it would not be two masters, but three, that he had pointed out.
For the Creator was a master, and much more of a master, to be sure,4782 than mammon,
and more to be adored, as being more truly our Master. Now, how was it likely that He who
had called mammon a master, and had associated him with God, should say nothing of Him
who was really the Master of even these, that is, the Creator? Or else, by this silence respecting
Him did He concede that service might be rendered to Him, since it was to Himself alone
and to mammon that He said service could not be (simultaneously) rendered? When,
therefore, He lays down the position that God is one, since He would have been sure to
mention4783 the Creator if He were Himself a rival4784 to Him, He did (virtually) name the
Creator, when He refrained from insisting”4785 that He was Master alone, without a rival
god. Accordingly, this will throw light upon the sense in which it was said, “If ye have not
been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?”4786
“In the unrighteous mammon,” that is to say, in unrighteous riches, not in the Creator; for
even Marcion allows Him to be righteous: “And if ye have not been faithful in that which
is another man’s, who will give to you that which is mine?”4787 For whatever is unrighteous
ought to be foreign to the servants of God. But in what way was the Creator foreign to the
Pharisees, seeing that He was the proper God of the Jewish nation? Forasmuch then as the
words, “Who will entrust to you the truer riches?” and, “Who will give you that which is
mine?” are only suitable to the Creator and not to mammon, He could not have uttered
them as alien to the Creator, and in the interest of the rival god. He could only seem to have
spoken them in this sense, if, when remarking4788 their unfaithfulness to the Creator and
not to mammon, He had drawn some distinctions between the Creator (in his manner of
mentioning Him) and the rival god—how that the latter would not commit his own truth
to those who were unfaithful to the Creator. How then can he possibly seem to belong to
another god, if He be not set forth, with the express intention of being separated4789 from
the very thing which is in question. But when the Pharisees “justified themselves before
men,”4790 and placed their hope of reward in man, He censured them in the sense in which

the prophet Jeremiah said, “Cursed is the man that trusteth in man.”4791 Since the prophet
went on to say, “But the Lord knoweth your hearts,”4792 he magnified the power of that
God who declared Himself to be as a lamp, “searching the reins and the heart.”4793 When
He strikes at pride in the words: “That which is highly esteemed among men is abomination
in the sight of God,”4794 He recalls Isaiah: “For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon
every one that is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is arrogant and lifted up, and
they shall be brought low.”4795 I can now make out why Marcion’s god was for so long an
age concealed. He was, I suppose, waiting until he had learnt all these things from the Creator.
He continued his pupillage up to the time of John, and then proceeded forthwith to
announce the kingdom of God, saying: “The law and the prophets were until John; since
that time the kingdom of God is proclaimed.”4796 Just as if we also did not recognise in John
a certain limit placed between the old dispensation and the new, at which Judaism ceased
and Christianity began—without, however, supposing that it was by the power of another
god that there came about a cessation4797 of the law and the prophets and the commencement
of that gospel in which is the kingdom of God, Christ Himself. For although, as we have
shown, the Creator foretold that the old state of things would pass away and a new state
would succeed, yet, inasmuch as John is shown to be both the forerunner and the preparer
of the ways of that Lord who was to introduce the gospel and publish the kingdom of God,
it follows from the very fact that John has come, that Christ must be that very Being who
was to follow His harbinger John. So that, if the old course has ceased and the new has begun,
with John intervening between them, there will be nothing wonderful in it, because it happens
according to the purpose of the Creator; so that you may get a better proof for the kingdom
of God from any quarter, however anomalous,4798 than from the conceit that the law and
the prophets ended in John, and a new state of things began after him. “More easily, therefore,
may heaven and earth pass away—as also the law and the prophets—than that one tittle of
the Lord’s words should fail.”4799 “For,” as says Isaiah: “the word of our God shall stand for
ever.”4800 Since even then by Isaiah it was Christ, the Word and Spirit4801 of the Creator,

<head>Chapter XXXIV.—Moses, Allowing Divorce, and Christ Prohibiting It, Explained.
John Baptist and Herod. Marcion’s Attempt to Discover an Antithesis in the
Parable of the Rich Man and the Poor Man in Hades Confuted. The Creator’s
Appointment Manifested in Both States.</head>
<p>But Christ prohibits divorce, saying, “Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth
another, committeth adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband,
also committeth adultery.”4803 In order to forbid divorce, He makes it unlawful to
marry a woman that has been put away. Moses, however, permitted repudiation in Deuteronomy:
“When a man hath taken a wife, and hath lived with her, and it come to pass that
she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found unchastity in her; then let him write
her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand, and send her away out of his house.”4804
You see, therefore, that there is a difference between the law and the gospel—between Moses
and Christ?4805 To be sure there is!4806 But then you have rejected that other gospel which
witnesses to the same verity and the same Christ.4807 There, while prohibiting divorce, He
has given us a solution of this special question respecting it: “Moses,” says He, “because of
the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to give a bill of divorcement; but from the beginning
it was not so”4808—for this reason, indeed, because He who had “made them male and female”
had likewise said, “They twain shall become one flesh; what therefore God hath joined
together, let not man put asunder.”4809 Now, by this answer of His (to the Pharisees), He
both sanctioned the provision of Moses, who was His own (servant), and restored to its
primitive purpose4810 the institution of the Creator, whose Christ He was. Since, however,
you are to be refuted out of the Scriptures which you have received, I will meet you on your
own ground, as if your Christ were mine. When, therefore, He prohibited divorce, and yet
at the same time represented4811 the Father, even Him who united male and female, must
He not have rather exculpated4812 than abolished the enactment of Moses? But, observe,
if this Christ be yours when he teaches contrary to Moses and the Creator, on the same

principle must He be mine if I can show that His teaching is not contrary to them. I maintain,
then, that there was a condition in the prohibition which He now made of divorce; the case
supposed being, that a man put away his wife for the express purpose of4813 marrying another.
His words are: “Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth
adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband, also committeth
adultery,”4814—“put away,” that is, for the reason wherefore a woman ought not to be dismissed,
that another wife may be obtained. For he who marries a woman who is unlawfully
put away is as much of an adulterer as the man who marries one who is un-divorced. Permanent
is the marriage which is not rightly dissolved; to marry,4815 therefore, whilst matrimony
is undissolved, is to commit adultery. Since, therefore, His prohibition of divorce was
a conditional one, He did not prohibit absolutely; and what He did not absolutely forbid,
that He permitted on some occasions,4816 when there is an absence of the cause why He
gave His prohibition. In very deed4817 His teaching is not contrary to Moses, whose precept
He partially4818 defends, I will not4819 say confirms. If, however, you deny that divorce is
in any way permitted by Christ, how is it that you on your side4820 destroy marriage, not
uniting man and woman, nor admitting to the sacrament of baptism and of the eucharist
those who have been united in marriage anywhere else,4821 unless they should agree together
to repudiate the fruit of their marriage, and so the very Creator Himself? Well, then, what
is a husband to do in your sect,4822 if his wife commit adultery? Shall he keep her? But your
own apostle, you know,4823 does not permit “the members of Christ to be joined to a harlot.”
4824 Divorce, therefore, when justly deserved,4825 has even in Christ a defender. So that
Moses for the future must be considered as being confirmed by Him, since he prohibits divorce
in the same sense as Christ does, if any unchastity should occur in the wife. For in the
Gospel of Matthew he says, “Whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of

fornication, causeth her to commit adultery.”4826 He also is deemed equally guilty of adultery,
who marries a woman put away by her husband. The Creator, however, except on account
of adultery, does not put asunder what He Himself joined together, the same Moses in another
passage enacting that he who had married after violence to a damsel, should thenceforth
not have it in his power to put away his wife.4827 Now, if a compulsory marriage contracted
after violence shall be permanent, how much rather shall a voluntary one, the result of
agreement! This has the sanction of the prophet: “Thou shalt not forsake the wife of thy
youth.”4828 Thus you have Christ following spontaneously the tracks of the Creator everywhere,
both in permitting divorce and in forbidding it. You find Him also protecting marriage,
in whatever direction you try to escape. He prohibits divorce when He will have the
marriage inviolable; He permits divorce when the marriage is spotted with unfaithfulness.
You should blush when you refuse to unite those whom even your Christ has united; and
repeat the blush when you disunite them without the good reason why your Christ would
have them separated. I have4829 now to show whence the Lord derived this decision4830 of
His, and to what end He directed it. It will thus become more fully evident that His object
was not the abolition of the Mosaic ordinance4831 by any suddenly devised proposal of divorce;
because it was not suddenly proposed, but had its root in the previously mentioned
John. For John reproved Herod, because he had illegally married the wife of his deceased
brother, who had a daughter by her (a union which the law permitted only on the one occasion
of the brother dying childless,4832 when it even prescribed such a marriage, in order
that by his own brother, and from his own wife,4833 seed might be reckoned to the deceased
husband),4834 and was in consequence cast into prison, and finally, by the same Herod, was
even put to death. The Lord having therefore made mention of John, and of course of the
occurrence of his death, hurled His censure4835 against Herod in the form of unlawful
marriages and of adultery, pronouncing as an adulterer even the man who married a woman
that had been put away from her husband. This he said in order the more severely to load
Herod with guilt, who had taken his brother’s wife, after she had been loosed from her

husband not less by death than by divorce; who had been impelled thereto by his lust, not
by the prescription of the (Levirate) law—for, as his brother had left a daughter, the marriage
with the widow could not be lawful on that very account;4836 and who, when the prophet
asserted against him the law, had therefore put him to death. The remarks I have advanced
on this case will be also of use to me in illustrating the subsequent parable of the rich man4837
tormented in hell, and the poor man resting in Abraham’s bosom.4838 For this passage, so
far as its letter goes, comes before us abruptly; but if we regard its sense and purport, it
naturally4839 fits in with the mention of John wickedly slain, and of Herod, who had been
condemned by him for his impious marriage.4840 It sets forth in bold outline4841 the end
of both of them, the “torments” of Herod and the “comfort” of John, that even now Herod
might hear that warning: “They have there Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.”4842
Marcion, however, violently turns the passage to another end, and decides that both the
torment and the comfort are retributions of the Creator reserved in the next life4843 for
those who have obeyed the law and the prophets; whilst he defines the heavenly bosom and
harbour to belong to Christ and his own god. Our answer to this is, that the Scripture itself
which dazzles4844 his sight expressly distinguishes between Abraham’s bosom, where the
poor man dwells, and the infernal place of torment. “Hell” (I take it) means one thing, and
“Abraham’s bosom” another. “A great gulf” is said to separate those regions, and to hinder
a passage from one to the other. Besides, the rich man could not have “lifted up his eyes,”4845
and from a distance too, except to a superior height, and from the said distance all up through
the vast immensity of height and depth. It must therefore be evident to every man of intelligence
who has ever heard of the Elysian fields, that there is some determinate place called
Abraham’s bosom, and that it is designed for the reception of the souls of Abraham’s children,
even from among the Gentiles (since he is “the father of many nations,” which must be
classed amongst his family), and of the same faith as that wherewithal he himself believed
God, without the yoke of the law and the sign of circumcision. This region, therefore, I call
Abraham’s bosom. Although it is not in heaven, it is yet higher than hell,4846 and is appointed

to afford an interval of rest to the souls of the righteous, until the consummation of all things
shall complete the resurrection of all men with the “full recompense of their reward.”4847
This consummation will then be manifested in heavenly promises, which Marcion, however,
claims for his own god, just as if the Creator had never announced them. Amos, however,
tells us of “those stories towards heaven”4848 which Christ “builds”—of course for His
people. There also is that everlasting abode of which Isaiah asks, “Who shall declare unto
you the eternal place, but He (that is, of course, Christ) who walketh in righteousness,
speaketh of the straight path, hateth injustice and iniquity?”4849 Now, although this everlasting
abode is promised, and the ascending stories (or steps) to heaven are built by the Creator,
who further promises that the seed of Abraham shall be even as the stars of heaven, by virtue
certainly of the heavenly promise, why may it not be possible,4850 without any injury to that
promise, that by Abraham’s bosom is meant some temporary receptacle of faithful souls,
wherein is even now delineated an image of the future, and where is given some foresight
of the glory4851 of both judgments? If so, you have here, O heretics, during your present
lifetime, a warning that Moses and the prophets declare one only God, the Creator, and His
only Christ, and how that both awards of everlasting punishment and eternal salvation rest
with Him, the one only God, who kills and who makes alive. Well, but the admonition, says
Marcion, of our God from heaven has commanded us not to hear Moses and the prophets,
but Christ; Hear Him is the command.4852 This is true enough. For the apostles had by that
time sufficiently heard Moses and the prophets, for they had followed Christ, being persuaded
by Moses and the prophets. For even Peter would not have been able4853 to say, “Thou art
the Christ,”4854 unless he had beforehand heard and believed Moses and the prophets, by
whom alone Christ had been hitherto announced. Their faith, indeed, had deserved this
confirmation by such a voice from heaven as should bid them hear Him, whom they had
recognized as preaching peace, announcing glad tidings, promising an everlasting abode,
building for them steps upwards into heaven.4855 Down in hell, however, it was said con-

Moses and the prophets, but decreed by that God, who deposes princes from their thrones,

Creator to pronounce different sentences in the two directions of reward and punishment,

<p>Then, turning to His disciples, He says: “Woe unto him through whom offences come!
It were better for him if he had not been born, or if a millstone were hanged about his neck
and he were cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones,”4860 that
is, one of His disciples. Judge, then, what the sort of punishment is which He so severely
threatens. For it is no stranger who is to avenge the offence done to His disciples. Recognise
also in Him the Judge, and one too, who expresses Himself on the safety of His followers
with the same tenderness as that which the Creator long ago exhibited: “He that toucheth
you toucheth the apple of my eye.”4861 Such identity of care proceeds from one and the
same Being. A trespassing brother He will have rebuked.4862 If one failed in this duty of
reproof, he in fact sinned, either because out of hatred he wished his brother to continue in
sin, or else spared him from mistaken friendship,4863 although possessing the injunction
in Leviticus: “Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart; thy neighbor thou shalt seriously
rebuke, and on his account shalt not contract sin.”4864 Nor is it to be wondered at, if He
thus teaches who forbids your refusing to bring back even your brother’s cattle, if you find
them astray in the road; much more should you bring back your erring brother to himself.
He commands you to forgive your brother, should he trespass against you even “seven
times.”4865 But that surely, is a small matter; for with the Creator there is a larger grace,
when He sets no limits to forgiveness, indefinitely charging you “not to bear any malice
against your brother,”4866 and to give not merely to him who asks, but even to him who
does not ask. For His will is, not that you should forgive4867 an offence, but forget it. The

law about lepers had a profound meaning as respects4868 the forms of the disease itself, and
of the inspection by the high priest.4869 The interpretation of this sense it will be our task
to ascertain. Marcion’s labour, however, is to object to us the strictness4870 of the law, with
the view of maintaining that here also Christ is its enemy—forestalling4871 its enactments
even in His cure of the ten lepers. These He simply commanded to show themselves to the
priest; “and as they went, He cleansed them”4872—without a touch, and without a word, by
His silent power and simple will. Well, but what necessity was there for Christ, who had
been once for all announced as the healer of our sicknesses and sins, and had proved Himself
such by His acts,4873 to busy Himself with inquiries4874 into the qualities and details of
cures; or for the Creator to be summoned to the scrutiny of the law in the person of Christ?
If any part of this healing was effected by Him in a way different from the law, He yet
Himself did it to perfection; for surely the Lord may by Himself, or by His Son, produce
after one manner, and after another manner by His servants the prophets, those proofs of
His power and might especially, which (as excelling in glory and strength, because they are
His own acts) rightly enough leave in the distance behind them the works which are done
by His servants. But enough has been already said on this point in a former passage.4875
Now, although He said in a preceding chapter,4876 that “there were many lepers in Israel
in the days of Eliseus the prophet, and none of them was cleansed saving Naaman the Syrian,”
yet of course the mere number proves nothing towards a difference in the gods, as tending
to the abasement4877 of the Creator in curing only one, and the pre-eminence of Him who
healed ten. For who can doubt that many might have been cured by Him who cured one
more easily than ten by him who had never healed one before? But His main purpose in
this declaration was to strike at the unbelief or the pride of Israel, in that (although there
were many lepers amongst them, and a prophet was not wanting to them) not one had been
moved even by so conspicuous an example to betake himself to God who was working in
His prophets. Forasmuch, then, as He was Himself the veritable4878 High Priest of God the

Father, He inspected them according to the hidden purport of the law, which signified that
Christ was the true distinguisher and extinguisher of the defilements of mankind. However,
what was obviously required by the law He commanded should be done: “Go,” said He,
“show yourselves to the priests.”4879 Yet why this, if He meant to cleanse them first? Was
it as a despiser of the law, in order to prove to them that, having been cured already on the
road, the law was now nothing to them, nor even the priests? Well, the matter must of
course pass as it best may,4880 if anybody supposes that Christ had such views as these!4881
But there are certainly better interpretations to be found of the passage, and more deserving
of belief: how that they were cleansed on this account, because4882 they were obedient, and
went as the law required, when they were commanded to go to the priests; and it is not to
be believed that persons who observed the law could have found a cure from a god that was
destroying the law. Why, however, did He not give such a command to the leper who first
returned?4883 Because Elisha did not in the case of Naaman the Syrian, and yet was not on
that account less the Creator’s agent? This is a sufficient answer. But the believer knows that
there is a profounder reason. Consider, therefore, the true motives.4884 The miracle was
performed in the district of Samaria, to which country also belonged one of the lepers.4885
Samaria, however, had revolted from Israel, carrying with it the disaffected nine tribes,4886
which, having been alienated4887 by the prophet Ahijah,4888 Jeroboam settled in Samaria.
Besides, the Samaritans were always pleased with the mountains and the wells of their ancestors.
Thus, in the Gospel of John, the woman of Samaria, when conversing with the Lord
at the well, says, “No doubt4889 Thou art greater,” etc.; and again, “Our fathers worshipped
in this mountain; but ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.”4890

Accordingly, He who said, “Woe unto them that trust in the mountain of Samaria,”4891
vouchsafing now to restore that very region, purposely requests the men “to go and show
themselves to the priests,” because these were to be found only there where the temple was;
submitting4892 the Samaritan to the Jew, inasmuch as “salvation was of the Jews,”4893
whether to the Israelite or the Samaritan. To the tribe of Judah, indeed, wholly appertained
the promised Christ,4894 in order that men might know that at Jerusalem were both the
priests and the temple; that there also was the womb4895 of religion, and its living fountain,
not its mere “well.”4896 Seeing, therefore, that they recognised4897 the truth that at Jerusalem
the law was to be fulfilled, He healed them, whose salvation was to come4898 of faith4899
without the ceremony of the law. Whence also, astonished that one only out of the ten was
thankful for his release to the divine grace, He does not command him to offer a gift according
to the law, because he had already paid his tribute of gratitude when “he glorified God”;4900
for thus did the Lord will that the law’s requirement should be interpreted. And yet who
was the God to whom the Samaritan gave thanks, because thus far not even had an Israelite
heard of another god? Who else but He by whom all had hitherto been healed through
Christ? And therefore it was said to him, “Thy faith hath made thee whole,”4901 because he
had discovered that it was his duty to render the true oblation to Almighty God—even
thanksgiving—in His true temple, and before His true High Priest Jesus Christ. But it is
impossible either that the Pharisees should seem to have inquired of the Lord about the
coming of the kingdom of the rival god, when no other god has ever yet been announced
by Christ; or that He should have answered them concerning the kingdom of any other god
than Him of whom they were in the habit of asking Him. “The kingdom of God,” He says,
“cometh not with observation; neither do they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the
kingdom of God is within you.”4902 Now, who will not interpret the words “within you” to
mean in your hand, within your power, if you hear, and do the commandment of God? If,

however, the kingdom of God lies in His commandment, set before your mind Moses on
the other side, according to our antitheses, and you will find the self-same view of the case.4903
“The commandment is not a lofty one,4904 neither is it far off from thee. It is not in heaven,
that thou shouldest say, ‘Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may
hear it, and do it?’ nor is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, ‘Who shall go over the
sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?’ But the word is very nigh
unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, and in thy hands, to do it.”4905 This means,
“Neither in this place nor that place is the kingdom of God; for, behold, it is within you.”4906
And if the heretics, in their audacity, should contend that the Lord did not give an answer
about His own kingdom, but only about the Creator’s kingdom, concerning which they had
inquired, then the following words are against them. For He tells them that “the Son of man
must suffer many things, and be rejected,” before His coming,4907 at which His kingdom
will be really4908 revealed. In this statement He shows that it was His own kingdom which
His answer to them had contemplated, and which was now awaiting His own sufferings and
rejection. But having to be rejected and afterwards to be acknowledged, and taken up4909
and glorified, He borrowed the very word “rejected” from the passage, where, under the
figure of a stone, His twofold manifestation was celebrated by David—the first in rejection,
the second in honour: “The stone,” says He, “which the builders rejected, is become the
head-stone of the corner. This is the Lord’s doing.”4910 Now it would be idle, if we believed
that God had predicted the humiliation, or even the glory, of any Christ at all, that He could
have signed His prophecy for any but Him whom He had foretold under the figure of a
stone, and a rock, and a mountain.4911 If, however, He speaks of His own coming, why does
He compare it with the days of Noe and of Lot,4912 which were dark and terrible—a mild
and gentle God as He is? Why does He bid us “remember Lot’s wife,”4913 who despised the
Creator’s command, and was punished for her contempt, if He does not come with judgment
to avenge the infraction of His precepts? If He really does punish, like the Creator,4914 if

Salutation—Son of David. All Proofs of Christ’s Relation to the Creator, Marcion’s
Antithesis Between David and Christ Confuted.</head>
<p>When He recommends perseverance and earnestness in prayer, He sets before us the
parable of the judge who was compelled to listen to the widow, owing to the earnestness
and importunity of her requests.4917 He show us that it is God the judge whom we must
importune with prayer, and not Himself, if He is not Himself the judge. But He added, that
“God would avenge His own elect.”4918 Since, then, He who judges will also Himself be the
avenger, He proved that the Creator is on that account the specially good God,4919 whom
He represented as the avenger of His own elect, who cry day and night to Him. And yet,
when He introduces to our view the Creator’s temple, and describes two men worshipping
therein with diverse feelings—the Pharisee in pride, the publican in humility—and shows
us how they accordingly went down to their homes, one rejected,4920 the other justified,4921
He surely, by thus teaching us the proper discipline of prayer, has determined that that God
must be prayed to from whom men were to receive this discipline of prayer—whether condemnatory
of pride, or justifying in humility.4922 I do not find from Christ any temple, any
suppliants, any sentence (of approval or condemnation) belonging to any other god than
the Creator. Him does He enjoin us to worship in humility, as the lifter-up of the humble,
not in pride, because He brings down4923 the proud. What other god has He manifested to
me to receive my supplications? With what formula of worship, with what hope (shall I
approach him?) I trow, none. For the prayer which He has taught us suits, as we have
proved,4924 none but the Creator. It is, of course, another matter if He does not wish to be
prayed to, because He is the supremely and spontaneously good God! But who is this good
God? There is, He says, “none but one.”4925 It is not as if He had shown us that one of two
gods was the supremely good; but He expressly asserts that there is one only good God, who
is the only good, because He is the only God. Now, undoubtedly,4926 He is the good God

who “sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust, and maketh His sun to rise on the evil and
on the good;”4927 sustaining and nourishing and assisting even Marcionites themselves!
When afterwards “a certain man asked him, ‘Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal
life?’” (Jesus) inquired whether he knew (that is, in other words, whether he kept) the commandments
of the Creator, in order to testify4928 that it was by the Creator’s precepts that
eternal life is acquired.4929 Then, when he affirmed that from his youth up he had kept all
the principal commandments, (Jesus) said to him: “One thing thou yet lackest: sell all that
thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow
me.”4930 Well now, Marcion, and all ye who are companions in misery, and associates in
hatred4931 with that heretic, what will you dare say to this? Did Christ rescind the forementioned
commandments: “Do not kill, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear
false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother?” Or did He both keep them, and then
add4932 what was wanting to them? This very precept, however, about giving to the poor,
was very largely4933 diffused through the pages of the law and the prophets. This vainglorious
observer of the commandments was therefore convicted4934 of holding money in much
higher estimation (than charity). This verity of the gospel then stands unimpaired: “I am
not come to destroy the law and the prophets, but rather to fulfil them.”4935 He also dissipated
other doubts, when He declared that the name of God and of the Good belonged to one and
the same being, at whose disposal were also the everlasting life and the treasure in heaven
and Himself too—whose commandments He both maintained and augmented with His
own supplementary precepts. He may likewise be discovered in the following passage of
Micah, saying: “He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require
of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to be ready to follow the Lord thy God?”4936
Now Christ is the man who tells us what is good, even the knowledge of the law. “Thou
knowest,” says He, “the commandments.” “To do justly”—“Sell all that thou hast;” “to love
mercy”—“Give to the poor:” “and to be ready to walk with God”—“And come,” says He,

“follow me.”4937 The Jewish nation was from its beginning so carefully divided into tribes
and clans, and families and houses, that no man could very well have been ignorant of his
descent—even from the recent assessments of Augustus, which were still probably extant
at this time.4938 But the Jesus of Marcion (although there could be no doubt of a person’s
having been born, who was seen to be a man), as being unborn, could not, of course, have
possessed any public testimonial4939 of his descent, but was to be regarded as one of that
obscure class of whom nothing was in any way known. Why then did the blind man, on
hearing that He was passing by, exclaim, “Jesus, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me?”4940
unless he was considered, in no uncertain manner,4941 to be the Son of David (in other
words, to belong to David’s family) through his mother and his brethren, who at some time
or other had been made known to him by public notoriety? “Those, however, who went
before rebuked the blind man, that he should hold his peace.”4942 And properly enough;
because he was very noisy, not because he was wrong about the son of David. Else you must
show me, that those who rebuked him were aware that Jesus was not the Son of David, in
order that they may be supposed to have had this reason for imposing silence on the blind
man. But even if you could show me this, still (the blind man) would more readily have
presumed that they were ignorant, than that the Lord could possibly have permitted an
untrue exclamation about Himself. But the Lord “stood patient.”4943 Yes; but not as confirming
the error, for, on the contrary, He rather displayed the Creator. Surely He could
not have first removed this man’s blindness, in order that he might afterwards cease to regard
Him as the Son of David! However,4944 that you may not slander4945 His patience, nor
fasten on Him any charge of dissimulation, nor deny Him to be the Son of David, He very
pointedly confirmed the exclamation of the blind man—both by the actual gift of healing,
and by bearing testimony to his faith: “Thy faith,” say Christ, “hath made thee whole.”4946
What would you have the blind man’s faith to have been? That Jesus was descended from
that (alien) god (of Marcion), to subvert the Creator and overthrow the law and the prophets?

the restorer4947 also of the blind? But I apprehend there were at that time no such stoneblind
persons as Marcion, that an opinion like this could have constituted the faith of the
blind man, and have induced him to confide in the mere name,4948 of Jesus, the Son of
David. He, who knew all this of Himself,4949 and wished others to know it also, endowed
the faith of this man—although it was already gifted with a better sight, and although it was
in possession of the true light—with the external vision likewise, in order that we too might
learn the rule of faith, and at the same time find its recompense. Whosoever wishes to see
Jesus the Son of David must believe in Him; through the Virgin’s birth.4950 He who will not
believe this will not hear from Him the salutation, “Thy faith hath saved thee.” And so he
will remain blind, falling into Antithesis after Antithesis, which mutually destroy each other,
4951 just as “the blind man leads the blind down into the ditch.”4952 For (here is one of
Marcion’s Antitheses): whereas David in old time, in the capture of Sion, was offended by
the blind who opposed his admission (into the stronghold)4953—in which respect (I should
rather say) that they were a type of people equally blind,4954 who in after-times would not
admit Christ to be the son of David—so, on the contrary, Christ succoured the blind man,
to show by this act that He was not David’s son, and how different in disposition He was,
kind to the blind, while David ordered them to be slain.4955 If all this were so, why did
Marcion allege that the blind man’s faith was of so worthless4956 a stamp? The fact is,4957
the Son of David so acted,4958 that the Antithesis must lose its point by its own absurdity.4959
Those persons who offended David were blind, and the man who now presents himself as
a suppliant to David’s son is afflicted with the same infirmity.4960 Therefore the Son of
David was appeased with some sort of satisfaction by the blind man when He restored him

a Judge, Who is to Administer the Will of the Austere Man, I.e. The Creator.</head>
<p>“Salvation comes to the house” of Zacchæus even.4962 For what reason? Was it because
he also believed that Christ came by Marcion? But the blind man’s cry was still sounding in
the ears of all: “Jesus, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.” And “all the people gave
praise unto God”—not Marcion’s, but David’s. Now, although Zacchæus was probably a
Gentile,4963 he yet from his intercourse with Jews had obtained a smattering4964 of their
Scriptures, and, more than this, had, without knowing it, fulfilled the precepts of Isaiah:
“Deal thy bread,” said the prophet, “to the hungry, and bring the poor that are cast out into
thine house.”4965 This he did in the best possible way, by receiving the Lord, and entertaining
Him in his house. “When thou seest the naked cover him.”4966 This he promised to do, in
an equally satisfactory way, when he offered the half of his goods for all works of mercy.4967
So also “he loosened the bands of wickedness, undid the heavy burdens, let the oppressed
go free, and broke every yoke,”4968 when he said, “If I have taken anything from any man
by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.”4969 Therefore the Lord said, “This day is salvation
come to this house.”4970 Thus did He give His testimony, that the precepts of the Creator
spoken by the prophet tended to salvation.4971 But when He adds, “For the Son of man is
come to seek and to save that which was lost,”4972 my present contention is not whether
He was come to save what was lost, to whom it had once belonged, and from whom what
He came to save had fallen away; but I approach a different question. Man, there can be no
doubt of it, is here the subject of consideration. Now, since he consists of two parts,4973

body and soul, the point to be inquired into is, in which of these two man would seem to
have been lost? If in his body, then it is his body, not his soul, which is lost. What, however,
is lost, the Son of man saves. The body,4974 therefore, has the salvation. If, (on the other
hand,) it is in his soul that man is lost, salvation is designed for the lost soul; and the body
which is not lost is safe. If, (to take the only other supposition,) man is wholly lost, in both
his natures, then it necessarily follows that salvation is appointed for the entire man; and
then the opinion of the heretics is shivered to pieces,4975 who say that there is no salvation
of the flesh. And this affords a confirmation that Christ belongs to the Creator, who followed
the Creator in promising the salvation of the whole man. The parable also of the (ten) servants,
who received their several recompenses according to the manner in which they had
increased their lord’s money by trading4976 proves Him to be a God of judgment—even a
God who, in strict account,4977 not only bestows honour, but also takes away what a man

<p>Christ knew “the baptism of John, whence it was.”4981 Then why did He ask them, as
if He knew not? He knew that the Pharisees would not give Him an answer; then why did
He ask in vain? Was it that He might judge them out of their own mouth, or their own
heart? Suppose you refer these points to an excuse of the Creator, or to His comparison with
Christ; then consider what would have happened if the Pharisees had replied to His question.
Suppose their answer to have been, that John’s baptism was “of men,” they would have been
immediately stoned to death.4982 Some Marcion, in rivalry to Marcion, would have stood
up4983 and said: O most excellent God; how different are his ways from the Creator’s!
Knowing that men would rush down headlong over it, He placed them actually4984 on the
very precipice. For thus do men treat of the Creator respecting His law of the tree.4985 But
John’s baptism was “from heaven.” “Why, therefore,” asks Christ, “did ye not believe
him?”4986 He therefore who had wished men to believe John, purposing to censure4987
them because they had not believed him, belonged to Him whose sacrament John was administering.
But, at any rate,4988 when He actually met their refusal to say what they thought,
with such reprisals as, “Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things,”4989 He returned
evil for evil! “Render unto Cæsar the things which be Cæsar’s, and unto God the things
which be God’s.”4990 What will be “the things which are God’s?” Such things as are like
Cæsar’s denarius—that is to say, His image and similitude. That, therefore, which he commands
to be “rendered unto God,” the Creator, is man, who has been stamped with His
image, likeness, name, and substance.4991 Let Marcion’s god look after his own mint.4992

Christ bids the denarius of man’s imprint to be rendered to His Cæsar, (His Cæsar I say,)
not the Cæsar of a strange god.4993 The truth, however, must be confessed, this god has not
a denarius to call his own! In every question the just and proper rule is, that the meaning of
the answer ought to be adapted to the proposed inquiry. But it is nothing short of madness
to return an answer altogether different from the question submitted to you. God forbid,
then, that we should expect from Christ4994 conduct which would be unfit even to an ordinary
man! The Sadducees, who said there was no resurrection, in a discussion on that subject,
had proposed to the Lord a case of law touching a certain woman, who, in accordance with
the legal prescription, had been married to seven brothers who had died one after the other.
The question therefore was, to which husband must she be reckoned to belong in the resurrection?
4995 This, (observe,) was the gist of the inquiry, this was the sum and substance of
the dispute. And to it Christ was obliged to return a direct answer. He had nobody to fear;
that it should seem advisable4996 for Him either to evade their questions, or to make them
the occasion of indirectly mooting4997 a subject which He was not in the habit of teaching
publicly at any other time. He therefore gave His answer, that “the children of this world
marry.”4998 You see how pertinent it was to the case in point. Because the question concerned
the next world, and He was going to declare that no one marries there, He opens the way
by laying down the principles that here, where there is death, there is also marriage. “But
they whom God shall account worthy of the possession of that world and the resurrection
from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage; forasmuch as they cannot die any
more, since they become equal to the angels, being made the children of God and of the
resurrection.”4999 If, then, the meaning of the answer must not turn on any other point than
on the proposed question, and since the question proposed is fully understood from this
sense of the answer,5000 then the Lord’s reply admits of no other interpretation than that
by which the question is clearly understood.5001 You have both the time in which marriage
is permitted, and the time in which it is said to be unsuitable, laid before you, not on their
own account, but in consequence of an inquiry about the resurrection. You have likewise
a confirmation of the resurrection itself, and the whole question which the Sadducees mooted,

who asked no question about another god, nor inquired about the proper law of marriage.
Now, if you make Christ answer questions which were not submitted to Him, you, in fact,
represent Him as having been unable to solve the points on which He was really consulted,
and entrapped of course by the cunning of the Sadducees. I shall now proceed, by way of
supererogation,5002 and after the rule (I have laid down about questions and answers),5003
to deal with the arguments which have any consistency in them.5004 They procured then a
copy of the Scripture, and made short work with its text, by reading it thus:5005 “Those
whom the god of that world shall account worthy.” They add the phrase “of that world” to
the word “god,” whereby they make another god “the god of that world;” whereas the passage
ought to be read thus: “Those whom God shall account worthy of the possession of that
world” (removing the distinguishing phrase “of this world” to the end of the clause,5006 in
other words, “Those whom God shall account worthy of obtaining and rising to that world.”
For the question submitted to Christ had nothing to do with the god, but only with the state,
of that world. It was: “Whose wife should this woman be in that world after the resurrection?”
5007 They thus subvert His answer respecting the essential question of marriage, and
apply His words, “The children of this world marry and are given in marriage,” as if they
referred to the Creator’s men, and His permission to them to marry; whilst they themselves
whom the god of that world—that is, the rival god—accounted worthy of the resurrection,
do not marry even here, because they are not children of this world. But the fact is, that,
having been consulted about marriage in that world, not in this present one, He had simply

But there is another meaning of the word, which is not unknown to our author, equivalent to our objection

by which the defendant rebuts the plaintiff’s charge.” According to this sense, we read: “I shall now proceed…and

suit the order of the Latin, which differs from the English. The sentence in Latin is, “Quos autem dignatus est
Deus illius ævi possessione et resurrectione a mortuis.” The phrase in question is illius ævi. Where shall it stand?
The Marcionites placed it after “Deus” in government, but Tertullian (following the undoubted meaning of the
sentence) says it depends on “possessione et resurrectione,” i.e., “worthy of the possession, etc., of that world.”
To effect this construction, he says, “Ut facta hic distinctione post deum ad sequentia pertineat illius ævi;” i.e.,
he requests that a stop be placed after the word “deus,” whereby the phrase “illius ævi” will belong to the words
which follow—“possessione et resurrectione a mortuis.”</note>

declared the non-existence of that to which the question related. They, indeed, who had
caught the very force of His voice, and pronunciation, and expression, discovered no other
sense than what had reference to the matter of the question. Accordingly, the Scribes exclaimed,
“Master, Thou hast well said.”5008 For He had affirmed the resurrection, by describing
the form5009 thereof in opposition to the opinion of the Sadducees. Now, He did not
reject the attestation of those who had assumed His answer to bear this meaning. If, however,
the Scribes thought Christ was David’s Son, whereas (David) himself calls Him Lord,5010
what relation has this to Christ? David did not literally confute5011 an error of the Scribes,
yet David asserted the honour of Christ, when he more prominently affirmed that He was
his Lord than his Son,—an attribute which was hardly suitable to the destroyer of the Creator.
But how consistent is the interpretation on our side of the question! For He, who had been
a little while ago invoked by the blind man as “the Son of David,”5012 then made no remark
on the subject, not having the Scribes in His presence; whereas He now purposely moots
the point before them, and that of His own accord,5013 in order that He might show Himself
whom the blind man, following the doctrine of the Scribes, had simply declared to be the
Son of David, to be also his Lord. He thus honoured the blind man’s faith which had acknowledged
His Sonship to David; but at the same time He struck a blow at the tradition of the
Scribes, which prevented them from knowing that He was also (David’s) Lord. Whatever
had relation to the glory of the Creator’s Christ, no other would thus guard and maintain5014
but Himself the Creator’s Christ.</p>

<p>As touching the propriety of His names, it has already been seen5015 that both of
them5016 are suitable to Him who was the first both to announce His Christ to mankind,
and to give Him the further name5017 of Jesus. The impudence, therefore, of Marcion’s
Christ will be evident, when he says that many will come in his name, whereas this name
does not at all belong to him, since he is not the Christ and Jesus of the Creator, to whom
these names do properly appertain; and more especially when he prohibits those to be received
whose very equal in imposture he is, inasmuch as he (equally with them5018) comes
in a name which belongs to another—unless it was his business to warn off from a mendaciously
assumed name the disciples (of One) who, by reason of His name being properly
given to Him, possessed also the verity thereof. But when “they shall by and by come and
say, I am Christ,”5019 they will be received by you, who have already received one altogether
like them.5020 Christ, however, comes in His own name. What will you do, then, when He
Himself comes who is the very Proprietor of these names, the Creator’s Christ and Jesus?
Will you reject Him? But how iniquitous, how unjust and disrespectful to the good God,
that you should not receive Him who comes in His own name, when you have received
another in His name! Now, let us see what are the signs which He ascribes to the times.
“Wars,” I observe, “and kingdom against kingdom, and nation against nation, and pestilence,
and famines, and earthquakes, and fearful sights, and great signs from heaven”5021—all
which things are suitable for a severe and terrible God. Now, when He goes on to say that
“all these things must needs come to pass,”5022 what does He represent Himself to be? The
Destroyer, or the Defender of the Creator? For He affirms that these appointments of His
must fully come to pass; but surely as the good God, He would have frustrated rather than
advanced events so sad and terrible, if they had not been His own (decrees). “But before all

these,” He foretells that persecutions and sufferings were to come upon them, which indeed
were “to turn for a testimony to them,” and for their salvation.5023 Hear what is predicted
in Zechariah: “The Lord of hosts5024 shall protect them; and they shall devour them, and
subdue them with sling-stones; and they shall drink their blood like wine, and they shall fill
the bowls as it were of the altar. And the Lord shall save them in that day, even His people,
like sheep; because as sacred stones they roll,”5025 etc. And that you may not suppose that
these predictions refer to such sufferings as await them from so many wars with strangers,5026
consider the nature (of the sufferings). In a prophecy of wars which were to be waged with
legitimate arms, no one would think of enumerating stones as weapons, which are better
known in popular crowds and unarmed tumults. Nobody measures the copious streams of
blood which flow in war by bowlfuls, nor limits it to what is shed upon a single altar. No
one gives the name of sheep to those who fall in battle with arms in hand, and while repelling
force with force, but only to those who are slain, yielding themselves up in their own place
of duty and with patience, rather than fighting in self-defence. In short, as he says, “they
roll as sacred stones,” and not like soldiers fight. Stones are they, even foundation stones,
upon which we are ourselves edified—“built,” as St. Paul says, “upon the foundation of the
apostles,”5027 who, like “consecrated stones,” were rolled up and down exposed to the attack
of all men. And therefore in this passage He forbids men “to meditate before what they answer”
when brought before tribunals,5028 even as once He suggested to Balaam the message
which he had not thought of,5029 nay, contrary to what he had thought; and promised “a
mouth” to Moses, when he pleaded in excuse the slowness of his speech,5030 and that wisdom
which, by Isaiah, He showed to be irresistible: “One shall say, I am the Lord’s, and shall call
himself by the name of Jacob, and another shall subscribe himself by the name of Israel.”5031
Now, what plea is wiser and more irresistible than the simple and open5032 confession made
in a martyr’s cause, who “prevails with God”—which is what “Israel” means?5033 Now, one
cannot wonder that He forbade “premeditation,” who actually Himself received from the

Father the ability of uttering words in season: “The Lord hath given to me the tongue of the
learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season (to him that is weary);”5034 except
that Marcion introduces to us a Christ who is not subject to the Father. That persecutions
from one’s nearest friends are predicted, and calumny out of hatred to His name,5035 I need
not again refer to. But “by patience,”5036 says He, “ye shall yourselves be saved.”5037 Of this
very patience the Psalm says, “The patient endurance of the just shall not perish for ever;”5038
because it is said in another Psalm, “Precious (in the sight of the Lord) is the death of the
just”—arising, no doubt, out of their patient endurance, so that Zechariah declares: “A
crown shall be to them that endure.”5039 But that you may not boldly contend that it was
as announcers of another god that the apostles were persecuted by the Jews, remember that
even the prophets suffered the same treatment of the Jews, and that they were not the heralds
of any other god than the Creator. Then, having shown what was to be the period of the
destruction, even “when Jerusalem should begin to be compassed with armies,”5040 He described
the signs of the end of all things: “portents in the sun, and the moon, and the stars,
and upon the earth distress of nations in perplexity—like the sea roaring—by reason of their
expectation of the evils which are coming on the earth.”5041</p>
<p>That “the very powers also of heaven have to be shaken,”5042 you may find in Joel: “And
I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth—blood and fire, and pillars of smoke;
the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible
day of the Lord come.”5043 In Habakkuk also you have this statement: “With rivers shall
the earth be cleaved; the nations shall see thee, and be in pangs. Thou shalt disperse the
waters with thy step; the deep uttered its voice; the height of its fear was raised;5044 the sun
and the moon stood still in their course; into light shall thy coruscations go; and thy shield
shall be (like) the glittering of the lightning’s flash; in thine anger thou shalt grind the earth,

and shalt thresh the nations in thy wrath.”5045 There is thus an agreement, I apprehend,
between the sayings of the Lord and of the prophets touching the shaking of the earth, and
the elements, and the nations thereof. But what does the Lord say afterwards? “And then
shall they see the Son of man coming from the heavens with very great power. And when
these things shall come to pass, ye shall look up, and raise your heads; for your redemption
hath come near,” that is, at the time of the kingdom, of which the parable itself treats.5046
“So likewise ye, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of
God is nigh at hand.”5047 This will be the great day of the Lord, and of the glorious coming
of the Son of man from heaven, of which Daniel wrote: “Behold, one like the Son of man
came with the clouds of heaven,”5048 etc. “And there was given unto Him the kingly
power,”5049 which (in the parable) “He went away into a far country to receive for Himself,”
leaving money to His servants wherewithal to trade and get increase5050—even (that universal
kingdom of) all nations, which in the Psalm the Father had promised to give to Him: Ask
of me, and I will give Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.”5051 “And all that glory shall
serve Him; His dominion shall be an everlasting one, which shall not be taken from Him,
and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed,”5052 because in it “men shall not die,
neither shall they marry, but be like the angels.”5053 It is about the same advent of the Son
of man and the benefits thereof that we read in Habakkuk: “Thou wentest forth for the salvation
of Thy people, even to save Thine anointed ones,”5054—in other words, those who
shall look up and lift their heads, being redeemed in the time of His kingdom. Since, therefore,
these descriptions of the promises, on the one hand, agree together, as do also those of the
great catastrophes, on the other—both in the predictions of the prophets and the declarations
of the Lord, it will be impossible for you to interpose any distinction between them, as if
the catastrophes could be referred to the Creator, as the terrible God, being such as the good
god (of Marcion) ought not to permit, much less expect—whilst the promises should be
ascribed to the good god, being such as the Creator, in His ignorance of the said god, could
not have predicted. If, however, He did predict these promises as His own, since they differ

in no respect from the promises of Christ, He will be a match in the freeness of His gifts
with the good god himself; and evidently no more will have been promised by your Christ
than by my Son of man. (If you examine) the whole passage of this Gospel Scripture, from
the inquiry of the disciples5055 down to the parable of the fig-tree5056 you will find the sense
in its connection suit in every point the Son of man, so that it consistently ascribes to Him
both the sorrows and the joys, and the catastrophes and the promises; nor can you separate
them from Him in either respect. For as much, then, as there is but one Son of man whose
advent is placed between the two issues of catastrophe and promise, it must needs follow
that to that one Son of man belong both the judgments upon the nations, and the prayers
of the saints. He who thus comes in midway so as to be common to both issues, will terminate
one of them by inflicting judgment on the nations at His coming; and will at the same time
commence the other by fulfilling the prayers of His saints: so that if (on the one hand) you
grant that the coming of the Son of man is (the advent) of my Christ, then, when you ascribe
to Him the infliction of the judgments which precede His appearance, you are compelled
also to assign to Him the blessings which issue from the same. If (on the other hand) you
will have it that it is the coming of your Christ, then, when you ascribe to him the blessings
which are to be the result of his advent, you are obliged to impute to him likewise the infliction
of the evils which precede his appearance. For the evils which precede, and the blessings
which immediately follow, the coming of the Son of man, are both alike indissolubly connected
with that event. Consider, therefore, which of the two Christs you choose to place
in the person of the Son of man, to whom you may refer the execution of the two dispensations.
You make either the Creator a most beneficent God, or else your own god terrible in
his nature! Reflect, in short, on the picture presented in the parable: “Behold the fig-tree,
and all the trees; when they produce their fruit, men know that summer is at hand. So likewise
ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is very near.”5057
Now, if the fructification of the common trees5058 be an antecedent sign of the approach
of summer, so in like manner do the great conflicts of the world indicate the arrival of that
kingdom which they precede. But every sign is His, to whom belong the thing of which it
is the sign; and to everything is appointed its sign by Him to whom the thing belongs. If,
therefore, these tribulations are the signs of the kingdom, just as the maturity of the trees
is of the summer, it follows that the kingdom is the Creator’s to whom are ascribed the
tribulations which are the signs of the kingdom. Since the beneficent Deity had premised
that these things must needs come to pass, although so terrible and dreadful, as they had

been predicted by the law and the prophets, therefore He did not destroy the law and the
prophets, when He affirmed that what had been foretold therein must be certainly fulfilled.
He further declares, “that heaven and earth shall not pass away till all things be fulfilled.”5059
What things, pray, are these? Are they the things which the Creator made? Then the elements
will tractably endure the accomplishment of their Maker’s dispensation. If, however, they
emanate from your excellent god, I much doubt whether5060 the heaven and earth will
peaceably allow the completion of things which their Creator’s enemy has determined! If
the Creator quietly submits to this, then He is no “jealous God.” But let heaven and earth
pass away, since their Lord has so determined; only let His word remain for evermore! And
so Isaiah predicted that it should.5061 Let the disciples also be warned, “lest their hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and cares of this world; and so that day come
upon them unawares, like a snare”5062—if indeed they should forget God amidst the
abundance and occupation of the world. Like this will be found the admonition of Moses,—so
that He who delivers from “the snare” of that day is none other than He who so long before
addressed to men the same admonition.5063 Some places there were in Jerusalem where to
teach; other places outside Jerusalem whither to retire5064—“in the day-time He was
teaching in the temple;” just as He had foretold by Hosea: “In my house did they find me,
and there did I speak with them.”5065 “But at night He went out to the Mount of Olives.”
For thus had Zechariah pointed out: “And His feet shall stand in that day on the Mount of
Olives.”5066 Fit hours for an audience there also were. “Early in the morning”5067 must they
resort to Him, who (having said by Isaiah, “The Lord giveth me the tongue of the learned”)
added, “He hath appointed me the morning, and hath also given me an ear to hear.”5068

<head>Chapter XL.—How the Steps in the Passion of the Saviour Were Predetermined in
Prophecy. The Passover. The Treachery of Judas. The Institution of the Lord’s
Supper. The Docetic Error of Marcion Confuted by the Body and the Blood of
the Lord Jesus Christ.</head>
<p>In like manner does He also know the very time it behoved Him to suffer, since the law
prefigures His passion. Accordingly, of all the festal days of the Jews He chose the passover.
5070 In this Moses had declared that there was a sacred mystery:5071 “It is the Lord’s
passover.”5072 How earnestly, therefore, does He manifest the bent of His soul: “With desire
I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.”5073 What a destroyer of the law
was this, who actually longed to keep its passover! Could it be that He was so fond of Jewish
lamb?5074 But was it not because He had to be “led like a lamb to the slaughter; and because,
as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so was He not to open His mouth,”5075 that He so
profoundly wished to accomplish the symbol of His own redeeming blood? He might also
have been betrayed by any stranger, did I not find that even here too He fulfilled a Psalm:
“He who did eat bread with me hath lifted up5076 his heel against me.”5077 And without a
price might He have been betrayed. For what need of a traitor was there in the case of one
who offered Himself to the people openly, and might quite as easily have been captured by
force as taken by treachery? This might no doubt have been well enough for another Christ,
but would not have been suitable in One who was accomplishing prophecies. For it was
written, “The righteous one did they sell for silver.”5078 The very amount and the destination5079
of the money, which on Judas’ remorse was recalled from its first purpose of a fee,5080
and appropriated to the purchase of a potter’s field, as narrated in the Gospel of Matthew,
were clearly foretold by Jeremiah:5081 “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price

of Him who was valued5082 and gave them for the potter’s field.” When He so earnestly
expressed His desire to eat the passover, He considered it His own feast; for it would have
been unworthy of God to desire to partake of what was not His own. Then, having taken
the bread and given it to His disciples, He made it His own body, by saying, “This is my
body,”5083 that is, the figure of my body. A figure, however, there could not have been, unless
there were first a veritable body.5084 An empty thing, or phantom, is incapable of a figure.
If, however, (as Marcion might say,) He pretended the bread was His body, because He
lacked the truth of bodily substance, it follows that He must have given bread for us. It would
contribute very well to the support of Marcion’s theory of a phantom body,5085 that bread
should have been crucified! But why call His body bread, and not rather (some other edible
thing, say) a melon,5086 which Marcion must have had in lieu of a heart! He did not understand
how ancient was this figure of the body of Christ, who said Himself by Jeremiah: “I
was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter, and I knew not that5087 they devised
a device against me, saying, Let us cast the tree upon His bread,”5088 which means, of course,
the cross upon His body. And thus, casting light, as He always did, upon the ancient
prophecies,5089 He declared plainly enough what He meant by the bread, when He called
<note type="footnote">the prophecy to Jeremiah (“Jeremy the prophet,” ver. 9). This is not the place to do more than merely refer to
the voluminous controversy which has arisen from the apostle’s mention of Jeremiah instead of Zechariah. It
is enough to remark that Tertullian’s argument is unaffected by the discrepancy in the name of the particular
prophet. On all hands the prophecy is admitted, and this at once satisfies our author’s argument. For the ms.

the bread His own body. He likewise, when mentioning the cup and making the new testament
to be sealed “in His blood,”5090 affirms the reality of His body. For no blood can belong
to a body which is not a body of flesh. If any sort of body were presented to our view, which
is not one of flesh, not being fleshly, it would not possess blood. Thus, from the evidence of
the flesh, we get a proof of the body, and a proof of the flesh from the evidence of the blood.
In order, however, that you may discover how anciently wine is used as a figure for blood,
turn to Isaiah, who asks, “Who is this that cometh from Edom, from Bosor with garments
dyed in red, so glorious in His apparel, in the greatness of his might? Why are thy garments
red, and thy raiment as his who cometh from the treading of the full winepress?”5091 The
prophetic Spirit contemplates the Lord as if He were already on His way to His passion, clad
in His fleshly nature; and as He was to suffer therein, He represents the bleeding condition
of His flesh under the metaphor of garments dyed in red, as if reddened in the treading and
crushing process of the wine-press, from which the labourers descend reddened with the
wine-juice, like men stained in blood. Much more clearly still does the book of Genesis
foretell this, when (in the blessing of Judah, out of whose tribe Christ was to come according
to the flesh) it even then delineated Christ in the person of that patriarch,5092 saying, “He
washed His garments in wine, and His clothes in the blood of grapes”5093—in His garments
and clothes the prophecy pointed out his flesh, and His blood in the wine. Thus did He now
consecrate His blood in wine, who then (by the patriarch) used the figure of wine to describe
His blood.</p>

Christ to Be Such as Marcion Would Have Him to Be. Christ’s Conduct Before
the Council Explained. Christ Even Then Directs the Minds of His Judges to the
Prophetic Evidences of His Own Mission. The Moral Responsibility of These
Men Asserted.</head>
<p>“Woe,” says He, “to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed!”5094 Now it is certain
that in this woe must be understood the imprecation and threat of an angry and incensed
Master, unless Judas was to escape with impunity after so vast a sin. If he were meant to escape
with impunity, the “woe” was an idle word; if not, he was of course to be punished by
Him against whom he had committed the sin of treachery. Now, if He knowingly permitted
the man, whom He5095 deliberately elected to be one of His companions, to plunge into so
great a crime, you must no longer use an argument against the Creator in Adam’s case,
which may now recoil on your own God:5096 either that he was ignorant, and had no foresight
to hinder the future sinner;5097 or that he was unable to hinder him, even if he was ignorant;
5098 or else that he was unwilling, even if he had the foreknowledge and the ability; and
so deserved the stigma of maliciousness, in having permitted the man of his own choice to
perish in his sin. I advise you therefore (willingly) to acknowledge the Creator in that god
of yours, rather than against your will to be assimilating your excellent god to Him. For in
the case of Peter,5099 too, he gives you proof that he is a jealous God, when he destined the
apostle, after his presumptuous protestations of zeal, to a flat denial of him, rather than
prevent his fall.5100 The Christ of the prophets was destined, moreover, to be betrayed with
a kiss,5101 for He was the Son indeed of Him who was “honoured with the lips” by the
people.5102 When led before the council, He is asked whether He is the Christ.5103 Of what

Christ could the Jews have inquired5104 but their own? Why, therefore, did He not, even at
that moment, declare to them the rival (Christ)? You reply, In order that He might be able
to suffer. In other words, that this most excellent god might plunge men into crime, whom
he was still keeping in ignorance. But even if he had told them, he would yet have to suffer.
For he said, “If I tell you, ye will not believe.”5105 And refusing to believe, they would have
continued to insist on his death. And would he not even more probably still have had to
suffer, if had announced himself as sent by the rival god, and as being, therefore, the enemy
of the Creator? It was not, then, in order that He might suffer, that He at that critical moment
refrained from proclaiming5106 Himself the other Christ, but because they wanted to extort
a confession from His mouth, which they did not mean to believe even if He had given it
to them, whereas it was their bounden duty to have acknowledged Him in consequence of
His works, which were fulfilling their Scriptures. It was thus plainly His course to keep
Himself at that moment unrevealed,5107 because a spontaneous recognition was due to
Him. But yet for all this, He with a solemn gesture5108 says, “Hereafter shall the Son of man
sit on the right hand of the power of God.”5109 For it was on the authority of the prophecy
of Daniel that He intimated to them that He was “the Son of man,”5110 and of David’s Psalm,
that He would “sit at the right hand of God.”5111 Accordingly, after He had said this, and
so suggested a comparison of the Scripture, a ray of light did seem to show them whom He
would have them understand Him to be; for they say: “Art thou then the Son of God?”5112
Of what God, but of Him whom alone they knew? Of what God but of Him whom they re-
membered in the Psalm as having said to His Son, “Sit Thou on my right hand?” Then He
answered, “Ye say that I am;”5113 as if He meant: It is ye who say this—not I. But at the same
time He allowed Himself to be all that they had said, in this their second question.5114 By
what means, however, are you going to prove to us that they pronounced the sentence “Ergo
tu filius Dei es” interrogatively, and not affirmatively?5115 Just as, (on the one hand,) because

was His statement to this effect, that they insisted on accepting that sense which His statement
indicated.5120</p>

<p>For when He was brought before Pilate, they proceeded to urge Him with the serious
charge5121, of declaring Himself to be Christ the King;5122 that is, undoubtedly, as the Son
of God, who was to sit at God’s right hand. They would, however, have burdened Him5123
with some other title, if they had been uncertain whether He had called Himself the Son of
God—if He had not pronounced the words, “Ye say that I am,” so as (to admit) that He was
that which they said He was. Likewise, when Pirate asked Him, “Art thou Christ (the King)?”
He answered, as He had before (to the Jewish council)5124 “Thou sayest that I am”5125 in
order that He might not seem to have been driven by a fear of his power to give him a fuller
answer. “And so the Lord hath stood on His trial.”5126 And he placed His people on their
trial. The Lord Himself comes to a trial with “the elders and rulers of the people,” as Isaiah
predicted.5127 And then He fulfilled all that had been written of His passion. At that time
“the heathen raged, and the people imagined vain things; the kings of the earth set themselves,
and the rulers gathered themselves together against the Lord and against His Christ.”5128
The heathen were Pilate and the Romans; the people were the tribes of Israel; the kings were
represented in Herod, and the rulers in the chief priests. When, indeed, He was sent to Herod
gratuitously5129 by Pilate,5130 the words of Hosea were accomplished, for he had prophesied
of Christ: “And they shall carry Him bound as a present to the king.”5131 Herod was “exceeding
glad” when he saw Jesus, but he heard not a word from Him.5132 For, “as a lamb

to Him a disciplined tongue, that he might know how and when it behoved Him to
speak”5134—even that “tongue which clove to His jaws,” as the Psalm5135 said it should,
through His not speaking. Then Barabbas, the most abandoned criminal, is released, as if
he were the innocent man; while the most righteous Christ is delivered to be put to death,
as if he were the murderer.5136 Moreover two malefactors are crucified around Him, in order
that He might be reckoned amongst the transgressors.5137 Although His raiment was,
without doubt, parted among the soldiers, and partly distributed by lot, yet Marcion has
erased it all (from his Gospel),5138 for he had his eye upon the Psalm: “They parted my
garments amongst them, and cast lots upon my vesture.”5139 You may as well take away
the cross itself! But even then the Psalm is not silent concerning it: “They pierced my hands
and my feet.”5140 Indeed, the details of the whole event are therein read: “Dogs compassed
me about; the assembly of the wicked enclosed me around. All that looked upon me laughed
me to scorn; they did shoot out their lips and shake their heads, (saying,) He hoped in God,
let Him deliver Him.”5141 Of what use now is (your tampering with) the testimony of His
garments? If you take it as a booty for your false Christ, still all the Psalm (compensates)
the vesture of Christ.5142 But, behold, the very elements are shaken. For their Lord was
suffering. If, however, it was their enemy to whom all this injury was done, the heaven would
have gleamed with light, the sun would have been even more radiant, and the day would

These proofs5144 would still have been suitable for me, even if they had not been the subject
of prophecy. Isaiah says: “I will clothe the heavens with blackness.”5145 This will be the day,
concerning which Amos also writes: And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord,
that the sun shall go down at noon and the earth shall be dark in the clear day.”5146 (At
noon)5147 the veil of the temple was rent”5148 by the escape of the cherubim,5149 which “left
the daughter of Sion as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers.”5150
With what constancy has He also, in Psalm xxx., laboured to present to us the very Christ!
He calls with a loud voice to the Father, “Into Thine hands I commend my spirit,”5151 that
even when dying He might expend His last breath in fulfilling the prophets. Having said
this, He gave up the ghost.”5152 Who? Did the spirit5153 give itself up; or the flesh the
spirit? But the spirit could not have breathed itself out. That which breathes is one thing,
that which is breathed is another. If the spirit is breathed it must needs be breathed by another.
If, however, there had been nothing there but spirit, it would be said to have departed
rather than expired.5154 What, however, breathes out spirit but the flesh, which both breathes
the spirit whilst it has it, and breathes it out when it loses it? Indeed, if it was not flesh (upon
the cross), but a phantom5155 of flesh (and5156 a phantom is but spirit, and5157 so the spirit
breathed its own self out, and departed as it did so), no doubt the phantom departed, when
the spirit which was the phantom departed: and so the phantom and the spirit disappeared
together, and were nowhere to be seen.5158 Nothing therefore remained upon the cross,
nothing hung there, after “the giving up of the ghost;”5159 there was nothing to beg of Pilate,
nothing to take down from the cross, nothing to wrap in the linen, nothing to lay in the new

<head>Chapter XLIII.—Conclusions. Jesus as the Christ of the Creator Proved from the
Events of the Last Chapter of St. Luke. The Pious Women at the Sepulchre. The
Angels at the Resurrection. The Manifold Appearances of Christ After the Resurrection.
His Mission of the Apostles Amongst All Nations. All Shown to Be in

The Body of Christ After Death No Mere Phantom. Marcion’s Manipulation of
the Gospel on This Point.</head>
<p>It was very meet that the man who buried the Lord should thus be noticed in prophecy,
and thenceforth be “blessed;”5165 since prophecy does not omit the (pious) office of the
women who resorted before day-break to the sepulchre with the spices which they had pre
pared.5166 For of this incident it is said by Hosea: “To seek my face they will watch till daylight,
saying unto me, Come, and let us return to the Lord: for He hath taken away, and He
will heal us; He hath smitten, and He will bind us up; after two days will He revive us: in
the third day He will raise us up.”5167 For who can refuse to believe that these words often
revolved5168 in the thought of those women between the sorrow of that desertion with which
at present they seemed to themselves to have been smitten by the Lord, and the hope of the
resurrection itself, by which they rightly supposed that all would be restored to them? But
when “they found not the body (of the Lord Jesus),”5169 “His sepulture was removed from
the midst of them,”5170 according to the prophecy of Isaiah. “Two angels however, appeared
there.”5171 For just so many honorary companions5172 were required by the word of God,
which usually prescribes “two witnesses.”5173 Moreover, the women, returning from the
sepulchre, and from this vision of the angels, were foreseen by Isaiah, when he says, “Come,
ye women, who return from the vision;”5174 that is, “come,” to report the resurrection of
the Lord. It was well, however, that the unbelief of the disciples was so persistent, in order
that to the last we might consistently maintain that Jesus revealed Himself to the disciples
as none other than the Christ of the prophets. For as two of them were taking a walk, and

when the Lord had joined their company, without its appearing that it was He, and whilst
He dissembled His knowledge of what had just taken place,5175 they say: “But we trusted
that it had been He which should have redeemed Israel,”5176—meaning their own, that is,
the Creator’s Christ. So far had He been from declaring Himself to them as another Christ!
They could not, however, deem Him to be the Christ of the Creator; nor, if He was so deemed
by them, could He have tolerated this opinion concerning Himself, unless He were really
He whom He was supposed to be. Otherwise He would actually be the author of error, and
the prevaricator of truth, contrary to the character of the good God. But at no time even
after His resurrection did He reveal Himself to them as any other than what, on their own
showing, they had always thought Him to be. He pointedly5177 reproached them: “O fools,
and slow of heart in not believing that which He spake unto you.”5178 By saying this, He
proves that He does not belong to the rival god, but to the same God. For the same thing
was said by the angels to the women: “Remember how He spake unto you when He was yet
in Galilee, saying, The Son of man must be delivered up, and be crucified, and on the third
day rise again.”5179 “Must be delivered up;” and why, except that it was so written by God
the Creator? He therefore upbraided them, because they were offended solely at His passion,
and because they doubted of the truth of the resurrection which had been reported to them
by the women, whereby (they showed that) they had not believed Him to have been the very
same as they had thought Him to be. Wishing, therefore, to be believed by them in this wise,
He declared Himself to be just what they had deemed Him to be—the Creator’s Christ, the
Redeemer of Israel. But as touching the reality of His body, what can be plainer? When they
were doubting whether He were not a phantom—nay, were supposing that He was one—He
says to them, “Why are ye troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? See5180 my
hands and my feet, that it is I myself; for a spirit hath not bones, as ye see me have.”5181
Now Marcion was unwilling to expunge from his Gospel some statements which even made
against him—I suspect, on purpose, to have it in his power from the passages which he did
not suppress, when he could have done so, either to deny that he had expunged anything,
or else to justify his suppressions, if he made any. But he spares only such passages as he
can subvert quite as well by explaining them away as by expunging them from the text.

Thus, in the passage before us, he would have the words, “A spirit hath not bones, as ye see
me have,” so transposed, as to mean, “A spirit, such as ye see me to be, hath not bones;” that
is to say, it is not the nature of a spirit to have bones. But what need of so tortuous a construction,
when He might have simply said, “A spirit hath not bones, even as you observe
that I have not?” Why, moreover, does He offer His hands and His feet for their examination—
limbs which consist of bones—if He had no bones? Why, too, does He add, “Know
that it is I myself,”5182 when they had before known Him to be corporeal? Else, if He were
altogether a phantom, why did He upbraid them for supposing Him to be a phantom? But
whilst they still believed not, He asked them for some meat,5183 for the express purpose of
showing them that He had teeth.5184</p>
<p>And now, as I would venture to believe,5185 we have accomplished our undertaking.
We have set forth Jesus Christ as none other than the Christ of the Creator. Our proofs we
have drawn from His doctrines, maxims,5186 affections, feelings, miracles, sufferings, and
even resurrection—as foretold by the prophets.5187 Even to the last He taught us (the same
truth of His mission), when He sent forth His apostles to preach His gospel “among all nations;”
5188 for He thus fulfilled the psalm: “Their sound is gone out through all the earth,
and their words to the end of the world.”5189 Marcion, I pity you; your labour has been in

<head>Dr. Holmes’ Note.</head>
<p>Dr. Holmes appends the following as a note to the Fourth Book. (See cap. vi. p. 351.)</p>
<p>The following statement, abridged from Dr. Lardner (The History of Heretics, chap. x.
secs. 35–40), may be useful to the reader, in reference to the subject of the preceding
Book:—Marcion received but eleven books of the New Testament, and these strangely curtailed
and altered. He divided them into two parts, which he called τὸ Εὐαγγέλιον (the
Gospel) and τὸ ᾽Αποστολικόν (the Apostolicon).</p>
<p>1. The former contained nothing more than a mutilated, and sometimes interpolated,
edition of St. Luke; the name of that evangelist, however, he expunged from the beginning
of his copy. Chaps. i. and ii. he rejected entirely, and began at iii. 1, reading the opening
verse thus: “In the xv. year of Tiberius Cæsar, God descended into Capernaum, a city of
Galilee.”</p>
<p>2. According to Irenæus, Epiphanius, and Theodoret, he rejected the genealogy and
baptism of Christ; whilst from Tertullian’s statement (chap. vii.) it seems likely that he
connected what part of chap. iii.—vers. 1, 2—he chose to retain, with chap. iv. 31, at a leap.</p>
<p>3. He further eliminated the history of the temptation. That part of chap. iv. which
narrates Christ’s going into the synagogue at Nazareth and reading out of Isaiah he also rejected,
and all afterwards to the end of ver. 30.</p>
<p>4. Epiphanius mentions sundry slight alterations in capp. v. 14, 24, vi. 5, 17. In chap.
viii. 19 he expunged ἡ μήτηρ αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἀδελφοὶ αὐτοῦ. From Tertullian’s remarks (chap.
xix.), it would seem at first as if Marcion had added to his Gospel that answer of our Saviour
which we find related by St. Matthew, chap. xii. 48: “Who is my mother, and who are my
brethren?” For he represents Marcion (as in De carne Christi, vii., he represents other heretics,
who deny the nativity) as making use of these words for his favourite argument. But, after
all, Marcion might use these words against those who allowed the authenticity of Matthew’s
Gospel, without inserting them in his own Gospel; or else Tertullian might quote from
memory, and think that to be in Luke which was only in Matthew—as he has done at least
in three instances. (Lardner refers two of these instances to passages in chap. vii. of this
Book iv., where Tertullian mentions, as erasures from Luke, what really are found in Matthew
v. 17 and xv. 24. The third instance referred to by Lardner probably occurs at the end of
chap. ix. of this same Book iv., where Tertullian again mistakes Matt. v. 17 for a passage of
Luke, and charges Marcion with expunging it; curiously enough, the mistake recurs in chap.
xii of the same Book.) In Luke x. 21 Marcion omitted the first πάτερ and the words καὶ τῆς
γῆς, that he might not allow Christ to call His Father the Lord of earth, or of this world. The
second πατήρ in this verse, not open to any inconvenience, he retained. In chap. xi. 29 he
omitted the last words concerning the sign of the prophet Jonah; he also omitted all the

<pb n="928"/>
30th, 31st, and 32d; in ver. 42 he read κλῆσιν, ‘calling,’ instead of κρίσιν ‘judgment.’ He rejected
verses 49, 50, 51, because the passage related to the prophets. He entirely omitted
chap. xii. 6; whilst in ver. 8 he read ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Θεοῦ instead of ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ἀγγέλων
τοῦ Θεοῦ. He seems to have left out all the 28th verse, and expunged ὑμῶν from verses 30
and 32, reading only ὁ πατήρ. In ver. 38, instead of the words ἐν τῇ δευτέρᾳ φυλακῇ, καὶ
ἐν τῇ τρίτῃ φυλακῇ, he read ἐν τῇ ἑσπερινῇ φυλακῇ. In chap. xiii. he omitted the first five
verses, whilst in the 28th verse of the same chapter, where we read, “When ye shall see Abraham,
and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and ye yourselves
thrust out,” he read (by altering, adding, and transposing), “When ye shall see all the just
in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves cast out, and bound without, there shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth.” He likewise excluded all the remaining verses of this chapter.
All chap. xv. after the 10th verse, in which is contained the parable of the prodigal son, he
eliminated from his Gospel. In xvii. 10 he left out all the words after λέγετε. He made many
alterations in the story of the ten lepers; he left out part of ver. 12, all of ver. 13, and altered
ver. 14, reading thus: “There met Him ten lepers; and He sent them away, saying, Show
yourselves to the priest;” after which he inserted a clause from chap. iv. 27: “There were
many lepers in the days of Eliseus the prophet, but none of them were cleansed, but Naaman
the Syrian.” In chap. xviii. 19 he added the words ὁ πατήρ, and in ver. 20 altered οἶδας, thou
knowest, into the first person. He entirely omitted verses 31–33, in which our blessed Saviour
declares that the things foretold by the prophets concerning His sufferings, and death, and
resurrection, should all be fulfilled. He expunged nineteen verses out of chap. xix., from the
end of ver. 27 to the beginning of ver. 47. In chap. xx. he omitted ten verses, from the end
of ver. 8 to the end of ver. 18. He rejected also verses 37 and 38, in which there is a reference
to Moses. Marcion also erased of chap. xxi. the first eighteen verses, as well as verses 21 and
22, on account of this clause, “that all things which are written may be fulfilled;” xx. 16 was
left out by him, so also verses 35–37, 50, and 51 (and, adds Lardner, conjecturally, not herein
following his authority Epiphanius, also vers. 38 and 49). In chap. xxiii. 2, after the words
“perverting the nation,” Marcion added, “and destroying the law and the prophets;” and
again, after “forbidding to give tribute unto Cæsar,” he added, “and perverting women and
children.” He also erased ver. 43. In chap. xxiv. he omitted that part of the conference
between our Saviour and the two disciples going to Emmaus, which related to the prediction
of His sufferings, and which is contained in verses 26 and 27. These two verses he omitted,
and changed the words at the end of ver. 25, ἐλάλησαν οἱ προφῆται, into ἐλάλησα ὑμῖν.
Such are the alterations, according to Epiphanius, which Marcion made in his Gospel from
St. Luke. Tertullian says (in the 4th chapter of the preceding Book) that Marcion erased the
passage which gives an account of the parting of the raiment of our Saviour among the soldiers.
But the reason he assigns for the erasure—‘respiciens Psalmi prophetiam’—shows that
in this, as well as in the few other instances which we have already named, where Tertullian

<pb n="929"/>
has charged Marcion with so altering passages, his memory deceived him into mistaking
Matthew for Luke, for the reference to the passage in the Psalm is only given by St. Matthew
xxvii. 35.</p>
<p>5. On an impartial review of these alterations, some seem to be but slight; others might
be nothing but various readings; but others, again, are undoubtedly designed perversions.
There were, however, passages enough left unaltered and unexpunged by the Marcionites,
to establish the reality of the flesh and blood of Christ, and to prove that the God of the Jews
was the Father of Christ, and of perfect goodness as well as justice. Tertullian, indeed, observes
(chap. xliii.) that “Marcion purposely avoided erasing all the passages which made against
him, that he might with the greater confidence deny having erased any at all, or at least that
what he had omitted was for very good reasons.”</p>
<p>6. To show the unauthorized and unwarrantable character of these alterations, omissions,
additions, and corruptions, the Catholic Christians asserted that their copies of St. Luke’s
Gospel were more ancient than Marcion’s (so Tertullian in chap. iii. and iv. of this Book
iv.); and they maintained also the genuineness and integrity of the unadulterated Gospel,
in opposition to that which had been curtailed and altered by him (chap. v.).</p>

<head>Elucidations.</head>

<p>I.
(Deadly Sins, cap. ix., p. 356.)</p>
<p>To maintain a modern and wholly uncatholic system of Penitence, the schoolmen invented
a technical scheme of sins mortal and sins venial, which must not be read into the
Fathers, who had no such technicalities in mind. By “deadly sins” they meant all such as St.
John recognizes (1 John v. 16–17) and none other; that is to say sins of surprise and infirmity,
sins having in them no malice or wilful disobedience, such as an impatient word, or a momentary
neglect of duty. Should a dying man commit a deliberate sin and then expire, even
after a life of love and obedience, who could fail to recognize the fearful nature of such an
end? But, should his last word be one of infirmity and weakness, censurable but not involving
wilful disobedience, surely we may consider it as provided for by the comfortable
words—“there is a sin not unto death.” Yet “all unrighteousness is sin,” and the Fathers held
that all sin should be repented of and confessed before God; because all sin when it is finished
bringeth forth death.”</p>
<p>In St. Augustine’s time, when moral theology became systematized in the West, by his
mighty genius and influence, the following were recognized degrees of guilt: (1.) Sins deserving
excommunication. (2.) Sins requiring to be confessed to the brother offended in
order to God’s forgiveness, and (3.) sins covered by God’s gracious covenant, when daily
confessed in the Lord’s Prayer, in public, or in private. And this classification was professedly
based on Holy Scripture. Thus: (1.) on the text—“To deliver such an one unto Satan, etc.”
(1 Cor. v. 4–5). (2.) On the text—(Matt. xviii. 15), “Confess your sins one to another,
brethren” (James v. 16), and (3.) on the text—(Matt. vi. 12) “Forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive them that trespass against us.” This last St. Augustine5190 regards as the “daily
medication” of our ordinary life, habitual penitence and faith and the baptismal covenant
being presupposed.</p>
<p>The modern Trent theology has vastly amplified the scholastic teachings and refinements,
and the elevation of Liguori to the rank of a church-doctor has virtually made the whole
system de fide with the Latins. The Easterns know nothing of this modern and uncatholic
teaching, and it is important that the student of the Ante-Nicene Patrologia should be on
his guard against the novel meanings which the Trent theology imposes upon orthodox
<note type="footnote">5190 Opp. Tom. vi. p. 228. Ed. Migne.</note>

<pb n="931"/>
(Nicene) language. The long ages during which Eastern orthodoxy has been obscured by
the sufferings and consequent ignorance of the Greeks, have indeed tainted their doctrinal
and practical system, but it still subsists in amazing contrast with Latin impurity. See, on
the “indulgences,” of the latter, the “Orthodox Theology of Macarius, Bishop of Vinnitza,”
Tom. II. p. 541, Paris, 1860.</p>

<pb n="931"/>
<p>II.
(Reservation of Baptism, cap. xi., note, p. 361.)</p>
<p>It is important, here, to observe the heretical origin of a sinful superstition which becomes
conspicuous in the history of Constantine. If the church tolerated it in his case, it was
doubtless in view of this extraordinary instance of one, who was a heathen still, at heart,
becoming a guardian and protector of the persecuted Faithful. It is probable that he was
regarded as a Cyrus or a Nebuchadnezzar whom God had raised up to protect and to deliver
His people; who was to be honoured and obeyed as “God’s minister” (Rom. xiii. 4.) in so
far, and for this purpose. The church was scrupulous and he was superstitious; it would
have been difficult to discipline him and worse not to discipline him. Tacitly, therefore, he
was treated as a catechumen, but was not formally admitted even to that class. He permitted
Heathenism, and while he did so, how could he be received as a Christian? The Christian
church never became responsible for his life and character, but strove to reform him and
to prepare him for a true confession of Christ at some “convenient season.” In this, there
seems to have been a great fault somewhere, chargeable perhaps to Eusebius or to some
other Christian counsellor; but, when could any one say—“the emperor is sincere and
humble and penitent and ought now to be received into the church.” It was a political conversion,
and as such was accepted, and Constantine was a heathen till near his death. As to
his final penitence and acceptance—“Forbear to judge.” 2 Kings x. 29–31. Concerning his
baptism, see Eusebius, de Vita Const. iv. 61, see also, Mosheim’s elaborate and candid views
of the whole subject: First Three Centuries, Vol. II. 460–471.</p>

<p>III.
(Peter, cap. xiii. p. 365.)</p>
<p>The great Gallican, Launoy, doctor of the Sorbonne, has proved that the Fathers understand
the Rock to be Christ, while, only rarely, and that rhetorically, not dogmatically, St.
Peter is called a stone or a rock; a usage to which neither Luther nor Calvin could object.
Tertullian himself, when he speaks dogmatically, is in accord with other Fathers, and gives
no countenance to the modern doctrine of Rome. See La Papauté, of the Abbé Guettée, pp.
42–61. It is important, also, to note that the primacy of St. Peter, more or less, whatever it
Elucidations.
may have been in the mind of the Fathers, was wholly personal, in their view. Of the fables
which make it hereditary and a purtenance of Rome they knew nothing.</p>

<pb n="932"/>
 <p>IV.
(Loans, cap. xvii. p. 372.)</p>
<p>The whole subject of usury, in what it consists, etc., deserves to receive more attention
than it does in our times, when nominal Christians are steeped in the sin of money-traffic
to the injury of neighbours, on a scale truly gigantic. God’s word clearly rebukes this sin.
So does the Council of Nice.5191 Now by what is the sin defined? Certainly by the spirit of
the Gospel; but, is it also, by the letter? A sophistical casuistry which maintains the letter,
and then sophisticates and refines so as to explain it all away, is the product of school divinity
and of modern Jesuitry; but even the great Bossuet is its apologist. (See his Traité de l’Usure.
opp. ix. p. 49, etc., ed. Paris, 1846.) But for an exhaustive review of the whole matter, I ask
attention to Huet, Le Règne Social, etc. (Paris, 1853) pp. 334–345.</p>

<p>V.
(The Baptist, cap. xviii. p. 375.)</p>
<p>The interpretation of Tertullian, however, has the all-important merit (which Bacon
and Hooker recognize as cardinal) of flowing from the Scripture without squeezing. (1.)
Our Lord sent the message to John as a personal and tender assurance to him. (2.) The story
illustrates the decrease of which the Baptist had spoken prophetically (John iii. 30.); and (3.)
it sustains the great principle that Christ alone is without sin, this being the one fault recorded
of the Baptist, otherwise a singular instance of sinlessness. The B. Virgin’s fault (gently reproved
by the Lord, John ii. 4.), seems in like manner introduced on this principle of exhibiting
the only sinless One, in His Divine perfections as without spot. So even Joseph and
Moses (Psalm cvi. 33., and Gen. xlvii. 20.) are shewn “to be but men.” The policy of Joseph
has indeed been extravagantly censured.</p>

<p>VI.
(Harshness, cap. xix., note 6., p. 378. Also, cap. xxvi. p. 393.)</p>
<p>Tertullian seems with reflect the early view of the church as to our Lord’s total abnegation
of all filial relations with the Virgin, when He gave to her St. John, instead of Himself, on
the Cross. For this purpose He had made him the beloved disciple and doubtless charged
<note type="footnote">5191 Calmet. Opp. i. 483 and Tom. x., p. 525.</note>

<pb n="933"/>
him with all the duties with which he was to be clothed. Thus He fulfilled the figurative law
of His priesthood, as given by Moses, (Deut. xxxiii. 9.) and crucified himself, from the beginning,
according to his own Law (Luke xiv. 26–27.) which he identifies with the Cross,
here and also in Matt. x. 37–38. These then are the steps of His own holy example, illustrating
His own precept, for doubtless, as “the Son of man,” His filial love was superlative and made
the sacrifice the sharper: (1.) He taught Joseph that He had no earthly father, when he
said—“Wist ye not that I must be in my Father’s house,” (Luke iii. 49., Revised); but, having
established this fact, he then became “subject” to both his parents, till His public ministry
began. (2.) At this time, He seems to have admonished His mother, that He could not recognize
her authority any longer, (John ii. 4.) having now entered upon His work as the Son of
God. (3.) Accordingly, He refused, thenceforth, to know her save only as one of His redeemed,
excepting her in nothing from this common work for all the Human Race, (Matt. xii. 48)
in the passage which Tertullian so forcibly expounds. (4.) Finally, when St. Mary draws near
to the cross, apparently to claim the final recognition of the previous understanding (John
ii. 4.) to which the Lord had referred her at Cana—He fulfils His last duty to her in giving
her a son instead of Himself, and thereafter (5) recognizes her no more; not even in His
messages after the Resurrection, nor when He met her with other disciples. He rewards her,
instead, with the infinite love He bears to all His saints, and with the brightest rewards which
are bestowed upon Faith. In this consists her superlative excellence and her conspicuous
glory among the Redeemed (Luke i. 47–48.) in Christ’s account.</p>

<p>VII.
(Children, cap. xxiii. p. 386.)</p>
<p>In this beautiful testimony of our author to the sanctity of marriage, and the blessedness
of its fruits, I see his austere spirit reflecting the spirit of Christ so tenderly and so faithfully,
in the love of children, that I am warmly drawn to him. I cannot give him up to Montanism
at this period of his life and labours. Surely, he was as yet merely persuaded that the
prophetic charismata were not extinct, and that they had been received by his Phrygian
friends, although he may still have regarded them as prophesying subject to all the infirmities
which St. Paul attributes even to persons elevated by spiritual gifts. (1 Cor. xiv.) Why not
recognize him in all his merits, until his open and senile lapse is complete?</p>

<p>VIII.
(Hades, cap. xxxiv. p. 406.)</p>
<p>Here again our author shews his unsettled view as to Sheol or Hades, on which see Kaye,
pp. 247–250. Here he distinguishes between the Inferi and Abraham’s bosom; but (in B. iii.

<pb n="934"/>
cap. 24.) he has already, more aptly, regarded the Inferi, or Hades, as the common receptacle
of departed spirits, where a “great gulf” indeed, separates between the two classes.</p>
<p>A caricature may sometimes illustrate characteristic features more powerfully than a
true portrait. The French call the highest gallery in theatres, paradis; and I have sometimes
explained it by the fact that the modern drama originated in the monkish Mysteries, revived
so profanely in our own day. To reconcile the poor to a bad place they gave it the name of
Paradise, thus illustrating their Mediæval conceptions; for trickling down from Tertullian
his vivid notions seem to have suffused all Western theology on this subject. Thus, then,
one vast receptacle receives all the dead. The pit, as we very appropriately call it in English,
answers to the place of lost spirits, where the rich man was in torments. Above, are ranged
the family of Abraham reclining, as it were, in their father’s bosom, by turns. Far above,
under skylights, (for the old Mysteries were celebrated in the day-time) is the Paradise,
where the Martyrs see God, and are represented as “under the altar” of heaven itself. Now,
abandoning our grotesque illustration, but using it for its topography, let us conceive of our
own globe, as having a world-wide concavity such as they imagined, from literalizing the
under-world of Sheol. In its depths is the Phylace (1 Peter iii. 19.) of “spirits in prison.” In a
higher region repose the blessed spirits in “Abraham’s bosom.” Yet nearer to the ethereal
vaults, are the martyrs in Paradise, looking out into heavenly worlds. The immensity of the
scale does not interfere with the vision of spirits, nor with such communications as Abraham
holds with his lost son in the history of Dives and Lazarus. Here indeed Science comes to
our aid, for if the telephone permits such conversations while we are in the flesh, we may at
least imagine that the subtile spirit can act in like manner, apart from such contrivances.
Now, so far as Tertullian is consistent with himself, I think these explanations may clarify
his words and references. The Eastern Theology is less inconsistent and bears the marks
alike of Plato and of Origen. But of this hereafter. Of a place, such as the Mediæval Purgatory,
affirmed as de fide by the Trent creed, the Fathers knew nothing at all. See Vol. II. p. 490,

<p>Wherein Tertullian proves, with respect to St. Paul’s epistles, what
he had proved in the preceding book with respect to St. Luke’s gospel.
Far from being at variance, they were in perfect unison with the writings
of the Old Testament, and therefore testified that the Creator was
the only God, and that the Lord Jesus was his Christ. As in the preceding
books, Tertullian supports his argument with profound reasoning,
and many happy illustrations of Holy Scripture.</p>

in the treatment of them, if a clear knowledge is to be arrived at concerning their condition;

<note type="footnote">5194 We have already more than once referred to Marcion’s preference for St. Paul. “The reason of the preference
thus given to that apostle was his constant and strenuous opposition to the Judaizing Christians, who
wished to reimpose the yoke of the Jewish ceremonies on the necks of their brethren. This opposition the
Marcionites wished to construe into a direct denial of the authority of the Mosaic law. They contended also
from St. Paul’s assertion, that he received his appointment to the apostolic office not from man, but from Christ,
that he alone delivered the genuine doctrines of the gospel. This deference for St. Paul accounts also for Marcion’s
accepting St. Luke’s Gospel as the only authentic one, as we saw in the last book of this treatise; it was because
that evangelist had been the companion of St. Paul” (Bp. Kaye, On the Writings of Tertullian, 3d edition, pp.

master; who at the same time5196 can believe nothing, except that nothing ought to be believed
hastily5197 (and that I may further say is hastily believed, which is believed without
any examination5198 of its beginning); in short, I who have the best reason possible for
bringing this inquiry to a most careful solution,5199 since a man is affirmed to me to be an
apostle whom I do not find mentioned in the Gospel in the catalogue5200 of the apostles.
Indeed, when I hear that this man was chosen by the Lord after He had attained His rest in
heaven, I feel that a kind of improvidence is imputable to Christ, for not knowing before
that this man was necessary to Him; and because He thought that he must be added to the
apostolic body in the way of a fortuitous encounter5201 rather than a deliberate selection;
by necessity (so to speak), and not voluntary choice, although the members of the apostolate
had been duly ordained, and were now dismissed to their several missions. Wherefore, O
shipmaster of Pontus,5202 if you have never taken on board your small craft5203 any contraband

belong to him,5209 who can substantiate his claim to him by producing all his apostolic

himself; but his profession is only rendered valid by the authority of a second person. One
man signs, another countersigns;5212 one man appends his seal, another registers in the
public records.5213 No one is at once a proposer and a seconder to himself. Besides, you
have read, no doubt, that “many shall come, saying, I am Christ.”5214 Now if any one can
pretend that he is Christ, how much more might a man profess to be an apostle of Christ!
But still, for my own part, I appear5215 in the character of a disciple and an inquirer; that
so I may even thus5216 both refute your belief, who have nothing to support it, and confound
your shamelessness, who make claims without possessing the means of establishing them.
Let there be a Christ, let there be an apostle, although of another god; but what matter? since
they are only to draw their proofs out of the Testament of the Creator. Because even the
book of Genesis so long ago promised me the Apostle Paul. For among the types and
prophetic blessings which he pronounced over his sons, Jacob, when he turned his attention
to Benjamin, exclaimed, “Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf; in the morning he shall devour the
prey, and at night he shall impart nourishment.”5217 He foresaw that Paul would arise out
of the tribe of Benjamin, a voracious wolf, devouring his prey in the morning: in order
words, in the early period of his life he would devastate the Lord’s sheep, as a persecutor of
the churches; but in the evening he would give them nourishment, which means that in his
declining years he would educate the fold of Christ, as the teacher of the Gentiles. Then,
again, in Saul’s conduct towards David, exhibited first in violent persecution of him, and
then in remorse and reparation,5218 on his receiving from him good for evil, we have
nothing else than an anticipation5219 of Paul in Saul—belonging, too, as they did, to the
same tribe—and of Jesus in David, from whom He descended according to the Virgin’s
genealogy.5220 Should you, however, disapprove of these types,5221 the Acts of the
Apostles,5222 at all events, have handed down to me this career of Paul, which you must not

of men, neither by man;”5223 thence am I led to believe the Apostle himself; thence do I find
reason for rejecting your defence of him,5224 and for bearing fearlessly your taunt. “Then

what you believe, or failing in your proof, (tell us) how you believe. Else what conduct is
yours,5227 believing in opposition to Him from whom alone comes the proof of that which
you believe? Take now from my point of view5228 the apostle, in the same manner as you
have received the Christ—the apostle shown to be as much mine as the Christ is. And here,
too, we will fight within the same lines, and challenge our adversary on the mere ground of
a simple rule,5229 that even an apostle who is said not to belong to the Creator—nay, is
displayed as in actual hostility to the Creator—can be fairly regarded as teaching5230 nothing,
knowing nothing, wishing nothing in favour of the Creator whilst it would be a first principle
with him to set forth5231 another god with as much eagerness as he would use in withdrawing
us from the law of the Creator. It is not at all likely that he would call men away from Judaism
without showing them at the same time what was the god in whom he invited them to believe;
because nobody could possibly pass from allegiance to the Creator without knowing to
whom he had to cross over. For either Christ had already revealed another god—in which
case the apostle’s testimony would also follow to the same effect, for fear of his not being
<note type="footnote">from the more ancient authority of Tertullian, who begins his Book v. against Marcion with showing the absurdity
of his conduct in rejecting the history and acts of the apostles, and yet receiving St. Paul as the chief of the
apostles, whose name is never mentioned in the Gospel with the other apostles, especially since the account
given by Paul himself in Gal. i.–ii. confirms the account which we have in the Acts. But the reason why he rejected
this book is (as Tertullian says) very evident, since from it we can plainly show that the God of the Christians
and the God of the Jews, or the Creator, was the same being and that Christ was sent by Him, and by no other”

else regarded5232 as an apostle of the god whom Christ had revealed, and because of the
impropriety of his being concealed by the apostle who had been already revealed by
Christ—or Christ had made no such revelation concerning God; then there was all the
greater need why the apostle should reveal a God who could now be made known by no
one else, and who would undoubtedly be left without any belief at all, if he were revealed
not even by an apostle. We have laid down this as our first principle, because we wish at
once to profess that we shall pursue the same method here in the apostle’s case as we adopted
before in Christ’s case, to prove that he proclaimed no new god;5233 that is, we shall draw
our evidence from the epistles of St. Paul himself. Now, the garbled form in which we have
found the heretic’s Gospel will have already prepared us to expect to find5234 the epistles
also mutilated by him with like perverseness—and that even as respects their number.5235</p>

<head>Chapter II.—On the Epistle to the Galatians. The Abolition of the Ordinances of the
Mosaic Law No Proof of Another God. The Divine Lawgiver, the Creator Himself,
Was the Abrogator. The Apostle’s Doctrine in the First Chapter Shown to Accord
with the Teaching of the Old Testament. The Acts of the Apostles Shown to Be
Genuine Against Marcion. This Book Agrees with the Pauline Epistles.</head>
<p>The epistle which we also allow to be the most decisive5236 against Judaism, is that
wherein the apostle instructs the Galatians. For the abolition of the ancient law we fully
admit, and hold that it actually proceeds from the dispensation of the Creator,—a point
which we have already often treated in the course of our discussion, when we showed that
the innovation was foretold by the prophets of our God.5237 Now, if the Creator indeed
promised that “the ancient things should pass away,”5238 to be superseded by a new course
of things which should arise, whilst Christ marks the period of the separation when He says,
“The law and the prophets were until John”5239—thus making the Baptist the limit between
the two dispensations of the old things then terminating—and the new things then beginning,
the apostle cannot of course do otherwise, (coming as he does) in Christ, who was revealed
after John, than invalidate “the old things” and confirm “the new,” and yet promote thereby
the faith of no other god than the Creator, at whose instance5240 it was foretold that the
ancient things should pass away. Therefore both the abrogation of the law and the establishment
of the gospel help my argument even in this epistle, wherein they both have reference
to the fond assumption of the Galatians, which led them to suppose that faith in Christ (the
Creator’s Christ, of course) was obligatory, but without annulling the law, because it still
appeared to them a thing incredible that the law should be set aside by its own author.
Again,5241 if they had at all heard of any other god from the apostle, would they not have
concluded at once, of themselves, that they must give up the law of that God whom they
had left, in order to follow another? For what man would be long in learning, that he ought
to pursue a new discipline, after he had taken up with a new god? Since, however,5242 the
same God was declared in the gospel which had always been so well known in the law, the
only change being in the dispensation,5243 the sole point of the question to be discussed

was, whether the law of the Creator ought by the gospel to be excluded in the Christ of the
Creator? Take away this point, and the controversy falls to the ground. Now, since they
would all know of themselves,5244 on the withdrawal of this point, that they must of course
renounce all submission to the Creator by reason of their faith in another god, there could
have been no call for the apostle to teach them so earnestly that which their own belief must
have spontaneously suggested to them. Therefore the entire purport of this epistle is simply
to show us that the supersession5245 of the law comes from the appointment of the Creator—a
point, which we shall still have to keep in mind.5246 Since also he makes mention of no
other god (and he could have found no other opportunity of doing so, more suitable than
when his purpose was to set forth the reason for the abolition of the law—especially as the
prescription of a new god would have afforded a singularly good and most sufficient reason),
it is clear enough in what sense he writes, “I marvel that ye are so soon removed from Him
who hath called you to His grace to another gospel”5247—He means) “another” as to the
conduct it prescribes, not in respect of its worship; “another” as to the discipline it teaches,
not in respect of its divinity; because it is the office of5248 Christ’s gospel to call men from
the law to grace, not from the Creator to another god. For nobody had induced them to
apostatize from5249 the Creator, that they should seem to “be removed to another gospel,”
simply when they return again to the Creator. When he adds, too, the words, “which is not
another,”5250 he confirms the fact that the gospel which he maintains is the Creator’s. For
the Creator Himself promises the gospel, when He says by Isaiah: “Get thee up into the high
mountain, thou that bringest to Sion good tidings; lift up thy voice with strength, thou that
bringest the gospel to Jerusalem.”5251 Also when, with respect to the apostles personally,
He says, “How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, that bring good
tidings of good”5252—even proclaiming the gospel to the Gentiles, because He also says, “In
His name shall the Gentiles trust;”5253 that is, in the name of Christ, to whom He says, “I

have given thee as a light of the Gentiles.”5254 However, you will have it that it is the gospel
of a new god which was then set forth by the apostle. So that there are two gospels for5255
two gods; and the apostle made a great mistake when he said that “there is not another”
gospel,5256 since there is (on the hypothesis)5257 another; and so he might have made a
better defence of his gospel, by rather demonstrating this, than by insisting on its being but
one. But perhaps, to avoid this difficulty, you will say that he therefore added just afterwards,
“Though an angel from heaven preach any other gospel, let him be accursed,”5258 because
he was aware that the Creator was going to introduce a gospel! But you thus entangle
yourself still more. For this is now the mesh in which you are caught. To affirm that there
are two gospels, is not the part of a man who has already denied that there is another. His
meaning, however, is clear, for he has mentioned himself first (in the anathema): “But though
we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel.”5259 It is by way of an example that
he has expressed himself. If even he himself might not preach any other gospel, then neither
might an angel. He said “angel” in this way, that he might show how much more men ought
not to be believed, when neither an angel nor an apostle ought to be; not that he meant to
apply5260 an angel to the gospel of the Creator. He then cursorily touches on his own conversion
from a persecutor to an apostle—confirming thereby the Acts of the Apostles,5261
in which book may be found the very subject5262 of this epistle, how that certain persons
interposed, and said that men ought to be circumcised, and that the law of Moses was to be
observed; and how the apostles, when consulted, determined, by the authority of the Holy
Ghost, that “a yoke should not be put upon men’s necks which their fathers even had not
been able to bear.”5263 Now, since the Acts of the Apostles thus agree with Paul, it becomes
apparent why you reject them. It is because they declare no other God than the Creator,
and prove Christ to belong to no other God than the Creator; whilst the promise of the Holy
Ghost is shown to have been fulfilled in no other document than the Acts of the Apostles.

Teaching is Shown to Be in Keeping with the Law and the Prophets. Marcion’s

<p>But with regard to the countenance5268 of Peter and the rest of the apostles, he tells
us5269 that “fourteen years after he went up to Jerusalem,” in order to confer with them5270
about the rule which he followed in his gospel, lest perchance he should all those years have
been running, and be running still, in vain, (which would be the case,) of course, if his
preaching of the gospel fell short of their method.5271 So great had been his desire to be
approved and supported by those whom you wish on all occasions5272 to be understood as
in alliance with Judaism! When indeed he says, that “neither was Titus circumcised,”5273
he for the first time shows us that circumcision was the only question connected with the
maintenance5274 of the law, which had been as yet agitated by those whom he therefore
calls “false brethren unawares brought in.”5275 These persons went no further than to insist
on a continuance of the law, retaining unquestionably a sincere belief in the Creator. They
perverted the gospel in their teaching, not indeed by such a tampering with the Scripture5276
as should enable them to expunge5277 the Creator’s Christ, but by so retaining the ancient
régime as not to exclude the Creator’s law. Therefore he says: “Because of false brethren
unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ,
that they might bring us into bondage, to whom we gave place by subjection not even for
an hour.”5278 Let us only attend to the clear5279 sense and to the reason of the thing, and
the perversion of the Scripture will be apparent. When he first says, “Neither Titus, who

because of false brethren unawares brought in,”5280 etc., he gives us an insight into his
reason5281 for acting in a clean contrary way,5282 showing us wherefore he did that which
he would neither have done nor shown to us, if that had not happened which induced him
to act as he did. But then5283 I want you to tell us whether they would have yielded to the
subjection that was demanded,5284 if these false brethren had not crept in to spy out their
liberty? I apprehend not. They therefore gave way (in a partial concession), because there
were persons whose weak faith required consideration.5285 For their rudimentary belief,
which was still in suspense about the observance of the law, deserved this concessive treatment,
5286 when even the apostle himself had some suspicion that he might have run, and
be still running, in vain.5287 Accordingly, the false brethren who were the spies of their
Christian liberty must be thwarted in their efforts to bring it under the yoke of their own
Judaism before that Paul discovered whether his labour had been in vain, before that those
who preceded him in the apostolate gave him their right hands of fellowship, before that he
entered on the office of preaching to the Gentiles, according to their arrangement with
him.5288 He therefore made some concession, as was necessary, for a time; and this was the
reason why he had Timothy circumcised,5289 and the Nazarites introduced into the

<note type="footnote">5286 The following statement will throw light upon the character of the two classes of Jewish professors of
Christianity referred to by Tertullian: “A pharisaic section was sheltered in its bosom (of the church at Jerusalem),
which continually strove to turn Christianity into a sect of Judaism. These men were restless agitators, animated
by the bitterest sectarian spirit; and although they were numerically a small party, yet we know the power of the
turbulent minority. But besides these Judaizing zealots, there was a large proportion of the Christians at Jerusalem,
whose Christianity, though more sincere than that of those just mentioned, was yet very weak and imperfect…
Many of them still only knew of a Christ after the flesh—a Saviour of Israel—a Jewish Messiah. Their
minds were in a state of transition between the law and the gospel; and it was of great consequence not to shock
their prejudices too rudely; lest they should be tempted to make shipwreck of their faith and renounce their
Christianity altogether.” These were they whose prejudices required to be wisely consulted in things which did
not touch the foundation of the gospel. (Conybeare and Howson’s St. Paul, People’s Edition, vol. ii. pp. 259,

temple,5290 which incidents are described in the Acts. Their truth may be inferred from
their agreement with the apostle’s own profession, how “to the Jews he became as a Jew,
that he might gain the Jews, and to them that were under the law, as under the law,”—and
so here with respect to those who come in secretly,—“and lastly, how he became all things
to all men, that he might gain all.”5291 Now, inasmuch as the circumstances require such
an interpretation as this, no one will refuse to admit that Paul preached that God and that
Christ whose law he was excluding all the while, however much he allowed it, owing to the
times, but which he would have had summarily to abolish if he had published a new god.
Rightly, then, did Peter and James and John give their right hand of fellowship to Paul, and
agree on such a division of their work, as that Paul should go to the heathen, and themselves
to the circumcision.5292 Their agreement, also, “to remember the poor”5293 was in complete
conformity with the law of the Creator, which cherished the poor and needy, as has been
shown in our observations on your Gospel.5294 It is thus certain that the question was one
which simply regarded the law, while at the same time it is apparent what portion of the law
it was convenient to have observed. Paul, however, censures Peter for not walking straightforwardly
according to the truth of the gospel. No doubt he blames him; but it was solely
because of his inconsistency in the matter of “eating,”5295 which he varied according to the
sort of persons (whom he associated with) “fearing them which were of the circumcision,”5296
but not on account of any perverse opinion touching another god. For if such a question
had arisen, others also would have been “resisted face to face” by the man who had not even
spared Peter on the comparatively small matter of his doubtful conversation. But what do
the Marcionites wish to have believed (on the point)? For the rest, the apostle must (be
permitted to) go on with his own statement, wherein he says that “a man is not justified by
the works of the law, but by faith:”5297 faith, however, in the same God to whom belongs
the law also. For of course he would have bestowed no labour on severing faith from the
law, when the difference of the god would, if there had only been any, have of itself produced
such a severance. Justly, therefore, did he refuse to “build up again (the structure of the law)
which he had overthrown.”5298 The law, indeed, had to be overthrown, from the moment

when John “cried in the wilderness, Prepare ye the ways of the Lord,” that valleys5299 and
hills and mountains may be filled up and levelled, and the crooked and the rough ways be
made straight and smooth5300—in other words, that the difficulties of the law might be
changed into the facilities of the gospel.</p>
<p>For he remembered that the time was come of which the Psalm spake, “Let us break
their bands asunder, and cast off their yoke from us;”5301 since the time when “the nations
became tumultuous, and the people imagined vain counsels;” when “the kings of the earth
stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against His Christ,”5302
in order that thenceforward man might be justified by the liberty of faith, not by servitude
to the law,5303 “because the just shall live by his faith.”5304 Now, although the prophet
Habakkuk first said this, yet you have the apostle here confirming the prophets, even as
Christ did. The object, therefore, of the faith whereby the just man shall live, will be that
same God to whom likewise belongs the law, by doing which no man is justified. Since,
then, there equally are found the curse in the law and the blessing in faith, you have both
conditions set forth by5305 the Creator: “Behold,” says He, “I have set before you a blessing
and a curse.”5306 You cannot establish a diversity of authors because there happens to be
one of things; for the diversity is itself proposed by one and the same author. Why, however,
“Christ was made a curse for us,”5307 is declared by the apostle himself in a way which quite
helps our side, as being the result of the Creator’s appointment. But yet it by no means
follows, because the Creator said of old, “Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree,”5308
that Christ belonged to another god, and on that account was accursed even then in the law.
And how, indeed, could the Creator have cursed by anticipation one whom He knew not
of? Why, however, may it not be more suitable for the Creator to have delivered His own
Son to His own curse, than to have submitted Him to the malediction of that god of
yours,—in behalf, too, of man, who is an alien to him? Now, if this appointment of the
Creator respecting His Son appears to you to be a cruel one, it is equally so in the case of

your own god; if, on the contrary, it be in accordance with reason in your god, it is equally
so—nay, much more so—in mine. For it would be more credible that that God had provided
blessing for man, through the curse of Christ, who formerly set both a blessing and a curse
before man, than that he had done so, who, according to you,5309 never at any time pronounced
either. “We have received therefore, the promise of the Spirit,” as the apostle says,
“through faith,” even that faith by which the just man lives, in accordance with the Creator’s
purpose.5310 What I say, then, is this, that that God is the object of faith who prefigured the
grace of faith. But when he also adds, “For ye are all the children of faith,”5311 it becomes
clear that what the heretic’s industry erased was the mention of Abraham’s name; for by
faith the apostle declares us to be “children of Abraham,”5312 and after mentioning him he
expressly called us “children of faith” also. But how are we children of faith? and of whose
faith, if not Abraham’s? For since “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for
righteousness;”5313 since, also, he deserved for that reason to be called “the father of many
nations,” whilst we, who are even more like him5314 in believing in God, are thereby justified
as Abraham was, and thereby also obtain life—since the just lives by his faith,—it therefore
happens that, as he in the previous passage called us “sons of Abraham,” since he is in faith
our (common) father,5315 so here also he named us “children of faith,” for it was owing to
his faith that it was promised that Abraham should be the father of (many) nations. As to
the fact itself of his calling off faith from circumcision, did he not seek thereby to constitute
us the children of Abraham, who had believed previous to his circumcision in the flesh?5316
In short,5317 faith in one of two gods cannot possibly admit us to the dispensation5318 of
the other,5319 so that it should impute righteousness to those who believe in him, and make
the just live through him, and declare the Gentiles to be his children through faith. Such a
dispensation as this belongs wholly to Him through whose appointment it was already made

<p>“But,” says he, “I speak after the manner of men: when we were children, we were placed
in bondage under the elements of the world.”5322 This, however, was not said “after the
manner of men.” For there is no figure5323 here, but literal truth. For (with respect to the
latter clause of this passage), what child (in the sense, that is, in which the Gentiles are
children) is not in bondage to the elements of the world, which he looks up to5324 in the
light of a god? With regard, however, to the former clause, there was a figure (as the apostle
wrote it); because after he had said, “I speak after the manner of men,” he adds), “Though
it be but a man’s covenant, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.”5325 For by the figure
of the permanency of a human covenant he was defending the divine testament. “To Abraham
were the promises made, and to his seed. He said not ‘to seeds,’ as of many; but as of one,
‘to thy seed,’ which is Christ.”5326 Fie on5327 Marcion’s sponge! But indeed it is superfluous
to dwell on what he has erased, when he may be more effectually confuted from that which
he has retained.5328 “But when the fulness of time was come, God sent forth His

Junius). “If I may be allowed to guess from the manner in which Tertullian expresseth himself, I should imagine
that Marcion erased the whole of chap. iii. after the word λέγω in ver. 15, and the beginning of chap. iv., until
you come to the word ὅτε in ver. 3. Then the words will be connected thus: ‘Brethren, I speak after the manner
of men…when we were children we were in bondage under the elements of the world; but when the fulness of
time was come, God sent forth His Son.’ This is precisely what the argument of Tertullian requires, and they
are the very words which he connects together” (Lardner, Hist. of Heretics, x. 43). Dr. Lardner, touching Marcion’s
omissions in this chap. iii. of the Epistle to the Galatians, says: “He omitted vers. 6, 7, 8, in order to get rid of
the mention of Abraham, and of the gospel having been preached to him.” This he said after St. Jerome, and
then adds: “He ought also to have omitted part of ver. 9, σὺν τῷ πιστῷ ᾽Αβραάμ, which seems to have been the
case, according to T.’s manner of stating the argument against him” (Works, History of Heretics, x. 43).</note>

Son”5329—the God, of course, who is the Lord of that very succession of times which constitutes
an age; who also ordained, as “signs” of time, suns and moons and constellations
and stars; who furthermore both predetermined and predicted that the revelation of His
Son should be postponed to the end of the times.5330 “It shall come to pass in the last days,
that the mountain (of the house) of the Lord shall be manifested”;5331 “and in the last days
I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh”5332 as Joel says. It was characteristic of Him
(only)5333 to wait patiently for the fulness of time, to whom belonged the end of time no
less than the beginning. But as for that idle god, who has neither any work nor any prophecy,
nor accordingly any time, to show for himself, what has he ever done to bring about the
fulness of time, or to wait patiently its completion? If nothing, what an impotent state to
have to wait for the Creator’s time, in servility to the Creator! But for what end did He send
His Son? “To redeem them that were under the law,”5334 in other words, to “make the
crooked ways straight, and the rough places smooth,” as Isaiah says5335—in order that old
things might pass away, and a new course begin, even “the new law out of Zion, and the
word of the Lord from Jerusalem,”5336 and “that we might receive the adoption of sons,”5337
that is, the Gentiles, who once were not sons. For He is to be “the light of the Gentiles,” and
“in His name shall the Gentiles trust.”5338 That we may have, therefore the assurance that
we are the children of God, “He hath sent forth His Spirit into our hearts, crying, Abba,
Father.”5339 For “in the last days,” saith He, “I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh.”5340</p>
<p>Now, from whom comes this grace, but from Him who proclaimed the promise thereof?
Who is (our) Father, but He who is also our Maker? Therefore, after such affluence (of
grace), they should not have returned “to weak and beggarly elements.”5341 By the Romans,
however, the rudiments of learning are wont to be called elements. He did not therefore
seek, by any depreciation of the mundane elements, to turn them away from their god, al-

though, when he said just before, “Howbeit, then, ye serve them which by nature are no
gods,”5342 he censured the error of that physical or natural superstition which holds the
elements to be god; but at the God of those elements he aimed not in this censure.5343 He
tells us himself clearly enough what he means by “elements,” even the rudiments of the law:
“Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years”5344—the sabbaths, I suppose, and “the
preparations,”5345 and the fasts, and the “high days.”5346 For the cessation of even these,
no less than of circumcision, was appointed by the Creator’s decrees, who had said by Isaiah,
“Your new moons, and your sabbaths, and your high days I cannot bear; your fasting, and
feasts, and ceremonies my soul hateth;”5347 also by Amos, “I hate, I despise your feast-days,
and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies;”5348 and again by Hosea, “I will cause to
cease all her mirth, and her feast-days, and her sabbaths, and her new moons, and all her
solemn assemblies.”5349 The institutions which He set up Himself, you ask, did He then
destroy? Yes, rather than any other. Or if another destroyed them, he only helped on the
purpose of the Creator, by removing what even He had condemned. But this is not the place
to discuss the question why the Creator abolished His own laws. It is enough for us to have
proved that He intended such an abolition, that so it may be affirmed that the apostle determined
nothing to the prejudice of the Creator, since the abolition itself proceeds from
the Creator. But as, in the case of thieves, something of the stolen goods is apt to drop by
the way, as a clue to their detection; so, as it seems to me, it has happened to Marcion: the
last mention of Abraham’s name he has left untouched (in the epistle), although no passage
required his erasure more than this, even his partial alteration of the text.5350 “For (it is
written) that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bond maid, the other by a free woman;
but he who was of the bond maid was born after the flesh, but he of the free woman was by
promise: which things are allegorized”5351 (that is to say, they presaged something besides

the literal history); “for these are the two covenants,” or the two exhibitions (of the divine
plans),5352 as we have found the word interpreted, “the one from the Mount Sinai,” in relation
to the synagogue of the Jews, according to the law, “which gendereth to bondage”—“the
other gendereth” (to liberty, being raised) above all principality, and power, and dominion,
and every name that is named, not only in this world, but in that which is to come, “which
is the mother of us all,” in which we have the promise of (Christ’s) holy church; by reason
of which he adds in conclusion: “So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond woman,
but of the free.”5353 In this passage he has undoubtedly shown that Christianity had a noble
birth, being sprung, as the mystery of the allegory indicates, from that son of Abraham who
was born of the free woman; whereas from the son of the bond maid came the legal bondage
of Judaism. Both dispensations, therefore, emanate from that same God by whom,5354 as
we have found, they were both sketched out beforehand. When he speaks of “the liberty
wherewith Christ hath made us free,”5355 does not the very phrase indicate that He is the
Liberator who was once the Master? For Galba himself never liberated slaves which were
not his own, even when about to restore free men to their liberty.5356 By Him, therefore,
will liberty be bestowed, at whose command lay the enslaving power of the law. And very
properly. It was not meet that those who had received liberty should be “entangled again
with the yoke of bondage”5357—that is, of the law; now that the Psalm had its prophecy accomplished:
“Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us, since the
rulers have gathered themselves together against the Lord and against His Christ.”5358 All
those, therefore, who had been delivered from the yoke of slavery he would earnestly have
to obliterate the very mark of slavery—even circumcision, on the authority of the prophet’s
prediction. He remembered how that Jeremiah had said, “Circumcise the foreskins of your
heart;”5359 as Moses likewise had enjoined, “Circumcise your hard hearts”5360—not the
literal flesh. If, now, he were for excluding circumcision, as the messenger of a new god,
why does he say that “in Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircum-

cision?”5361 For it was his duty to prefer the rival principle of that which he was abolishing,
if he had a mission from the god who was the enemy of circumcision.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since both circumcision and uncircumcision were attributed to the same
Deity, both lost their power5362 in Christ, by reason of the excellency of faith—of that faith
concerning which it had been written, “And in His name shall the Gentiles trust?”5363—of
that faith “which,” he says “worketh by love.”5364 By this saying he also shows that the
Creator is the source of that grace. For whether he speaks of the love which is due to God,
or that which is due to one’s neighbor—in either case, the Creator’s grace is meant: for it is
He who enjoins the first in these words, “Thou shalt love God with all thine heart, and with
all thy soul, and with all thy strength;”5365 and also the second in another passage: “Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”5366 “But he that troubleth you shall have to bear judgment.”
5367 From what God? From (Marcion’s) most excellent god? But he does not execute
judgment. From the Creator? But neither will He condemn the maintainer of circumcision.
Now, if none other but the Creator shall be found to execute judgment, it follows that only
He, who has determined on the cessation of the law, shall be able to condemn the defenders
of the law; and what, if he also affirms the law in that portion of it where it ought (to be
permanent)? “For,” says he, “all the law is fulfilled in you by this: ‘Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself.’”5368 If, indeed, he will have it that by the words “it is fulfilled” it is
implied that the law no longer has to be fulfilled, then of course he does not mean that I
should any more love my neighbour as myself, since this precept must have ceased together
with the law. But no! we must evermore continue to observe this commandment. The Creator’s
law, therefore, has received the approval of the rival god, who has, in fact, bestowed
upon it not the sentence of a summary dismissal,5369 but the favour of a compendious ac-

accomplished except a man love his neighbour as himself, it is evident that the precept,
“Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself” (which, in fact, underlies the injunction, “Bear
ye one another’s burdens”), is really “the law of Christ,” though literally the law of the Creator.
Christ, therefore, is the Creator’s Christ, as Christ’s law is the Creator’s law. “Be not
deceived,5372 God is not mocked.”5373 But Marcion’s god can be mocked; for he knows not
how to be angry, or how to take vengeance. “For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he
also reap.”5374 It is then the God of recompense and judgment who threatens5375 this. “Let
us not be weary in well-doing;”5376 and “as we have opportunity, let us do good.”5377 Deny
now that the Creator has given a commandment to do good, and then a diversity of precept
may argue a difference of gods. If, however, He also announces recompense, then from the
same God must come the harvest both of death5378 and of life. But “in due time we shall
reap;”5379 because in Ecclesiastes it is said, “For everything there will be a time.”5380
Moreover, “the world is crucified unto me,” who am a servant of the Creator—“the world,”
(I say,) but not the God who made the world—“and I unto the world,”5381 not unto the God
who made the world. The world, in the apostle’s sense, here means life and conversation
according to worldly principles; it is in renouncing these that we and they are mutually
crucified and mutually slain. He calls them “persecutors of Christ.”5382 But when he adds,
that “he bare in his body the scars5383 of Christ”—since scars, of course, are accidents of
body5384—he therefore expressed the truth, that the flesh of Christ is not putative, but real
and substantial,5385 the scars of which he represents as borne upon his body.</p>

<head>Chapter V.—The First Epistle to the Corinthians. The Pauline Salutation of Grace
and Peace Shown to Be Anti-Marcionite. The Cross of Christ Purposed by the
Creator. Marcion Only Perpetuates the Offence and Foolishness of Christ’s Cross
by His Impious Severance of the Gospel from the Creator. Analogies Between
the Law and the Gospel in the Matter of Weak Things, and Foolish Things and
Base Things.</head>
<p>My preliminary remarks5386 on the preceding epistle called me away from treating of
its superscription,5387 for I was sure that another opportunity would occur for considering
the matter, it being of constant recurrence, and in the same form too, in every epistle. The
point, then, is, that it is not (the usual) health which the apostle prescribes for those to whom
he writes, but “grace and peace.”5388 I do not ask, indeed, what a destroyer of Judaism has
to do with a formula which the Jews still use. For to this day they salute each other5389 with
the greeting of “peace,” and formerly in their Scriptures they did the same. But I understand
him by his practice5390 plainly enough to have corroborated the declaration of the Creator:
“How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good, who preach the gospel
of peace!”5391 For the herald of good, that is, of God’s “grace” was well aware that along with
it “peace” also was to be proclaimed.5392 Now, when he announces these blessings as “from
God the Father and the Lord Jesus,”5393 he uses titles that are common to both, and which
are also adapted to the mystery of our faith;5394 and I suppose it to be impossible accurately
to determine what God is declared to be the Father and the Lord Jesus, unless (we consider)
which of their accruing attributes are more suited to them severally.5395 First, then, I assert
that none other than the Creator and Sustainer of both man and the universe can be acknowledged
as Father and Lord; next, that to the Father also the title of Lord accrues by reason
of His power, and that the Son too receives the same through the Father; then that “grace
and peace” are not only His who had them published, but His likewise to whom offence had
been given. For neither does grace exist, except after offence; nor peace, except after war.

Now, both the people (of Israel) by their transgression of His laws,5396 and the whole race
of mankind by their neglect of natural duty,5397 had both sinned and rebelled against the
Creator. Marcion’s god, however, could not have been offended, both because he was unknown
to everybody, and because he is incapable of being irritated. What grace, therefore,
can be had of a god who has not been offended? What peace from one who has never experienced
rebellion? “The cross of Christ,” he says, “is to them that perish foolishness; but unto
such as shall obtain salvation, it is the power of God and the wisdom of God.”5398 And then,
that we may know from whence this comes, he adds: “For it is written, ‘I will destroy the
wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.’”5399 Now,
since these are the Creator’s words, and since what pertains to the doctrine5400 of the cross
he accounts as foolishness, therefore both the cross, and also Christ by reason of the cross,
will appertain to the Creator, by whom were predicted the incidents of the cross. But if5401
the Creator, as an enemy, took away their wisdom in order that the cross of Christ, considered
as his adversary, should be accounted foolishness, how by any possibility can the Creator
have foretold anything about the cross of a Christ who is not His own, and of whom He
knew nothing, when He published the prediction? But, again, how happens it, that in the
system of a Lord5402 who is so very good, and so profuse in mercy, some carry off salvation,
when they believe the cross to be the wisdom and power of God, whilst others incur perdition,
to whom the cross of Christ is accounted folly;—(how happens it, I repeat,) unless it is in
the Creator’s dispensation to have punished both the people of Israel and the human race,
for some great offence committed against Him, with the loss of wisdom and prudence?
What follows will confirm this suggestion, when he asks, “Hath not God infatuated the
wisdom of this world?”5403 and when he adds the reason why: “For after that, in the wisdom
of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God5404 by the foolishness of
preaching to save them that believe.”5405 But first a word about the expression “the world;”

showing that by world is meant the lord of the world. We, however, understand the term to
apply to any person that is in the world, by a simple idiom of human language, which often
substitutes that which contains for that which is contained. “The circus shouted,” “The
forum spoke,” and “The basilica murmured,” are well-known expressions, meaning that
the people in these places did so. Since then the man, not the god, of the world5407 in his
wisdom knew not God, whom indeed he ought to have known (both the Jew by his knowledge
of the Scriptures, and all the human race by their knowledge of God’s works), therefore that
God, who was not acknowledged in His wisdom, resolved to smite men’s knowledge with
His foolishness, by saving all those who believe in the folly of the preached cross. “Because
the Jews require signs,” who ought to have already made up their minds about God, “and
the Greeks seek after wisdom,”5408 who rely upon their own wisdom, and not upon God’s.
If, however, it was a new god that was being preached, what sin had the Jews committed, in
seeking after signs to believe; or the Greeks, when they hunted after a wisdom which they
would prefer to accept? Thus the very retribution which overtook both Jews and Greeks
proves that God is both a jealous God and a Judge, inasmuch as He infatuated the world’s
wisdom by an angry5409 and a judicial retribution. Since, then, the causes5410 are in the
hands of Him who gave us the Scriptures which we use, it follows that the apostle, when
treating of the Creator, (as Him whom both Jew and Gentile as yet have) not known, means
undoubtedly to teach us, that the God who is to become known (in Christ) is the Creator.
The very “stumbling-block” which he declares Christ to be “to the Jews,”5411 points unmistakeably5412
to the Creator’s prophecy respecting Him, when by Isaiah He says: “Behold I
lay in Sion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence.”5413 This rock or stone is Christ.5414
This stumbling-stone Marcion retains still.5415 Now, what is that “foolishness of God which
is wiser than men,” but the cross and death of Christ? What is that “weakness of God which

is stronger than men,”5416 but the nativity and incarnation5417 of God? If, however, Christ
was not born of the Virgin, was not constituted of human flesh, and thereby really suffered
neither death nor the cross, there was nothing in Him either of foolishness or weakness;
nor is it any longer true, that “God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound
the wise;” nor, again, hath “God chosen the weak things of the world to confound the
mighty;” nor “the base things” and the least things “in the world, and things which are despised,
which are even as nothing” (that is, things which really5418 are not), “to bring to
nothing things which are” (that is, which really are).5419 For nothing in the dispensation of
God is found to be mean, and ignoble, and contemptible. Such only occurs in man’s arrangement.
The very Old Testament of the Creator5420 itself, it is possible, no doubt, to charge
with foolishness, and weakness, and dishonour and meanness, and contempt. What is more
foolish and more weak than God’s requirement of bloody sacrifices and of savoury holocausts?
What is weaker than the cleansing of vessels and of beds?5421 What more dishonourable
than the discoloration of the reddening skin?5422 What so mean as the statute of
retaliation? What so contemptible as the exception in meats and drinks? The whole of the
Old Testament, the heretic, to the best of my belief, holds in derision. For God has chosen
the foolish things of the world to confound its wisdom. Marcion’s god has no such discipline,
because he does not take after5423 (the Creator) in the process of confusing opposites by
their opposites, so that “no flesh shall glory; but, as it is written, He that glorieth, let him
glory in the Lord.”5424 In what Lord? Surely in Him who gave this precept.5425 Unless,
forsooth, the Creator enjoined us to glory in the god of Marcion.</p>

<p>By all these statements, therefore, does he show us what God he means, when he says,
“We speak the wisdom of God among them that are perfect.”5426 It is that God who has
confounded the wisdom of the wise, who has brought to nought the understanding of the
prudent, who has reduced to folly5427 the world’s wisdom, by choosing its foolish things,
and disposing them to the attainment of salvation. This wisdom, he says, once lay hidden
in things that were foolish, weak, and lacking in honour; once also was latent under figures,
allegories, and enigmatical types; but it was afterwards to be revealed in Christ, who was set
“as a light to the Gentiles,”5428 by the Creator who promised through the mouth of Isaiah
that He would discover “the hidden treasures, which eye had not seen.”5429 Now, that that
god should have ever hidden anything who had never made a cover wherein to practise
concealment, is in itself a wholly incredible idea. If he existed, concealment of himself was
out of the question—to say nothing5430 of any of his religious ordinances.5431 The Creator,
on the contrary, was as well known in Himself as His ordinances were. These, we know,
were publicly instituted5432 in Israel; but they lay overshadowed with latent meanings, in
which the wisdom of God was concealed,5433 to be brought to light by and by amongst “the
perfect,” when the time should come, but “pre-ordained in the counsels of God before the
ages.”5434 But whose ages, if not the Creator’s? For because ages consist of times, and times
are made up of days, and months, and years; since also days, and months, and years are
measured by suns, and moons, and stars, which He ordained for this purpose (for “they
shall be,” says He, “for signs of the months and the years”),5435 it clearly follows that the

ages belong to the Creator, and that nothing of what was fore-ordained before the ages can
be said to be the property of any other being than Him who claims the ages also as His own.
Else let Marcion show that the ages belong to his god. He must then also claim the world
itself for him; for it is in it that the ages are reckoned, the vessel as it were5436 of the times,
as well as the signs thereof, or their order. But he has no such demonstration to show us. I
go back therefore to the point, and ask him this question: Why did (his god) fore-ordain
our glory before the ages of the Creator? I could understand his having predetermined it
before the ages, if he had revealed it at the commencement of time.5437 But when he does
this almost at the very expiration of all the ages5438 of the Creator, his predestination before
the ages, and not rather within the ages, was in vain, because he did not mean to make any
revelation of his purpose until the ages had almost run out their course. For it is wholly inconsistent
in him to be so forward in planning purposes, who is so backward in revealing
them.</p>
<p>In the Creator, however, the two courses were perfectly compatible—both the predestination
before the ages and the revelation at the end thereof, because that which He both
fore-ordained and revealed He also in the intermediate space of time announced by the preministration
of figures, and symbols, and allegories. But because (the apostle) subjoins, on
the subject of our glory, that “none of the princes of this world knew it, for had they known
it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory,”5439 the heretic argues that the princes
of this world crucified the Lord (that is, the Christ of the rival god) in order that this blow
might even recoil5440 on the Creator Himself. Any one, however, who has seen from what
we have already said how our glory must be regarded as issuing from the Creator, will already
have come to the conclusion that, inasmuch as the Creator settled it in His own secret purpose,
it properly enough was unknown to all the princes5441 and powers of the Creator, on
the principle that servants are not permitted to know their masters’ plans, much less the
fallen angels and the leader of transgression himself, the devil; for I should contend that
these, on account of their fall, were greater strangers still to any knowledge of the Creator’s
dispensations. But it is no longer open to me5442 even to interpret the princes and powers
of this world as the Creator’s, since the apostle imputes ignorance to them, whereas even
the devil according to our Gospel recognised Jesus in the temptation,5443 and, according to

the record which is common to both (Marcionites and ourselves) the evil spirit knew that
Jesus was the Holy One of God, and that Jesus was His name, and that He was come to
destroy them.5444 The parable also of the strong man armed, whom a stronger than he
overcame and seized his goods, is admitted by Marcion to have reference to the Creator:5445
therefore the Creator could not have been ignorant any longer of the God of glory, since
He is overcome by him;5446 nor could He have crucified him whom He was unable to cope
with. The inevitable inference, therefore, as it seems to me, is that we must believe that the
princes and powers of the Creator did knowingly crucify the God of glory in His Christ,
with that desperation and excessive malice with which the most abandoned slaves do not
even hesitate to slay their masters. For it is written in my Gospel5447 that “Satan entered
into Judas.”5448 According to Marcion, however, the apostle in the passage under consideration5449
does not allow the imputation of ignorance, with respect to the Lord of glory, to
the powers of the Creator; because, indeed, he will have it that these are not meant by “the
princes of this world.” But (the apostle) evidently5450 did not speak of spiritual princes; so
that he meant secular ones, those of the princely people, (chief in the divine dispensation,
although) not, of course, amongst the nations of the world, and their rulers, and king Herod,
and even Pilate, and, as represented by him,5451 that power of Rome which was the greatest
in the world, and then presided over by him. Thus the arguments of the other side are pulled
down, and our own proofs are thereby built up. But you still maintain that our glory comes
from your god, with whom it also lay in secret. Then why does your god employ the selfsame
Scripture5452 which the apostle also relies on? What has your god to do at all with the
sayings of the prophets? “Who hath discovered the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His
counsellor?”5453 So says Isaiah. What has he also to do with illustrations from our God? For
when (the apostle) calls himself “a wise master-builder,”5454 we find that the Creator by
Isaiah designates the teacher who sketches5455 out the divine discipline by the same title, “I

will take away from Judah the cunning artificer,”5456 etc. And was it not Paul himself who
was there foretold, destined “to be taken away from Judah”—that is, from Judaism—for the
erection of Christianity, in order “to lay that only foundation, which is Christ?”5457 Of this
work the Creator also by the same prophet says, “Behold, I lay in Sion for a foundation a
precious stone and honourable; and he that resteth thereon shall not be confounded.”5458
Unless it be, that God professed Himself to be the builder up of an earthly work, that so He
might not give any sign of His Christ, as destined to be the foundation of such as believe in
Him, upon which every man should build at will the superstructure of either sound or
worthless doctrine; forasmuch as it is the Creator’s function, when a man’s work shall be
tried by fire, (or) when a reward shall be recompensed to him by fire; because it is by fire
that the test is applied to the building which you erect upon the foundation which is laid by
Him, that is, the foundation of His Christ.5459 “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God,
and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?”5460 Now, since man is the property, and the
work, and the image and likeness of the Creator, having his flesh, formed by Him of the
ground, and his soul of His afflatus, it follows that Marcion’s god wholly dwells in a temple
which belongs to another, if so be we are not the Creator’s temple. But “if any man defile
the temple of God, he shall be himself destroyed”5461—of course, by the God of the
temple.5462 If you threaten an avenger, you threaten us with the Creator. “Ye must become
fools, that ye may be wise.”5463 Wherefore? “Because the wisdom of this world is foolishness
with God.”5464 With what God? Even if the ancient Scriptures have contributed nothing in
support of our view thus far,5465 an excellent testimony turns up in what (the apostle) here

<head>Chapter VII.—St. Paul’s Phraseology Often Suggested by the Jewish Scriptures.
Christ Our Passover—A Phrase Which Introduces Us to the Very Heart of the
Ancient Dispensation. Christ’s True Corporeity. Married and Unmarried States.
Meaning of the Time is Short. In His Exhortations and Doctrine, the Apostle
Wholly Teaches According to the Mind and Purposes of the God of the Old
Testament. Prohibition of Meats and Drinks Withdrawn by the Creator.</head>
<p>“And the hidden things of darkness He will Himself bring to light,”5472 even by Christ;
for He has promised Christ to be a Light,5473 and Himself He has declared to be a lamp,
“searching the hearts and reins.”5474 From Him also shall “praise be had by every man,”5475
from whom proceeds, as from a judge, the opposite also of praise. But here, at least, you say
he interprets the world to be the God thereof, when he says: “We are made a spectacle unto
the world, and to angels, and to men.”5476 For if by world he had meant the people thereof,
he would not have afterwards specially mentioned “men.” To prevent, however, your using
such an argument as this, the Holy Ghost has providentially explained the meaning of the
passage thus: “We are made a spectacle to the world,” i.e. “both to angels,” who minister
therein, “and to men,” who are the objects of their ministration.5477 Of course,5478 a man
of the noble courage of our apostle (to say nothing of the Holy Ghost) was afraid, when
writing to the children whom he had begotten in the gospel, to speak freely of the God of
the world; for against Him he could not possibly seem to have a word to say, except only in
a straightforward manner!5479 I quite admit, that, according to the Creator’s law,5480 the
man was an offender “who had his father’s wife.”5481 He followed, no doubt,5482 the principles
of natural and public law. When, however, he condemns the man “to be delivered
unto Satan,”5483 he becomes the herald of an avenging God. It does not matter5484 that he

also said, “For the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the
Lord,”5485 since both in the destruction of the flesh and in the saving of the spirit there is,
on His part, judicial process; and when he bade “the wicked person be put away from the
midst of them,”5486 he only mentioned what is a very frequently recurring sentence of the
Creator. “Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened.”5487
The unleavened bread was therefore, in the Creator’s ordinance, a figure of us (Christians).
“For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.”5488 But why is Christ our passover, if the
passover be not a type of Christ, in the similitude of the blood which saves, and of the Lamb,
which is Christ?5489 Why does (the apostle) clothe us and Christ with symbols of the Creator’s
solemn rites, unless they had relation to ourselves? When, again, he warns us against fornication,
he reveals the resurrection of the flesh. “The body,” says he, “is not for fornication,
but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body,”5490 just as the temple is for God, and God for
the temple. A temple will therefore pass away5491 with its god, and its god with the temple.
You see, then, how that “He who raised up the Lord will also raise us up.”5492 In the body
will He raise us, because the body is for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. And suitably
does he add the question: “Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?”5493
What has the heretic to say? That these members of Christ will not rise again, for they are
no longer our own? “For,” he says, “ye are bought with a price.”5494 A price! surely none
at all was paid, since Christ was a phantom, nor had He any corporeal substance which He
could pay for our bodies! But, in truth, Christ had wherewithal to redeem us; and since He
has redeemed, at a great price, these bodies of ours, against which fornication must not be
committed (because they are now members of Christ, and not our own), surely He will secure,
on His own account, the safety of those whom He made His own at so much cost! Now,
how shall we glorify, how shall we exalt, God in our body,5495 which is doomed to perish?
We must now encounter the subject of marriage, which Marcion, more continent5496 than

the apostle, prohibits. For the apostle, although preferring the grace of continence,5497 yet
permits the contraction of marriage and the enjoyment of it,5498 and advises the continuance
therein rather than the dissolution thereof.5499 Christ plainly forbids divorce, Moses unquestionably
permits it.5500</p>
<p>Now, when Marcion wholly prohibits all carnal intercourse to the faithful (for we will
say nothing5501 about his catechumens), and when he prescribes repudiation of all engagements
before marriage, whose teaching does he follow, that of Moses or of Christ? Even
Christ,5502 however, when He here commands “the wife not to depart from her husband,
or if she depart, to remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband,”5503 both permitted
divorce, which indeed He never absolutely prohibited, and confirmed (the sanctity) of
marriage, by first forbidding its dissolution; and, if separation had taken place, by wishing
the nuptial bond to be resumed by reconciliation. But what reasons does (the apostle) allege
for continence? Because “the time is short.”5504 I had almost thought it was because in
Christ there was another god! And yet He from whom emanates this shortness of the time,
will also send what suits the said brevity. No one makes provision for the time which is another’s.
You degrade your god, O Marcion, when you make him circumscribed at all by the
Creator’s time. Assuredly also, when (the apostle) rules that marriage should be “only in
the Lord,”5505 that no Christian should intermarry with a heathen, he maintains a law of
the Creator, who everywhere prohibits marriage with strangers. But when he says, “although
there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth,”5506 the meaning of his words
is clear—not as if there were gods in reality, but as if there were some who are called gods,
without being truly so. He introduces his discussion about meats offered to idols with a
statement concerning idols (themselves): “We know that an idol is nothing in the world.”5507

Marcion, however, does not say that the Creator is not God; so that the apostle can hardly
be thought to have ranked the Creator amongst those who are called gods, without being
so; since, even if they had been gods, “to us there is but one God, the Father.”5508 Now, from
whom do all things come to us, but from Him to whom all things belong? And pray, what
things are these? You have them in a preceding part of the epistle: “All things are yours;
whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or
things to come.”5509 He makes the Creator, then the God of all things, from whom proceed
both the world and life and death, which cannot possibly belong to the other god. From
Him, therefore, amongst the “all things” comes also Christ.5510 When he teaches that every
man ought to live of his own industry,5511 he begins with a copious induction of examples—of
soldiers, and shepherds, and husbandmen.5512 But he5513 wanted divine authority. What
was the use, however, of adducing the Creator’s, which he was destroying? It was vain to do
so; for his god had no such authority! (The apostle) says: “Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
treadeth out the corn,”5514 and adds: “Doth God take care of oxen?” Yes, of oxen, for the
sake of men! For, says he, “it is written for our sakes.”5515 Thus he showed that the law had
a symbolic reference to ourselves, and that it gives its sanction in favour of those who live
of the gospel. (He showed) also, that those who preach the gospel are on this account sent
by no other god but Him to whom belongs the law, which made provision for them, when
he says: “For our sakes was this written.”5516 Still he declined to use this power which the
law gave him, because he preferred working without any restraint.5517 Of this he boasted,
and suffered no man to rob him of such glory5518—certainly with no view of destroying the
law, which he proved that another man might use. For behold Marcion, in his blindness,
stumbled at the rock whereof our fathers drank in the wilderness. For since “that rock was
Christ,”5519 it was, of course, the Creator’s, to whom also belonged the people. But why resort
to the figure of a sacred sign given by an extraneous god?5520 Was it to teach the very truth,

that ancient things prefigured the Christ who was to be educed5521 out of them? For, being
about to take a cursory view of what befell the people (of Israel) he begins with saying: “Now
these things happened as examples for us.”5522 Now, tell me, were these examples given by
the Creator to men belonging to a rival god? Or did one god borrow examples from another,
and a hostile one too? He withdraws me to himself in alarm5523 from Him from whom he
transfers my allegiance. Will his antagonist make me better disposed to him? Should I now
commit the same sins as the people, shall I have to suffer the same penalties, or not?5524 But
if not the same, how vainly does he propose to me terrors which I shall not have to endure!
From whom, again, shall I have to endure them? If from the Creator, What evils does it
appertain to Him to inflict? And how will it happen that, jealous God as He is, He shall
punish the man who offends His rival, instead of rather encouraging5525 him. If, however,
from the other god—but he knows not how to punish. So that the whole declaration of the
apostle lacks a reasonable basis, if it is not meant to relate to the Creator’s discipline. But
the fact is, the apostle’s conclusion corresponds to the beginning: “Now all these things
happened unto them for ensamples; and they are written for our admonition, upon whom
the ends of the world are come.”5526 What a Creator! how prescient already, and considerate
in warning Christians who belong to another god! Whenever cavils occur the like to those
which have been already dealt with, I pass them by; certain others I despatch briefly. A great
argument for another god is the permission to eat of all kinds of meats, contrary to the
law.5527 Just as if we did not ourselves allow that the burdensome ordinances of the law
were abrogated—but by Him who imposed them, who also promised the new condition of
things.5528 The same, therefore, who prohibited meats, also restored the use of them, just
as He had indeed allowed them from the beginning. If, however, some strange god had come
to destroy our God, his foremost prohibition would certainly have been, that his own votaries
should abstain from supporting their lives on the resources of his adversary.</p>

Spiritual Gifts. The Sevenfold Spirit Described by Isaiah. The Apostle and the
Prophet Compared. Marcion Challenged to Produce Anything Like These Gifts
of the Spirit Foretold in Prophecy in His God.</head>
<p>“The head of every man is Christ.”5529 What Christ, if He is not the author of man? The
head he has here put for authority; now “authority” will accrue to none else than the “author.”
Of what man indeed is He the head? Surely of him concerning whom he adds soon afterwards:
“The man ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image of God.”5530 Since then
he is the image of the Creator (for He, when looking on Christ His Word, who was to become
man, said, “Let us make man in our own image, after our likeness”5531), how can I possibly
have another head but Him whose image I am? For if I am the image of the Creator there
is no room in me for another head. But wherefore “ought the woman to have power over
her head, because of the angels?”5532 If it is because “she was created for the man,”5533 and
taken out of the man, according to the Creator’s purpose, then in this way too has the apostle
maintained the discipline of that God from whose institution he explains the reasons of His
discipline. He adds: “Because of the angels.”5534 What angels? In other words, whose angels?
If he means the fallen angels of the Creator,5535 there is great propriety in his meaning. It
is right that that face which was a snare to them should wear some mark of a humble guise
and obscured beauty. If, however, the angels of the rival god are referred to, what fear is
there for them? for not even Marcion’s disciples, (to say nothing of his angels,) have any
desire for women. We have often shown before now, that the apostle classes heresies as
evil5536 among “works of the flesh,” and that he would have those persons accounted estimable5537
who shun heresies as an evil thing. In like manner, when treating of the gospel,5538
we have proved from the sacrament of the bread and the cup5539 the verity of the Lord’s
body and blood in opposition to Marcion’s phantom; whilst throughout almost the whole

of my work it has been contended that all mention of judicial attributes points conclusively
to the Creator as to a God who judges. Now, on the subject of “spiritual gifts,”5540 I have to
remark that these also were promised by the Creator through Christ; and I think that we
may derive from this a very just conclusion that the bestowal of a gift is not the work of a
god other than Him who is proved to have given the promise. Here is a prophecy of Isaiah:
“There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a flower5541 shall spring up from
his root; and upon Him shall rest the Spirit of the Lord.” After which he enumerates the
special gifts of the same: “The spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and
might, the spirit of knowledge and of religion.5542 And with the fear of the Lord5543 shall
the Spirit fill Him.”5544 In this figure of a flower he shows that Christ was to arise out of the
rod which sprang from the stem of Jesse; in other words, from the virgin of the race of
David, the son of Jesse. In this Christ the whole substantia of the Spirit would have to rest,
not meaning that it would be as it were some subsequent acquisition accruing to Him who
was always, even before His incarnation, the Spirit of God;5545 so that you cannot argue
from this that the prophecy has reference to that Christ who (as mere man of the race only
of David) was to obtain the Spirit of his God. (The prophet says,) on the contrary, that from
the time when (the true Christ) should appear in the flesh as the flower predicted,5546 rising
from the root of Jesse, there would have to rest upon Him the entire operation of the Spirit
of grace, which, so far as the Jews were concerned, would cease and come to an end. This
result the case itself shows; for after this time the Spirit of the Creator never breathed amongst
them. From Judah were taken away “the wise man, and the cunning artificer, and the
counsellor, and the prophet;”5547 that so it might prove true that “the law and the prophets
were until John.”5548 Now hear how he declared that by Christ Himself, when returned to
heaven, these spiritual gifts were to be sent: “He ascended up on high,” that is, into heaven;
“He led captivity captive,” meaning death or slavery of man; “He gave gifts to the sons of
men,”5549 that is, the gratuities, which we call charismata. He says specifically “sons of

men,”5550 and not men promiscuously; thus exhibiting to us those who were the children
of men truly so called, choice men, apostles. “For,” says he, “I have begotten you through
the gospel;”5551 and “Ye are my children, of whom I travail again in birth.”5552 Now was
absolutely fulfilled that promise of the Spirit which was given by the word of Joel: “In the
last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and their sons and their daughters shall
prophesy; and upon my servants and upon my handmaids will I pour out of my Spirit.”5553
Since, then, the Creator promised the gift of His Spirit in the latter days; and since Christ
has in these last days appeared as the dispenser of spiritual gifts (as the apostle says, “When
the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son;”5554 and again, “This I say,
brethren, that the time is short”5555), it evidently follows in connection with this prediction
of the last days, that this gift of the Spirit belongs to Him who is the Christ of the predicters.
Now compare the Spirit’s specific graces, as they are described by the apostle, and promised
by the prophet Isaiah. “To one is given,” says he, “by the Spirit the word of wisdom;” this
we see at once is what Isaiah declared to be “the spirit of wisdom.” “To another, the word
of knowledge;” this will be “the (prophet’s) spirit of understanding and counsel.” “To another,
faith by the same Spirit;” this will be “the spirit of religion and the fear of the Lord.” “To
another, the gifts of healing, and to another the working of miracles;” this will be “the spirit
of might.” “To another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another divers kinds
of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues;” this will be “the spirit of knowledge.”5556
See how the apostle agrees with the prophet both in making the distribution of the one
Spirit, and in interpreting His special graces. This, too, I may confidently say: he who has
likened the unity of our body throughout its manifold and divers members to the compacting
together of the various gifts of the Spirit,5557 shows also that there is but one Lord of the
human body and of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit, (according to the apostle’s showing,)5558
meant not5559 that the service5560 of these gifts should be in the body,5561 nor did He place

them in the human body); and on the subject of the superiority of love5562 above all these
gifts, He even taught the apostle that it was the chief commandment,5563 just as Christ has
shown it to be: “Thou shalt love the Lord with all thine heart and soul,5564 with all thy
strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thine own self.”5565 When he mentions
the fact that “it is written in the law,”5566 how that the Creator would speak with other
tongues and other lips, whilst confirming indeed the gift of tongues by such a mention, he
yet cannot be thought to have affirmed that the gift was that of another god by his reference
to the Creator’s prediction.5567 In precisely the same manner,5568 when enjoining on women
silence in the church, that they speak not for the mere sake5569 of learning5570 (although
that even they have the right of prophesying, he has already shown5571 when he covers the
woman that prophesies with a veil), he goes to the law for his sanction that woman should
be under obedience.5572 Now this law, let me say once for all, he ought to have made no
other acquaintance with, than to destroy it. But that we may now leave the subject of spiritual
gifts, facts themselves will be enough to prove which of us acts rashly in claiming them

manifest5574 the secrets of the heart;5575 let him produce a psalm, a vision, a prayer5576—only

Point Similar. Jesus—Not Hezekiah or Solomon—The Subject of These Prophecies

<p>Meanwhile the Marcionite will exhibit nothing of this kind; he is by this time afraid to
say which side has the better right to a Christ who is not yet revealed. Just as my Christ is
to be expected,5581 who was predicted from the beginning, so his Christ therefore has no
existence, as not having been announced from the beginning. Ours is a better faith, which
believes in a future Christ, than the heretic’s, which has none at all to believe in. Touching
the resurrection of the dead,5582 let us first inquire how some persons then denied it. No
doubt in the same way in which it is even now denied, since the resurrection of the flesh
has at all times men to deny it. But many wise men claim for the soul a divine nature, and
are confident of its undying destiny, and even the multitude worship the dead5583 in the
presumption which they boldly entertain that their souls survive. As for our bodies, however,
it is manifest that they perish either at once by fire or the wild beasts,5584 or even when most
carefully kept by length of time. When, therefore, the apostle refutes those who deny the
resurrection of the flesh, he indeed defends, in opposition to them, the precise matter of
their denial, that is, the resurrection of the body. You have the whole answer wrapped up
in this.5585 All the rest is superfluous. Now in this very point, which is called the resurrection
of the dead, it is requisite that the proper force of the words should be accurately maintained.
5586 The word dead expresses simply what has lost the vital principle,5587 by means
of which it used to live. Now the body is that which loses life, and as the result of losing it
becomes dead. To the body, therefore, the term dead is only suitable. Moreover, as resurrection
accrues to what is dead, and dead is a term applicable only to a body, therefore the body
alone has a resurrection incidental to it. So again the word Resurrection, or (rising again),
embraces only that which has fallen down. “To rise,” indeed, can be predicated of that which
has never fallen down, but had already been always lying down. But “to rise again” is predic-

able only of that which has fallen down; because it is by rising again, in consequence of its
having fallen down, that it is said to have re-risen.5588 For the syllable RE always implies
iteration (or happening again). We say, therefore, that the body falls to the ground by death,
as indeed facts themselves show, in accordance with the law of God. For to the body it was
said, (“Till thou return to the ground, for out of it wast thou taken; for) dust thou art, and
unto dust shalt thou return.”5589 That, therefore, which came from the ground shall return
to the ground. Now that falls down which returns to the ground; and that rises again which
falls down. “Since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection.”5590 Here in the
word man, who consists of bodily substance, as we have often shown already, is presented
to me the body of Christ. But if we are all so made alive in Christ, as we die in Adam, it
follows of necessity that we are made alive in Christ as a bodily substance, since we died in
Adam as a bodily substance. The similarity, indeed, is not complete, unless our revival5591
in Christ concur in identity of substance with our mortality5592 in Adam. But at this point5593
(the apostle) has made a parenthetical statement5594 concerning Christ, which, bearing as
it does on our present discussion, must not pass unnoticed. For the resurrection of the body
will receive all the better proof, in proportion as I shall succeed in showing that Christ belongs
to that God who is believed to have provided this resurrection of the flesh in His dispensation.
When he says, “For He must reign, till He hath put all enemies under His feet,”5595 we can
see at once5596 from this statement that he speaks of a God of vengeance, and therefore of
Him who made the following promise to Christ: “Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make
Thine enemies Thy footstool. The rod of Thy strength shall the Lord send forth from Sion,
and He shall rule along with Thee in the midst of Thine enemies.”5597 It is necessary for me
to lay claim to those Scriptures which the Jews endeavour to deprive us of, and to show that
they sustain my view. Now they say that this Psalm5598 was a chant in honour of Hezeki-

did I beget thee from the womb,”5601 are applicable to Hezekiah, and to the birth of
Hezekiah. We on our side5602 have published Gospels (to the credibility of which we have
to thank5603 them5604 for having given some confirmation, indeed, already in so great a
subject5605); and these declare that the Lord was born at night, that so it might be “before
the morning star,” as is evident both from the star especially, and from the testimony of the
angel, who at night announced to the shepherds that Christ had at that moment been
born,5606 and again from the place of the birth, for it is towards night that persons arrive
at the (eastern) “inn.” Perhaps, too, there was a mystic purpose in Christ’s being born at

πρὸ ἑωσφόρου ἐγέννησά σε; and so the Vulgate version has it. This Psalm has been variously applied by the
Jews. Raschi (or Rabbi Sol. Jarchi) thinks it is most suitable to Abraham, and possibly to David, in which latter
view D. Kimchi agrees with him. Others find in Solomon the best application; but more frequently is Hezekiah
thought to be the subject of the Psalm, as Tertullian observes. Justin Martyr (in Dial. cum Tryph.) also notices
this application of the Psalm. But Tertullian in the next sentence appears to recognize the sounder opinion of
the older Jews, who saw in this Ps. cx. a prediction of Messiah. This opinion occurs in the Jerusalem Talmud,
in the tract Berachoth, 5. Amongst the more recent Jews who also hold the sounder view, may be mentioned
Rabbi Saadias Gaon, on Dan. vii. 13, and R. Moses Hadarsan [singularly enough quoted by Raschi in another
part of his commentary (Gen. xxxv. 8)], with others who are mentioned by Wetstein, On the New Testament,
Matt. xxii. 44. Modern Jews, such as Moses Mendelsohn, reject the Messianic sense; and they are followed by
the commentators of the Rationalist school amongst ourselves and in Germany. J. Olshausen, after Hitzig, comes
down in his interpretation of the Psalm as late as the Maccabees, and sees a suitable accomplishment of its words
in the honours heaped upon Jonathan by Alexander son of Antiochus Epiphanes (see 1 Macc. x. 20). For the
refutation of so inadequate a commentary, the reader is referred to Delitzch on Ps. cx. The variations of opinion,
however, in this school, are as remarkable as the fluctuations of the Jewish writers. The latest work on the Psalms
which has appeared amongst us (Psalms, chronologically arranged, by four Friends), after Ewald, places the accomplishment
of Ps. cx. in what may be allowed to have been its occasion—David’s victories over the neighboring
heathen.</note>

night, destined, as He was, to be the light of the truth amidst the dark shadows of ignorance.
Nor, again, would God have said, “I have begotten Thee,” except to His true Son. For although
He says of all the people (Israel), “I have begotten5607 children,”5608 yet He added
not “from the womb.” Now, why should He have added so superfluously this phrase “from
the womb” (as if there could be any doubt about any one’s having been born from the
womb), unless the Holy Ghost had wished the words to be with especial care5609 understood
of Christ? “I have begotten Thee from the womb,” that is to say, from a womb only, without
a man’s seed, making it a condition of a fleshly body5610 that it should come out of a womb.
What is here added (in the Psalm), “Thou art a priest for ever,”5611 relates to (Christ)
Himself. Hezekiah was no priest; and even if he had been one, he would not have been a
priest for ever. “After the order,” says He, “of Melchizedek.” Now what had Hezekiah to do
with Melchizedek, the priest of the most high God, and him uncircumcised too, who blessed
the circumcised Abraham, after receiving from him the offering of tithes? To Christ, however,
“the order of Melchizedek” will be very suitable; for Christ is the proper and legitimate High
Priest of God. He is the Pontiff of the priesthood of the uncircumcision, constituted such,
even then, for the Gentiles, by whom He was to be more fully received, although at His last
coming He will favour with His acceptance and blessing the circumcision also, even the race
of Abraham, which by and by is to acknowledge Him. Well, then, there is also another Psalm,
which begins with these words: “Give Thy judgments, O God, to the King,” that is, to Christ
who was to come as King, “and Thy righteousness unto the King’s son,”5612 that is, to
Christ’s people; for His sons are they who are born again in Him. But it will here be said
that this Psalm has reference to Solomon. However, will not those portions of the Psalm
which apply to Christ alone, be enough to teach us that all the rest, too, relates to Christ,
and not to Solomon? “He shall come down,” says He, “like rain upon a fleece,5613 and like
dropping showers upon the earth,”5614 describing His descent from heaven to the flesh as
gentle and unobserved.5615 Solomon, however, if he had indeed any descent at all, came

not down like a shower, because he descended not from heaven. But I will set before you
more literal points.5616 “He shall have dominion,” says the Psalmist, “from sea to sea, and
from the river unto the ends of the earth.”5617 To Christ alone was this given; whilst Solomon
reigned over only the moderately-sized kingdom of Judah. “Yea, all kings shall fall down
before Him.” Whom, indeed, shall they all thus worship, except Christ? “All nations shall
serve Him.”5618 To whom shall all thus do homage, but Christ? “His name shall endure for
ever.” Whose name has this eternity of fame, but Christ’s? “Longer than the sun shall His
name remain,” for longer than the sun shall be the Word of God, even Christ. “And in Him
shall all nations be blessed.”5619 In Solomon was no nation blessed; in Christ every nation.
And what if the Psalm proves Him to be even God? “They shall call Him blessed.”5620 (On
what ground?) Because blessed is the Lord God of Israel, who only doeth wonderful
things.”5621 “Blessed also is His glorious name, and with His glory shall all the earth be
filled.”5622 On the contrary, Solomon (as I make bold to affirm) lost even the glory which
he had from God, seduced by his love of women even into idolatry. And thus, the statement
which occurs in about the middle of this Psalm, “His enemies shall lick the dust”5623 (of
course, as having been, (to use the apostle’s phrase,) “put under His feet”5624), will bear
upon the very object which I had in view, when I both introduced the Psalm, and insisted
on my opinion of its sense,—namely, that I might demonstrate both the glory of His kingdom
and the subjection of His enemies in pursuance of the Creator’s own plans, with the view
of laying down5625 this conclusion, that none but He can be believed to be the Christ of the
Creator.</p>

<p>Let us now return to the resurrection, to the defence of which against heretics of all
sorts we have given indeed sufficient attention in another work of ours.5626 But we will not
be wanting (in some defence of the doctrine) even here, in consideration of such persons
as are ignorant of that little treatise. “What,” asks he, “shall they do who are baptized for
the dead, if the dead rise not?”5627 Now, never mind5628 that practice, (whatever it may
have been.) The Februarian lustrations5629 will perhaps5630 answer him (quite as well), by
praying for the dead.5631 Do not then suppose that the apostle here indicates some new god
as the author and advocate of this (baptism for the dead. His only aim in alluding to it was)
that he might all the more firmly insist upon the resurrection of the body, in proportion as
they who were vainly baptized for the dead resorted to the practice from their belief of such
a resurrection. We have the apostle in another passage defining “but one baptism.”5632 To
be “baptized for the dead” therefore means, in fact, to be baptized for the body;5633 for, as
<note type="footnote">5626 He refers to his De Resurrect. Carnis. See chap. xlviii.</note>
<note type="footnote">5627 1 Cor. xv. 29.</note>
<note type="footnote">5628 Viderit.</note>
<note type="footnote">5629 Kalendæ Februariæ. The great expiation or lustration, celebrated at Rome in the month which received
its name from the festival, is described by Ovid, Fasti, book ii., lines 19–28, and 267–452, in which latter passage
the same feast is called Lupercalia. Of course as the rites were held on the 15th of the month, the word kalendæ
here has not its more usual meaning (Paley’s edition of the Fasti, pp. 52–76). Oehler refers also to Macrobius,
Saturn. i. 13; Cicero, De Legibus, ii. 21; Plutarch, Numa, p. 132. He well remarks (note in loc.), that Tertullian,
by intimating that the heathen rites of the Februa will afford quite as satisfactory an answer to the apostle’s
question, as the Christian superstition alluded to, not only means no authorization of the said superstition for
himself, but expresses his belief that St. Paul’s only object was to gather some evidence for the great doctrine of
the resurrection from the faith which underlay the practice alluded to. In this respect, however, the heathen
festival would afford a much less pointed illustration; for though it was indeed a lustration for the dead, περὶ
νεκρῶν, and had for its object their happiness and welfare, it went no further than a vague notion of an indefinite
immortality, and it touched not the recovery of the body. There is therefore force in Tertullian’s si forte.</note>

we have shown, it is the body which becomes dead. What, then, shall they do who are baptized
for the body,5634 if the body5635 rises not again? We stand, then, on firm ground (when
we say) that5636 the next question which the apostle has discussed equally relates to the
body. But “some man will say, ‘How are the dead raised up? With what body do they
come?’”5637 Having established the doctrine of the resurrection which was denied, it was
natural5638 to discuss what would be the sort of body (in the resurrection), of which no one
had an idea. On this point we have other opponents with whom to engage. For Marcion
does not in any wise admit the resurrection of the flesh, and it is only the salvation of the
soul which he promises; consequently the question which he raises is not concerning the
sort of body, but the very substance thereof. Notwithstanding,5639 he is most plainly refuted
even from what the apostle advances respecting the quality of the body, in answer to those
who ask, “How are the dead raised up? with what body do they come?” For as he treated of
the sort of body, he of course ipso facto proclaimed in the argument that it was a body which
would rise again. Indeed, since he proposes as his examples “wheat grain, or some other
grain, to which God giveth a body, such as it hath pleased Him;”5640 since also he says, that
“to every seed is its own body;”5641 that, consequently,5642 “there is one kind of flesh of
men, whilst there is another of beasts, and (another) of birds; that there are also celestial
bodies and bodies terrestrial; and that there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the
moon, and another glory of the stars”5643—does he not therefore intimate that there is to
be5644 a resurrection of the flesh or body, which he illustrates by fleshly and corporeal
samples? Does he not also guarantee that the resurrection shall be accomplished by that
God from whom proceed all the (creatures which have served him for) examples? “So also,”
says he, “is the resurrection of the dead.”5645 How? Just as the grain, which is sown a body,
springs up a body. This sowing of the body he called the dissolving thereof in the ground,
“because it is sown in corruption,” (but “is raised) to honour and power.”5646 Now, just as

in the case of the grain, so here: to Him will belong the work in the revival of the body, who
ordered the process in the dissolution thereof. If, however, you remove the body from the
resurrection which you submitted to the dissolution, what becomes of the diversity in the
issue? Likewise, “although it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.”5647 Now,
although the natural principle of life5648 and the spirit have each a body proper to itself, so
that the “natural body” may fairly be taken5649 to signify the soul,5650 and “the spiritual
body” the spirit, yet that is no reason for supposing5651 the apostle to say that the soul is to
become spirit in the resurrection, but that the body (which, as being born along with the
soul, and as retaining its life by means of the soul,5652 admits of being called animal (or
natural5653) will become spiritual, since it rises through the Spirit to an eternal life. In short,
since it is not the soul, but the flesh which is “sown in corruption,” when it turns to decay
in the ground, it follows that (after such dissolution) the soul is no longer the natural body,
but the flesh, which was the natural body, (is the subject of the future change), forasmuch
as of a natural body it is made a spiritual body, as he says further down, “That was not first
which is spiritual.”5654 For to this effect he just before remarked of Christ Himself: “The
first man Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.”5655
Our heretic, however, in the excess of his folly, being unwilling that the statement should
remain in this shape, altered “last Adam” into “last Lord;”5656 because he feared, of course,
that if he allowed the Lord to be the last (or second) Adam, we should contend that Christ,
being the second Adam, must needs belong to that God who owned also the first Adam.
But the falsification is transparent. For why is there a first Adam, unless it be that there is
also a second Adam? For things are not classed together unless they be severally alike, and
have an identity of either name, or substance, or origin.5657 Now, although among things
which are even individually diverse, one must be first and another last, yet they must have

this first in nature.5658 It is, however, not like the first in nature, when it is not the work of
the same author. In like manner (the heretic) will be refuted also with the word “man: ”
“The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.”5659 Now,
since the first was a man, how can there be a second, unless he is a man also? Or, else, if the
second is “Lord,” was the first “Lord” also?5660 It is, however, quite enough for me, that in
his Gospel he admits the Son of man to be both Christ and Man; so that he will not be able
to deny Him (in this passage), in the “Adam” and the “man” (of the apostle). What follows
will also be too much for him. For when the apostle says, “As is the earthy,” that is, man,
“such also are they that are earthy”—men again, of course; “therefore as is the heavenly,”
meaning the Man, from heaven, “such are the men also that are heavenly.”5661 For he could
not possibly have opposed to earthly men any heavenly beings that were not men also; his
object being the more accurately to distinguish their state and expectation by using this
name in common for them both. For in respect of their present state and their future expectation
he calls men earthly and heavenly, still reserving their parity of name, according as
they are reckoned (as to their ultimate condition5662) in Adam or in Christ. Therefore, when
exhorting them to cherish the hope of heaven, he says: “As we have borne the image of the
earthy, so let us also bear the image of the heavenly,”5663—language which relates not to
any condition of resurrection life, but to the rule of the present time. He says, Let us bear,
as a precept; not We shall bear, in the sense of a promise—wishing us to walk even as he
himself was walking, and to put off the likeness of the earthly, that is, of the old man, in the
works of the flesh. For what are this next words? “Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and
blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.”5664 He means the works of the flesh and blood,

which, in his Epistle to the Galatians, deprive men of the kingdom of God.5665 In other
passages also he is accustomed to put the natural condition instead of the works that are
done therein, as when he says, that “they who are in the flesh cannot please God.”5666 Now,
when shall we be able to please God except whilst we are in this flesh? There is, I imagine,
no other time wherein a man can work. If, however, whilst we are even naturally living in
the flesh, we yet eschew the deeds of the flesh, then we shall not be in the flesh; since, although
we are not absent from the substance of the flesh, we are notwithstanding strangers to the
sin thereof. Now, since in the word flesh we are enjoined to put off, not the substance, but
the works of the flesh, therefore in the use of the same word the kingdom of God is denied
to the works of the flesh, not to the substance thereof. For not that is condemned in which
evil is done, but only the evil which is done in it. To administer poison is a crime, but the
cup in which it is given is not guilty. So the body is the vessel of the works of the flesh, whilst
the soul which is within it mixes the poison of a wicked act. How then is it, that the soul,
which is the real author of the works of the flesh, shall attain to5667 the kingdom of God,
after the deeds done in the body have been atoned for, whilst the body, which was nothing
but (the soul’s) ministering agent, must remain in condemnation? Is the cup to be punished,
but the poisoner to escape? Not that we indeed claim the kingdom of God for the flesh: all
we do is, to assert a resurrection for the substance thereof, as the gate of the kingdom through
which it is entered. But the resurrection is one thing, and the kingdom is another. The resurrection
is first, and afterwards the kingdom. We say, therefore, that the flesh rises again,
but that when changed it obtains the kingdom. “For the dead shall be raised incorruptible,”
even those who had been corruptible when their bodies fell into decay; “and we shall be
changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.5668 For this corruptible”—and as he spake,
the apostle seemingly pointed to his own flesh—“must put on incorruption, and this mortal
must put on immortality,”5669 in order, indeed, that it may be rendered a fit substance for
the kingdom of God. “For we shall be like the angels.”5670 This will be the perfect change
of our flesh—only after its resurrection.5671 Now if, on the contrary,5672 there is to be no
flesh, how then shall it put on incorruption and immortality? Having then become something
else by its change, it will obtain the kingdom of God, no longer the (old) flesh and blood,

but the body which God shall have given it. Rightly then does the apostle declare, “Flesh
and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God;”5673 for this (honour) does he ascribe to the
changed condition5674 which ensues on the resurrection. Since, therefore, shall then be accomplished
the word which was written by the Creator, “O death, where is thy victory”—or
thy struggle?5675 “O death, where is thy sting?”5676—written, I say, by the Creator, for He
wrote them by His prophet5677—to Him will belong the gift, that is, the kingdom, who
proclaimed the word which is to be accomplished in the kingdom. And to none other God
does he tell us that “thanks” are due, for having enabled us to achieve “the victory” even
over death, than to Him from whom he received the very expression5678 of the exulting and

Not Reprehensible on Marcion’s Principles. The Jews Guilty in Rejecting the
Christ of the Creator. Satan, the God of This World. The Treasure in Earthen
Vessels Explained Against Marcion. The Creator’s Relation to These Vessels,
I.e. Our Bodies.</head>
<p>If, owing to the fault of human error, the word God has become a common name (since
in the world there are said and believed to be “gods many”5679), yet “the blessed God,” (who
is “the Father) of our Lord Jesus Christ,”5680 will be understood to be no other God than
the Creator, who both blessed all things (that He had made), as you find in Genesis,5681 and
is Himself “blessed by all things,” as Daniel tells us.5682 Now, if the title of Father may be
claimed for (Marcion’s) sterile god, how much more for the Creator? To none other than
Him is it suitable, who is also “the Father of mercies,”5683 and (in the prophets) has been
described as “full of compassion, and gracious, and plenteous in mercy.”5684 In Jonah you
find the signal act of His mercy, which He showed to the praying Ninevites.5685 How inflexible
was He at the tears of Hezekiah!5686 How ready to forgive Ahab, the husband of Jezebel,
the blood of Naboth, when he deprecated His anger.5687 How prompt in pardoning David
on his confession of his sin5688—preferring, indeed, the sinner’s repentance to his death,
of course because of His gracious attribute of mercy.5689 Now, if Marcion’s god has exhibited
or proclaimed any such thing as this, I will allow him to be “the Father of mercies.” Since,
however, he ascribes to him this title only from the time he has been revealed, as if he were
the father of mercies from the time only when he began to liberate the human race, then we
on our side, too,5690 adopt the same precise date of his alleged revelation; but it is that we

may deny him! It is then not competent to him to ascribe any quality to his god, whom indeed
he only promulged by the fact of such an ascription; for only if it were previously evident
that his god had an existence, could he be permitted to ascribe an attribute to him. The
ascribed attribute is only an accident; but accidents5691 are preceded by the statement of
the thing itself of which they are predicated, especially when another claims the attribute
which is ascribed to him who has not been previously shown to exist. Our denial of his existence
will be all the more peremptory, because of the fact that the attribute which is alleged
in proof of it belongs to that God who has been already revealed. Therefore “the New Testament”
will appertain to none other than Him who promised it—if not “its letter, yet its
spirit;”5692 and herein will lie its newness. Indeed, He who had engraved its letter in stones
is the same as He who had said of its spirit, “I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh.”5693
Even if “the letter killeth, yet the Spirit giveth life;”5694 and both belong to Him who says:
“I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal.”5695 We have already made good the Creator’s
claim to this twofold character of judgment and goodness5696—“killing in the letter” through
the law, and “quickening in the Spirit” through the Gospel. Now these attributes, however
different they be, cannot possibly make two gods; for they have already (in the prevenient
dispensation of the Old Testament) been found to meet in One.5697 He alludes to Moses’
veil, covered with which “his face could not be stedfastly seen by the children of Israel.”5698
Since he did this to maintain the superiority of the glory of the New Testament, which is
permanent in its glory, over that of the Old, “which was to be done away,”5699 this fact gives
support to my belief which exalts the Gospel above the law and you must look well to it that
it does not even more than this. For only there is superiority possible where was previously
the thing over which superiority can be affirmed. But then he says, “But their minds were
blinded”5700—of the world; certainly not the Creator’s mind, but the minds of the people
which are in the world.5701 Of Israel he says, Even unto this day the same veil is upon their

heart;”5702 showing that the veil which was on the face of Moses was a figure of the veil
which is on the heart of the nation still; because even now Moses is not seen by them in
heart, just as he was not then seen by them in eye. But what concern has Paul with the veil
which still obscures Moses from their view, if the Christ of the Creator, whom Moses predicted,
is not yet come? How are the hearts of the Jews represented as still covered and
veiled, if the predictions of Moses relating to Christ, in whom it was their duty to believe
through him, are as yet unfulfilled? What had the apostle of a strange Christ to complain
of, if the Jews failed in understanding the mysterious announcements of their own God,
unless the veil which was upon their hearts had reference to that blindness which concealed
from their eyes the Christ of Moses? Then, again, the words which follow, But when it shall
turn to the Lord, the evil shall be taken away,”5703 properly refer to the Jew, over whose
gaze Moses’ veil is spread, to the effect that, when he is turned to the faith of Christ, he will
understand how Moses spoke of Christ. But how shall the veil of the Creator be taken away
by the Christ of another god, whose mysteries the Creator could not possibly have
veiled—unknown mysteries, as they were of an unknown god? So he says that “we now with
open face” (meaning the candour of the heart, which in the Jews had been covered with a
veil), “beholding Christ, are changed into the same image, from that glory” (wherewith
Moses was transfigured as by the glory of the Lord) “to another glory.”5704 By thus setting
forth the glory which illumined the person of Moses from his interview with God, and the
veil which concealed the same from the infirmity of the people, and by superinducing
thereupon the revelation and the glory of the Spirit in the person of Christ—“even as,” to
use his words, “by the Spirit of the Lord”5705—he testifies that the whole Mosaic system5706
was a figure of Christ, of whom the Jews indeed were ignorant, but who is known to us
Christians. We are quite aware that some passages are open to ambiguity, from the way in
which they are read, or else from their punctuation, when there is room for these two causes
of ambiguity. The latter method has been adopted by Marcion, by reading the passage which
follows, “in whom the God of this world,”5707 as if it described the Creator as the God of
this world, in order that he may, by these words, imply that there is another God for the
other world. We, however, say that the passage ought to be punctuated with a comma after

God, to this effect: “In whom God hath blinded the eyes of the unbelievers of this world.”5708
“In whom” means the Jewish unbelievers, from some of whom the gospel is still hidden
under Moses’ veil. Now it is these whom God had threatened for “loving Him indeed with
the lip, whilst their heart was far from Him,”5709 in these angry words: “Ye shall hear with
your ears, and not understand; and see with your eyes, but not perceive;”5710 and, “If ye will
not believe, ye shall not understand;”5711 and again, “I will take away the wisdom of their
wise men, and bring to nought5712 the understanding of their prudent ones.” But these
words, of course, He did not pronounce against them for concealing the gospel of the unknown
God. At any rate, if there is a God of this world,5713 He blinds the heart of the unbelievers
of this world, because they have not of their own accord recognised His Christ,
who ought to be understood from His Scriptures.5714 Content with my advantage, I can
willingly refrain from noticing to any greater length5715 this point of ambiguous punctuation,
so as not to give my adversary any advantage,5716 indeed, I might have wholly omitted the
discussion. A simpler answer I shall find ready to hand in interpreting “the god of this world”
of the devil, who once said, as the prophet describes him: “I will be like the Most High; I
will exalt my throne in the clouds.”5717 The whole superstition, indeed, of this world has
got into his hands,5718 so that he blinds effectually the hearts of unbelievers, and of none
more than the apostate Marcion’s. Now he did not observe how much this clause of the
sentence made against him: “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness,
<note type="footnote">5708 He would stop off the phrase τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου from ὁ Θεὸς, and remove it to the end of the sentence
as a qualification of τῶν ἀπίστων. He adds another interpretation just afterwards, which, we need not say, is
both more consistent with the sense of the passage and with the consensus of Christian writers of all ages, although
“it is historically curious” (as Dean Alford has remarked) “that Irenæus [Hæres. iv. 48, Origen, Tertullian (v. 11,
contra Marcion)], Chrysostom, OEcumenius, Theodoret, Theophylact, all repudiate, in their zeal against the
Manichæans, the grammatical rendering, and take τῶν ἀπίστων τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου together” (Greek Testament,

hath shined in our hearts, to (give) the light of the knowledge (of His glory) in the face of
(Jesus) Christ.”5719 Now who was it that said; “Let there be light?”5720 And who was it that
said to Christ concerning giving light to the world: “I have set Thee as a light to the Gentiles”
5721—to them, that is, “who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death?”5722 (None
else, surely, than He), to whom the Spirit in the Psalm answers, in His foresight of the future,
saying, “The light of Thy countenance, O Lord, hath been displayed upon us.”5723 Now the
countenance (or person5724) of the Lord here is Christ. Wherefore the apostle said above:
“Christ, who is the image of God.”5725 Since Christ, then, is the person of the Creator, who
said, “Let there be light,” it follows that Christ and the apostles, and the gospel, and the veil,
and Moses—nay, the whole of the dispensations—belong to the God who is the Creator of
this world, according to the testimony of the clause (above adverted to), and certainly not
to him who never said, “Let there be light.” I here pass over discussion about another epistle,
which we hold to have been written to the Ephesians, but the heretics to the Laodiceans. In
it he tells5726 them to remember, that at the time when they were Gentiles they were without
Christ, aliens from (the commonwealth of) Israel, without intercourse, without the covenants
and any hope of promise, nay, without God, even in his own world,5727 as the Creator
thereof. Since therefore he said, that the Gentiles were without God, whilst their god was
the devil, not the Creator, it is clear that he must be understood to be the lord of this world,
whom the Gentiles received as their god—not the Creator, of whom they were in ignorance.
But how does it happen, that “the treasure which we have in these earthen vessels of ours”5728
should not be regarded as belonging to the God who owns the vessels? Now since God’s
glory is, that so great a treasure is contained in earthen vessels, and since these earthen vessels
are of the Creator’s make, it follows that the glory is the Creator’s; nay, since these vessels
of His smack so much of the excellency of the power of God, that power itself must be His
also! Indeed, all these things have been consigned to the said “earthen vessels” for the very
purpose that His excellence might be manifested forth. Henceforth, then, the rival god will
have no claim to the glory, and consequently none to the power. Rather, dishonour and

weakness will accrue to him, because the earthen vessels with which he had nothing to do
have received all the excellency! Well, then, if it be in these very earthen vessels that he tells
us we have to endure so great sufferings,5729 in which we bear about with us the very dying
of God,5730 (Marcion’s) god is really ungrateful and unjust, if he does not mean to restore
this same substance of ours at the resurrection, wherein so much has been endured in loyalty
to him, in which Christ’s very death is borne about, wherein too the excellency of his power
is treasured.5731 For he gives prominence to the statement, “That the life also of Christ may
be manifested in our body,”5732 as a contrast to the preceding, that His death is borne about
in our body. Now of what life of Christ does he here speak? Of that which we are now living?
Then how is it, that in the words which follow he exhorts us not to the things which are
seen and are temporal, but to those which are not seen and are eternal5733—in other words,
not to the present, but to the future? But if it be of the future life of Christ that he speaks,
intimating that it is to be made manifest in our body,5734 then he has clearly predicted the
resurrection of the flesh.5735 He says, too, that “our outward man perishes,”5736 not meaning
by an eternal perdition after death, but by labours and sufferings, in reference to which he
previously said, “For which cause we will not faint.”5737 Now, when he adds of “the inward
man” also, that it “is renewed day by day,” he demonstrates both issues here—the wasting
away of the body by the wear and tear5738 of its trials, and the renewal of the soul5739 by its
contemplation of the promises.</p>

<p>As to the house of this our earthly dwelling-place, when he says that “we have an
eternal home in heaven, not made with hands,”5740 he by no means would imply that, because
it was built by the Creator’s hand, it must perish in a perpetual dissolution after death.5741
He treats of this subject in order to offer consolation against the fear of death and the dread
of this very dissolution, as is even more manifest from what follows, when he adds, that “in
this tabernacle of our earthly body we do groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with

be found naked;” in other words, shall regain that of which we have been divested, even our
body. And again he says: “We that are in this tabernacle do groan, not as if we were oppressed5744
with an unwillingness to be unclothed, but (we wish) to be clothed upon.”5745
He here says expressly, what he touched but lightly5746 in his first epistle, where he wrote:)
“The dead shall be raised incorruptible (meaning those who had undergone mortality), “and
we shall be changed” (whom God shall find to be yet in the flesh).5747 Both those shall be
raised incorruptible, because they shall regain their body—and that a renewed one, from
which shall come their incorruptibility; and these also shall, in the crisis of the last moment,
and from their instantaneous death, whilst encountering the oppressions of anti-christ,
undergo a change, obtaining therein not so much a divestiture of body as “a clothing upon”
with the vesture which is from heaven.5748 So that whilst these shall put on over their
(changed) body this, heavenly raiment, the dead also shall for their part5749 recover their
body, over which they too have a supervesture to put on, even the incorruption of heaven;5750

because of these it was that he said: “This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this
mortal must put on immortality.”5751 The one put on this (heavenly) apparel,5752 when
they recover their bodies; the others put it on as a supervesture,5753 when they indeed hardly
lose them (in the suddenness of their change). It was accordingly not without good reason
that he described them as “not wishing indeed to be unclothed,” but (rather as wanting) “to
be clothed upon;”5754 in other words, as wishing not to undergo death, but to be surprised
into life,5755 “that this moral (body) might be swallowed up of life,”5756 by being rescued
from death in the supervesture of its changed state. This is why he shows us how much
better it is for us not to be sorry, if we should be surprised by death, and tells us that we even
hold of God “the earnest of His Spirit”5757 (pledged as it were thereby to have “the clothing
upon,” which is the object of our hope), and that “so long as we are in the flesh, we are absent
from the Lord;”5758 moreover, that we ought on this account to prefer5759 “rather to be
absent from the body and to be present with the Lord,”5760 and so to be ready to meet even
death with joy. In this view it is that he informs us how “we must all appear before the
judgement-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according
as he hath done either good or bad.”5761 Since, however, there is then to be a retribution
according to men’s merits, how will any be able to reckon with5762 God? But by mentioning
both the judgment-seat and the distinction between works good and bad, he sets before us
a Judge who is to award both sentences,5763 and has thereby affirmed that all will have to
be present at the tribunal in their bodies. For it will be impossible to pass sentence except
on the body, for what has been done in the body. God would be unjust, if any one were not
punished or else rewarded in that very condition,5764 wherein the merit was itself achieved.

all things are become new;”5765 and so is accomplished the prophecy of Isaiah.5766 When
also he (in a later passage) enjoins us “to cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and
blood”5767 (since this substance enters not the kingdom of God5768); when, again, he “espouses
the church as a chaste virgin to Christ,”5769 a spouse to a spouse in very deed,5770
an image cannot be combined and compared with what is opposed to the real nature of the
thing (with which it is compared). So when he designates “false apostles, deceitful workers
transforming themselves” into likenesses of himself,5771 of course by their hypocrisy, he
charges them with the guilt of disorderly conversation, rather than of false doctrine.5772
The contrariety, therefore, was one of conduct, not of gods.5773 If “Satan himself, too, is
transformed into an angel of light,”5774 such an assertion must not be used to the prejudice
of the Creator. The Creator is not an angel, but God. Into a god of light, and not an angel
of light, must Satan then have been said to be transformed, if he did not mean to call him
“the angel,” which both we and Marcion know him to be. On Paradise is the title of a treatise
of ours, in which is discussed all that the subject admits of.5775 I shall here simply wonder,
in connection with this matter, whether a god who has no dispensation of any kind on earth
could possibly have a paradise to call his own—without perchance availing himself of the
paradise of the Creator, to use it as he does His world—much in the character of a mendicant.
5776 And yet of the removal of a man from earth to heaven we have an instance afforded
us by the Creator in Elijah.5777 But what will excite my surprise still more is the case (next
supposed by Marcion), that a God so good and gracious, and so averse to blows and cruelty,
should have suborned the angel Satan—not his own either, but the Creator’s—“to buffet”
the apostle,5778 and then to have refused his request, when thrice entreated to liberate him!

It would seem, therefore, that Marcion’s god imitates the Creator’s conduct, who is an enemy
to the proud, even “putting down the mighty from their seats.”5779 Is he then the same God
as He who gave Satan power over the person of Job that his “strength might be made perfect
in weakness?”5780 How is it that the censurer of the Galatians5781 still retains the very formula
of the law: “In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established?”5782

using sharpness in their presence!”5784 Deny now, O heretic, (at your cost,) that your god

<head>Chapter XIII.—The Epistle to the Romans. St. Paul Cannot Help Using Phrases
Which Bespeak the Justice of God, Even When He is Eulogizing the Mercies of
the Gospel. Marcion Particularly Hard in Mutilation of This Epistle. Yet Our
Author Argues on Common Ground. The Judgment at Last Will Be in Accordance
with the Gospel. The Justified by Faith Exhorted to Have Peace with God.
The Administration of the Old and the New Dispensations in One and the Same
Hand.</head>
<p>Since my little work is approaching its termination,5785 I must treat but briefly the
points which still occur, whilst those which have so often turned up must be put aside. I
regret still to have to contend about the law—after I have so often proved that its replacement
(by the gospel)5786 affords no argument for another god, predicted as it was indeed in Christ,
and in the Creator’s own plans5787 ordained for His Christ. (But I must revert to that discussion)
so far as (the apostle leads me, for) this very epistle looks very much as if it abrogated5788
the law. We have, however, often shown before now that God is declared by the
apostle to be a Judge; and that in the Judge is implied an Avenger; and in the Avenger, the
Creator. And so in the passage where he says: “I am not ashamed of the gospel (of Christ):
for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also
to the Greek; for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith,”5789 he
undoubtedly ascribes both the gospel and salvation to Him whom (in accordance with our
heretic’s own distinction) I have called the just God, not the good one. It is He who removes
(men) from confidence in the law to faith in the gospel—that is to say,5790 His own law and
His own gospel. When, again, he declares that “the wrath (of God) is revealed from heaven
against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness,”
5791 (I ask) the wrath of what God? Of the Creator certainly. The truth, therefore, will
be His, whose is also the wrath, which has to be revealed to avenge the truth. Likewise, when
adding, “We are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth,”5792 he both vindicated
that wrath from which comes this judgment for the truth, and at the same time afforded
another proof that the truth emanates from the same God whose wrath he attested, by wit-

nessing to His judgment. Marcion’s averment is quite a different matter, that5793 the Creator
in anger avenges Himself on the truth of the rival god which had been detained in unrighteousness.
But what serious gaps Marcion has made in this epistle especially, by withdrawing
whole passages at his will, will be clear from the unmutilated text of our own copy.5794 It is
enough for my purpose to accept in evidence of its truth what he has seen fit to leave unerased,
strange instances as they are also of his negligence and blindness. If, then, God will
judge the secrets of men—both of those who have sinned in the law, and of those who have
sinned without law (inasmuch as they who know not the law yet do by nature the things
contained in the law)5795—surely the God who shall judge is He to whom belong both the
law, and that nature which is the rule5796 to them who know not the law. But how will He
conduct this judgment? “According to my gospel,” says (the apostle), “by (Jesus) Christ.”5797
So that both the gospel and Christ must be His, to whom appertain the law and the nature
which are to be vindicated by the gospel and Christ—even at that judgment of God which,
as he previously said, was to be according to truth.5798 The wrath, therefore, which is to
vindicate truth, can only be revealed from heaven by the God of wrath;5799 so that this
sentence, which is quite in accordance with that previous one wherein the judgment is declared
to be the Creator’s,5800 cannot possibly be ascribed to another god who is not a judge,
and is incapable of wrath. It is only consistent in Him amongst whose attributes are found
the judgment and the wrath of which I am speaking, and to whom of necessity must also
appertain the media whereby these attributes are to be carried into effect, even the gospel
and Christ. Hence his invective against the transgressors of the law, who teach that men
should not steal, and yet practise theft themselves.5801 (This invective he utters) in perfect
homage5802 to the law of God, not as if he meant to censure the Creator Himself with having
commanded5803 a fraud to be practised against the Egyptians to get their gold and silver at
the very time when He was forbidding men to steal,5804—adopting such methods as they

are apt (shamelessly) to charge upon Him in other particulars also. Are we then to suppose5805
that the apostle abstained through fear from openly calumniating God, from whom
notwithstanding He did not hesitate to withdraw men? Well, but he had gone so far in his
censure of the Jews, as to point against them the denunciation of the prophet, “Through
you the name of God is blasphemed (among the Gentiles).”5806 But how absurd, that he
should himself blaspheme Him for blaspheming whom he upbraids them as evil-doers! He
prefers even circumcision of heart to neglect of it in the flesh. Now it is quite within the
purpose of the God of the law that circumcision should be that of the heart, not in the flesh;
in the spirit, and not in the letter.5807 Since this is the circumcision recommended by
Jeremiah: “Circumcise (yourselves to the Lord, and take away) the foreskins of your
heart;”5808 and even of Moses: “Circumcise, therefore, the hardness of your heart,”5809—the
Spirit which circumcises the heart will proceed from Him who prescribed the letter also
which clips5810 the flesh; and “the Jew which is one inwardly” will be a subject of the selfsame
God as he also is who is “a Jew outwardly;”5811 because the apostle would have preferred
not to have mentioned a Jew at all, unless he were a servant of the God of the Jews. It was
once5812 the law; now it is “the righteousness of God which is by the faith of (Jesus)
Christ.”5813 What means this distinction? Has your god been subserving the interests of the
Creator’s dispensation, by affording time to Him and to His law? Is the “Now” in the hands
of Him to whom belonged the “Then”? Surely, then, the law was His, whose is now the
righteousness of God. It is a distinction of dispensations, not of gods. He enjoins those who
are justified by faith in Christ and not by the law to have peace with God.5814 With what

God? Him whose enemies we have never, in any dispensation,5815 been? Or Him against
whom we have rebelled, both in relation to His written law and His law of nature? Now, as
peace is only possible towards Him with whom there once was war, we shall be both justified
by Him, and to Him also will belong the Christ, in whom we are justified by faith, and
through whom alone God’s5816 enemies can ever be reduced to peace. “Moreover,” says
he, “the law entered, that the offence might abound.”5817 And wherefore this? “In order,”
he says, “that (where sin abounded), grace might much more abound.”5818 Whose grace, if
not of that God from whom also came the law? Unless it be, forsooth, that5819 the Creator
intercalated His law for the mere purpose of5820 producing some employment for the grace
of a rival god, an enemy to Himself (I had almost said, a god unknown to Him), “that as sin
had” in His own dispensation5821 “reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through
righteousness unto (eternal) life by Jesus Christ,”5822 His own antagonist! For this (I suppose
it was, that) the law of the Creator had “concluded all under sin,”5823 and had brought in
“all the world as guilty (before God),” and had “stopped every mouth,”5824 so that none
could glory through it, in order that grace might be maintained to the glory of the Christ,
not of the Creator, but of Marcion! I may here anticipate a remark about the substance of
Christ, in the prospect of a question which will now turn up. For he says that “we are dead
to the law.”5825 It may be contended that Christ’s body is indeed a body, but not exactly5826
flesh. Now, whatever may be the substance, since he mentions “the body of Christ,”5827

whom he immediately after states to have been “raised from the dead,”5828 none other body
can be understood than that of the flesh,5829 in respect of which the law was called (the law)
of death.5830 But, behold, he bears testimony to the law, and excuses it on the ground of
sin: “What shall we say, therefore? Is the law sin? God forbid.”5831 Fie on you, Marcion.
“God forbid!” (See how) the apostle recoils from all impeachment of the law. I, however,
have no acquaintance with sin except through the law.5832 But how high an encomium of
the law (do we obtain) from this fact, that by it there comes to light the latent presence of
sin!5833 It was not the law, therefore, which led me astray, but “sin, taking occasion by the
commandment.”5834 Why then do you, (O Marcion,) impute to the God of the law what
His apostle dares not impute even to the law itself? Nay, he adds a climax: “The law is holy,
and its commandment just and good.”5835 Now if he thus reverences the Creator’s law, I
am at a loss to know how he can destroy the Creator Himself. Who can draw a distinction,
and say that there are two gods, one just and the other good, when He ought to be believed
to be both one and the other, whose commandment is both “just and good?” Then, again,
when affirming the law to be “spiritual”5836 he thereby implies that it is prophetic, and that
it is figurative. Now from even this circumstance I am bound to conclude that Christ was
predicted by the law but figuratively, so that indeed He could not be recognised by all the
Jews.</p>

<p>If the Father “sent His Son in the likeness of sinful flesh,”5837 it must not therefore be
said that the flesh which He seemed to have was but a phantom. For he in a previous verse
ascribed sin to the flesh, and made it out to be “the law of sin dwelling in his members,” and
“warring against the law of the mind.”5838 On this account, therefore, (does he mean to say
that) the Son was sent in the likeness of sinful flesh, that He might redeem this sinful flesh
by a like substance, even a fleshly one, which bare a resemblance to sinful flesh, although it
was itself free from sin. Now this will be the very perfection of divine power to effect the
salvation (of man) in a nature like his own.5839 For it would be no great matter if the Spirit
of God remedied the flesh; but when a flesh, which is the very copy5840 of the sinning substance—
itself flesh also—only without sin, (effects the remedy, then doubtless it is a great
thing). The likeness, therefore, will have reference to the quality5841 of the sinfulness, and
not to any falsity5842 of the substance. Because he would not have added the attribute “sinful,”
5843 if he meant the “likeness” to be so predicated of the substance as to deny the verity
thereof; in that case he would only have used the word “flesh,” and omitted the “sinful.” But
inasmuch as he has put the two together, and said “sinful flesh,” (or “flesh of sin,”)5844 he

ἁμαρτίας, amounting to “flesh of sin,” i.e. (as Dean Alford interprets it) “the flesh whose attribute and character
is sin.” “The words ἐν ὁμοιώματι σαρκὸς ἁμαρτίας, De Wette observes, appear almost to border on Docetism,
but in reality contain a perfectly true and consistent sentiment; σὰρξ ἁμαρτίας; is flesh, or human nature, possessed
with sin.…The likeness, predicated in Rom. viii. 3, must be referred not only to σάρξ, but also to the epithet τῆς
ἁμαρτίας” (Greek Testament, in loc.).

has both affirmed the substance, that is, the flesh and referred the likeness to the fault of the
substance, that is, to its sin. But even suppose5845 that the likeness was predicated of the
substance, the truth of the said substance will not be thereby denied. Why then call the true
substance like? Because it is indeed true, only not of a seed of like condition5846 with our
own; but true still, as being of a nature5847 not really unlike ours.5848 And again, in contrary
things there is no likeness. Thus the likeness of flesh would not be called spirit, because flesh
is not susceptible of any likeness to spirit; but it would be called phantom, if it seemed to be
that which it really was not. It is, however, called likeness, since it is what it seems to be.
Now it is (what it seems to be), because it is on a par with the other thing (with which it is
compared).5849 But a phantom, which is merely such and nothing else,5850 is not a likeness.
The apostle, however, himself here comes to our aid; for, while explaining in what sense he
would not have us “live in the flesh,” although in the flesh—even by not living in the works
of the flesh5851—he shows that when he wrote the words, “Flesh and blood cannot inherit
the kingdom of God,”5852 it was not with the view of condemning the substance (of the
flesh), but the works thereof; and because it is possible for these not to be committed by us
whilst we are still in the flesh, they will therefore be properly chargeable,5853 not on the
substance of the flesh, but on its conduct. Likewise, if “the body indeed is dead because of
sin” (from which statement we see that not the death of the soul is meant, but that of the
body), “but the spirit is life because of righteousness,”5854 it follows that this life accrues to

of a (father’s) seed, as in the case of ourselves; not of qualities, because these have not in Him the like condition

that which incurred death because of sin, that is, as we have just seen, the body. Now the
body5855is only restored to him who had lost it; so that the resurrection of the dead implies
the resurrection of their bodies. He accordingly subjoins: “He that raised up Christ from
the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies.”5856 In these words he both affirmed the
resurrection of the flesh (without which nothing can rightly be called5857 body, nor can
anything be properly regarded as mortal), and proved the bodily substance of Christ; inasmuch
as our own mortal bodies will be quickened in precisely the same way as He was
raised; and that was in no other way than in the body. I have here a very wide gulf of expunged
Scripture to leap across;5858 however, I alight on the place where the apostle bears record
of Israel “that they have a zeal of God”—their own God, of course—“but not according to
knowledge. For,” says he, “being ignorant of (the righteousness of) God, and going about
to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness
of God; for Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.”5859
Hereupon we shall be confronted with an argument of the heretic, that the Jews were ignorant
of the superior God,5860 since, in opposition to him, they set up their own righteousness—that
is, the righteousness of their law—not receiving Christ, the end (or finisher) of the law. But
how then is it that he bears testimony to their zeal for their own God, if it is not in respect
of the same God that he upbraids them for their ignorance? They were affected indeed with
zeal for God, but it was not an intelligent zeal: they were, in fact, ignorant of Him, because
they were ignorant of His dispensations by Christ, who was to bring about the consummation
of the law; and in this way did they maintain their own righteousness in opposition to Him.
But so does the Creator Himself testify to their ignorance concerning Him: “Israel hath not
known me; my people have not understood me;”5861 and as to their preferring the establishment
of their own righteousness, (the Creator again describes them as) “teaching for doctrines
the commandments of men;”5862 moreover, as “having gathered themselves together against

the Lord and against His Christ”5863—from ignorance of Him, of course. Now nothing can
be expounded of another god which is applicable to the Creator; otherwise the apostle would
not have been just in reproaching the Jews with ignorance in respect of a god of whom they
knew nothing. For where had been their sin, if they only maintained the righteousness of
their own God against one of whom they were ignorant? But he exclaims: “O the depth of
the riches and the wisdom of God; how unsearchable also are His ways!”5864 Whence this
outburst of feeling? Surely from the recollection of the Scriptures, which he had been previously
turning over, as well as from his contemplation of the mysteries which he had been
setting forth above, in relation to the faith of Christ coming from the law.5865 If Marcion
had an object in his erasures,5866 why does his apostle utter such an exclamation, because
his god has no riches for him to contemplate? So poor and indigent was he, that he created
nothing, predicted nothing—in short, possessed nothing; for it was into the world of another
God that he descended. The truth is, the Creator’s resources and riches, which once had
been hidden, were now disclosed. For so had He promised: “I will give to them treasures
which have been hidden, and which men have not seen will I open to them.”5867 Hence,
then, came the exclamation, “O the depth of the riches and the wisdom of God!” For His
treasures were now opening out. This is the purport of what Isaiah said, and of (the apostle’s
own) subsequent quotation of the self-same passage, of the prophet: “Who hath known the
mind of the Lord? or who hath been His counsellor? Who hath first given to Him, and it
shall be recompensed to him again?”5868 Now, (Marcion,) since you have expunged so much
from the Scriptures, why did you retain these words, as if they too were not the Creator’s
words? But come now, let us see without mistake5869 the precepts of your new god: “Abhor
that which is evil, and cleave to that which is good.”5870 Well, is the precept different in the
Creator’s teaching? “Take away the evil from you, depart from it, and be doing good.”5871

of the same import as: “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self?”5873 (Again, your apostle
says:) “Rejoicing in hope;”5874 that is, of God. So says the Creator’s Psalmist: “It is better to
hope in the Lord, than to hope even in princes.”5875 “Patient in tribulation.”5876 You have
(this in) the Psalm: “The Lord hear thee in the day of tribulation.”5877 “Bless, and curse
not,”5878 (says your apostle.) But what better teacher of this will you find than Him who
created all things, and blessed them? “Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low
estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.”5879 For against such a disposition Isaiah pronounces
a woe.5880 “Recompense to no man evil for evil.”5881 (Like unto which is the Creator’s
precept:) “Thou shalt not remember thy brother’s evil against thee.”5882 (Again:)
“Avenge not yourselves;”5883 for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the
Lord.”5884 “Live peaceably with all men.”5885 The retaliation of the law, therefore, permitted
not retribution for an injury; it rather repressed any attempt thereat by the fear of a recompense.
Very properly, then, did he sum up the entire teaching of the Creator in this precept
of His: “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.”5886 Now, if this is the recapitulation of
the law from the very law itself, I am at a loss to know who is the God of the law. I fear He
must be Marcion’s god (after all).5887 If also the gospel of Christ is fulfilled in this same

<head>Chapter XV.—The First Epistle to the Thessalonians. The Shorter Epistles Pungent
in Sense and Very Valuable. St. Paul Upbraids the Jews for the Death First of
Their Prophets and Then of Christ. This a Presumption that Both Christ and
the Prophets Pertained to the Same God. The Law of Nature, Which is in Fact
the Creator’s Discipline, and the Gospel of Christ Both Enjoin Chastity. The

Nature.</head>
<p>I shall not be sorry to bestow attention on the shorter epistles also. Even in brief works
there is much pungency.5892 The Jews had slain their prophets.5893 I may ask, What has
this to do with the apostle of the rival god, one so amiable withal, who could hardly be said
to condemn even the failings of his own people; and who, moreover, has himself some hand
in making away with the same prophets whom he is destroying? What injury did Israel
commit against him in slaying those whom he too has reprobated, since he was the first to
pass a hostile sentence on them? But Israel sinned against their own God. He upbraided
their iniquity to whom the injured God pertains; and certainly he is anything but the adversary
of the injured Deity. Else he would not have burdened them with the charge of killing even
the Lord, in the words, “Who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own prophets,” although
(the pronoun) their own be an addition of the heretics.5894 Now, what was there so very
acrimonious5895 in their killing Christ the proclaimer of the new god, after they had put to
death also the prophets of their own god? The fact, however, of their having slain the Lord
and His servants, is put as a case of climax.5896 Now, if it were the Christ of one god and
the prophets of another god whom they slew, he would certainly have placed the impious
crimes on the same level, instead of mentioning them in the way of a climax; but they did
not admit of being put on the same level: the climax, therefore, was only possible5897 by the
<note type="footnote">5892 Sapor. We have here a characteristic touch of his diligent and also intrepid spirit. Epiphanius says this
short epistle “was so entirely corrupted by Marcion, that he had himself selected nothing from it whereon to
found any refutations of him or of his doctrine.” Tertullian, however, was of a different mind; for he has made
it evident, that though there were alterations made by Marcion, yet sufficient was left untouched by him to show
the absurdity of his opinions. Epiphanius and Tertullian entertained, respectively, similar opinions of Marcion’s
treatment of the second epistle, which the latter discusses in the next chapter (Larder).</note>

sin having been in fact committed against one and the same Lord in the two respective circumstances.
5898 To one and the same Lord, then, belonged Christ and the prophets. What
that “sanctification of ours” is, which he declares to be “the will of God,” you may discover
from the opposite conduct which he forbids. That we should “abstain from fornication,”
not from marriage; that every one “should know how to possess his vessel in honour.”5899
In what way? “Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles.”5900 Concupiscence,
however, is not ascribed to marriage even among the Gentiles, but to extravagant, unnatural,
and enormous sins.5901 The law of nature5902 is opposed to luxury as well as to grossness
and uncleanness;5903 it does not forbid connubial intercourse, but concupiscence; and it
takes care of5904 our vessel by the honourable estate of matrimony. This passage (of the
apostle) I would treat in such a way as to maintain the superiority of the other and higher
sanctity, preferring continence and virginity to marriage, but by no means prohibiting the
latter. For my hostility is directed against5905 those who are for destroying the God of
marriage, not those who follow after chastity. He says that those who “remain unto the
coming of Christ,” along with “the dead in Christ, shall rise first,” being “caught up in the
clouds to meet the Lord in the air.”5906 I find it was in their foresight of all this, that the
heavenly intelligences gazed with admiration on “the Jerusalem which is above,”5907 and
by the mouth of Isaiah said long ago: “Who are these that fly as clouds, and as doves with
their young ones, unto me?”5908 Now, as Christ has prepared for us this ascension into
heaven, He must be the Christ of whom Amos5909 spoke: “It is He who builds His ascent
up to the heavens,”5910 even for Himself and His people. Now, from whom shall I expect
(the fulfilment of) all this, except from Him whom I have heard give the promise thereof?

What “spirit” does he forbid us to “quench,” and what “prophesyings” to “despise?”5911 Not
the Creator’s spirit, nor the Creator’s prophesyings, Marcion of course replies. For he has
already quenched and despised the thing which he destroys, and is unable to forbid what
he has despised.5912 It is then incumbent on Marcion now to display in his church that
spirit of his god which must not be quenched, and the prophesyings which must not be
despised. And since he has made such a display as he thinks fit, let him know that we shall
challenge it whatever it may be to the rule5913 of the grace and power of the Spirit and the
prophets—namely, to foretell the future, to reveal the secrets of the heart, and to explain
mysteries. And when he shall have failed to produce and give proof of any such criterion,
we will then on our side bring out both the Spirit and the prophecies of the Creator, which
utter predictions according to His will. Thus it will be clearly seen of what the apostle spoke,
even of those things which were to happen in the church of his God; and as long as He endures,
so long also does His Spirit work, and so long are His promises repeated.5914 Come
now, you who deny the salvation of the flesh, and who, whenever there occurs the specific
mention of body in a case of this sort,5915 interpret it as meaning anything rather than the
substance of the flesh, (tell me) how is it that the apostle has given certain distinct names
to all (our faculties), and has comprised them all in one prayer for their safety, desiring that
our “spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord and
Saviour (Jesus) Christ?”5916 Now he has here propounded the soul and the body as two
several and distinct things.5917 For although the soul has a kind of body of a quality of its

Clement of Alex., Origen, as well as Didymus of Alex., Gregory Nyssen., and Basil, held distinctly the threefold
nature. Our own divines, as is natural, are also divided in views. Bp. Bull, Hammond, and Jackson hold the trichotomy,

has its own peculiar appellation, not requiring the common designation of body. This is
left for “the flesh,” which having no proper name (in this passage), necessarily makes use
of the common designation. Indeed, I see no other substance in man, after spirit and soul,
to which the term body can be applied except “the flesh.” This, therefore, I understand to
be meant by the word “body”—as often as the latter is not specifically named. Much more

<p>We are obliged from time to time to recur to certain topics in order to affirm truths
which are connected with them. We repeat then here, that as the Lord is by the apostle
proclaimed5920 as the awarder of both weal and woe,5921 He must be either the Creator, or
(as Marcion would be loth to admit) One like the Creator—“with whom it is a righteous
thing to recompense tribulation to them who afflict us, and to ourselves, who are afflicted,
rest, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed as coming from heaven with the angels of His
might and in flaming fire.”5922 The heretic, however, has erased the flaming fire, no doubt
that he might extinguish all traces herein of our own God. But the folly of the obliteration
is clearly seen. For as the apostle declares that the Lord will come “to take vengeance on
them that know not God and that obey not the gospel, who,” he says, “shall be punished
with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His
power”5923—it follows that, as He comes to inflict punishment, He must require “the
flaming fire.” Thus on this consideration too we must, notwithstanding Marcion’s opposition,
conclude that Christ belongs to a God who kindles the flames5924 (of vengeance), and
therefore to the Creator, inasmuch as He takes vengeance on such as know not the Lord,
that is, on the heathen. For he has mentioned separately “those who obey not the gospel of
our Lord Jesus Christ,”5925 whether they be sinners among Christians or among Jews. Now,
to inflict punishment on the heathen, who very likely have never heard of the Gospel, is not
the function of that God who is naturally unknown, and who is revealed nowhere else than
in the Gospel, and therefore cannot be known by all men.5926 The Creator, however, ought
to be known even by (the light of) nature, for He may be understood from His works, and
may thereby become the object of a more widely spread knowledge. To Him, therefore, does

(apostle’s) phrase, “From the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power,”5927
he uses the words of Isaiah who for the express reason makes the self-same Lord “arise to
shake terribly the earth.”5928 Well, but who is the man of sin, the son of perdition,” who
must first be revealed before the Lord comes; “who opposeth and exalteth himself above all
that is called God, or that is worshipped; who is to sit in the temple of God, and boast himself
as being God?”5929 According indeed to our view, he is Antichrist; as it is taught us in both
the ancient and the new prophecies,5930 and especially by the Apostle John, who says that
“already many false prophets are gone out into the world,” the fore-runners of Antichrist,
who deny that Christ is come in the flesh,5931 and do not acknowledge5932 Jesus (to be the
Christ), meaning in God the Creator. According, however, to Marcion’s view, it is really
hard to know whether He might not be (after all) the Creator’s Christ; because according
to him He is not yet come. But whichsoever of the two it is, I want to know why he comes
“in all power, and with lying signs and wonders?”5933 “Because,” he says, “they received not
the love of the truth, that they might be saved; for which cause God shall send them an instinct
of delusion5934 (to believe a lie), that they all might be judged who believed not the truth,
but had pleasure in unrighteousness.”5935 If therefore he be Antichrist, (as we hold), and
comes according to the Creator’s purpose, it must be God the Creator who sends him to
fasten in their error those who did not believe the truth, that they might be saved; His likewise
must be the truth and the salvation, who avenges (the contempt of) them by sending error
as their substitute5936—that is, the Creator, to whom that very wrath is a fitting attribute,

which deceives with a lie those who are not captivated with truth. If, however, he is not
Antichrist, as we suppose (him to be) then He is the Christ of the Creator, as Marcion will
have it. In this case how happens it that he5937 can suborn the Creator’s Christ to avenge
his truth? But should he after all agree with us, that Antichrist is here meant, I must then
likewise ask how it is that he finds Satan, an angel of the Creator, necessary to his purpose?
Why, too, should Antichrist be slain by Him, whilst commissioned by the Creator to execute
the function5938 of inspiring men with their love of untruth? In short, it is incontestable
that the emissary,5939 and the truth, and the salvation belong to Him to whom also appertain
the wrath, and the jealousy,5940 and “the sending of the strong delusion,”5941 on those who
despise and mock, as well as upon those who are ignorant of Him; and therefore even
Marcion will now have to come down a step, and concede to us that his god is “a jealous
god.” (This being then an unquestionable position, I ask) which God has the greater right
to be angry? He, as I suppose, who from the beginning of all things has given to man, as
primary witnesses for the knowledge of Himself, nature in her (manifold) works, kindly
providences, plagues,5942 and indications (of His divinity),5943 but who in spite of all this
evidence has not been acknowledged; or he who has been brought out to view5944 once for
all in one only copy of the gospel—and even that without any sure authority—which actually
makes no secret of proclaiming another god? Now He who has the right of inflicting the
vengeance, has also sole claim to that which occasions5945 the vengeance, I mean the Gospel;
(in other words,) both the truth and (its accompanying) salvation. The charge, that “if any
would not work, neither should he eat,”5946 is in strict accordance with the precept of Him
who ordered that “the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn should not be muzzled.”5947</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.—The Epistle to the Laodiceans. The Proper Designation is to the
Ephesians. Recapitulation of All Things in Christ from the Beginning of the
Creation. No Room for Marcion’s Christ Here. Numerous Parallels Between
This Epistle and Passages in the Old Testament. The Prince of the Power of the
Air, and the God of This World—Who? Creation and Regeneration the Work
of One God. How Christ Has Made the Law Obsolete. A Vain Erasure of Marcion’s.
The Apostles as Well as the Prophets from the Creator.</head>
<p>We have it on the true tradition5948 of the Church, that this epistle was sent to the Ephe
sians, not to the Laodiceans. Marcion, however, was very desirous of giving it the new title
(of Laodicean),5949 as if he were extremely accurate in investigating such a point. But of
what consequence are the titles, since in writing to a certain church the apostle did in fact
write to all? It is certain that, whoever they were to whom he wrote,5950 he declared Him
to be God in Christ with whom all things agree which are predicted.5951 Now, to what god
will most suitably belong all those things which relate to “that good pleasure, which God
hath purposed in the mystery of His will, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times He
might recapitulate” (if I may so say, according to the exact meaning of the Greek word5952)
“all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth,”5953 but to Him
whose are all things from their beginning, yea the beginning itself too; from whom issue
the times and the dispensation of the fulness of times, according to which all things up to
the very first are gathered up in Christ? What beginning, however, has the other god; that
is to say, how can anything proceed from him, who has no work to show? And if there be
no beginning, how can there be times? If no times, what fulness of times can there be? And
if no fulness, what dispensation? Indeed, what has he ever done on earth, that any long dispensation
of times to be fulfilled can be put to his account, for the accomplishment of all
things in Christ, even of things in heaven? Nor can we possibly suppose that any things
whatever have been at any time done in heaven by any other God than Him by whom, as
all men allow, all things have been done on earth. Now, if it is impossible for all these things
from the beginning to be reckoned to any other God than the Creator, who will believe that
an alien god has recapitulated them in an alien Christ, instead of their own proper Author

in His own Christ? If, again, they belong to the Creator, they must needs be separate from
the other god; and if separate, then opposed to him. But then how can opposites be gathered
together into him by whom they are in short destroyed? Again, what Christ do the following
words announce, when the apostle says: “That we should be to the praise of His glory, who
first trusted in Christ?”5954 Now who could have first trusted—i.e. previously trusted5955—in
God, before His advent, except the Jews to whom Christ was previously announced, from
the beginning? He who was thus foretold, was also foretrusted. Hence the apostle refers the
statement to himself, that is, to the Jews, in order that he may draw a distinction with respect
to the Gentiles, (when he goes on to say:) “In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the
word of truth, the gospel (of your salvation); in whom ye believed, and were sealed with His
Holy Spirit of promise.”5956 Of what promise? That which was made through Joel: “In the
last days will I pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh,”5957 that is, on all nations. Therefore
the Spirit and the Gospel will be found in the Christ, who was foretrusted, because foretold.
Again, “the Father of glory”5958 is He whose Christ, when ascending to heaven, is celebrated
as “the King of Glory” in the Psalm: “Who is this King of Glory? the Lord of Hosts, He is
the King of Glory.”5959 From Him also is besought “the spirit of wisdom,”5960 at whose
disposal is enumerated that sevenfold distribution of the spirit of grace by Isaiah.5961 He
likewise will grant “the enlightenment of the eyes of the understanding,”5962 who has also
enriched our natural eyes with light; to whom, moreover, the blindness of the people is offensive:
“And who is blind, but my servants?…yea, the servants of God have become
blind.”5963 In His gift, too, are “the riches (of the glory) of His inheritance in the saints,”5964
who promised such an inheritance in the call of the Gentiles: “Ask of me, and I will give
Thee the heathen for Thine inheritance.”5965 It was He who “wrought in Christ His mighty
power, by raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His own right hand, and putting
all things under His feet”5966—even the same who said: “Sit Thou on my right hand, until

I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.”5967 For in another passage the Spirit says to the
Father concerning the Son: “Thou hast put all things under His feet.”5968 Now, if from all
these facts which are found in the Creator there is yet to be deduced5969 another god and
another Christ, let us go in quest of the Creator. I suppose, forsooth,5970 we find Him, when
he speaks of such as “were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein they had walked according
to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, who worketh in
the children of disobedience.”5971 But Marcion must not here interpret the world as
meaning the God of the world.5972 For a creature bears no resemblance to the Creator; the
thing made, none to its Maker; the world, none to God. He, moreover, who is the Prince of
the power of the ages must not be thought to be called the prince of the power of the air;
for He who is chief over the higher powers derives no title from the lower powers, although
these, too, may be ascribed to Him. Nor, again, can He possibly seem to be the instigator5973
of that unbelief which He Himself had rather to endure at the hand of the Jews and the
Gentiles alike. We may therefore simply conclude that5974 these designations are unsuited
to the Creator. There is another being to whom they are more applicable—and the apostle
knew very well who that was. Who then is he? Undoubtedly he who has raised up “children
of disobedience” against the Creator Himself ever since he took possession of that “air” of
His; even as the prophet makes him say: “I will set my throne above the stars;…I will go up
above the clouds; I will be like the Most High.”5975 This must mean the devil, whom in another
passage (since such will they there have the apostle’s meaning to be) we shall recognize
in the appellation the god of this world.5976 For he has filled the whole world with the lying
pretence of his own divinity. To be sure,5977 if he had not existed, we might then possibly
have applied these descriptions to the Creator. But the apostle, too, had lived in Judaism;
and when he parenthetically observed of the sins (of that period of his life), “in which also
we all had our conversation in times past,”5978 he must not be understood to indicate that

the Creator was the lord of sinful men, and the prince of this air; but as meaning that in his
Judaism he had been one of the children of disobedience, having the devil as his instigator—
when he persecuted the church and the Christ of the Creator. Therefore he says: “We
also were the children of wrath,” but “by nature.”5979 Let the heretic, however, not contend
that, because the Creator called the Jews children, therefore the Creator is the lord of
wrath.5980 For when (the apostle) says, “We were by nature the children of wrath,” inasmuch
as the Jews were not the Creator’s children by nature, but by the election of their fathers, he
(must have) referred their being children of wrath to nature, and not to the Creator, adding
this at last, “even as others,”5981 who, of course, were not children of God. It is manifest
that sins, and lusts of the flesh, and unbelief, and anger, are ascribed to the common nature
of all mankind, the devil however leading that nature astray,5982 which he has already infected
with the implanted germ of sin. “We,” says he, “are His workmanship, created in Christ.”5983
It is one thing to make (as a workman), another thing to create. But he assigns both to One.
Man is the workmanship of the Creator. He therefore who made man (at first), created him
also in Christ. As touching the substance of nature, He “made” him; as touching the work
of grace, He “created” him. Look also at what follows in connection with these words:
“Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision
by that which has the name of circumcision in the flesh made by the hand—that
at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and
strangers from the covenants of promise,5984 having no hope, and without God in the
world.”5985 Now, without what God and without what Christ were these Gentiles? Surely,
without Him to whom the commonwealth5986 of Israel belonged, and the covenants and
the promise. “But now in Christ,” says he, “ye who were sometimes far off are made nigh
by His blood.”5987 From whom were they far off before? From the (privileges) whereof he
speaks above, even from the Christ of the Creator, from the commonwealth of Israel, from
the covenants, from the hope of the promise, from God Himself. Since this is the case, the
Gentiles are consequently now in Christ made nigh to these (blessings), from which they
were once far off. But if we are in Christ brought so very nigh to the commonwealth of Israel,

which comprises the religion of the divine Creator, and to the covenants and to the promise,
yea to their very God Himself, it is quite ridiculous (to suppose that) the Christ of the other
god has brought us to this proximity to the Creator from afar. The apostle had in mind that
it had been predicted concerning the call of the Gentiles from their distant alienation in
words like these: “They who were far off from me have come to my righteousness.”5988 For
the Creator’s righteousness no less than His peace was announced in Christ, as we have often
shown already. Therefore he says: “He is our peace, who hath made both one”5989—that is,
the Jewish nation and the Gentile world. What is near, and what was far off now that “the
middle wall has been broken down” of their “enmity,” (are made one) “in His flesh.”5990
But Marcion erased the pronoun His, that he might make the enmity refer to flesh, as if (the
apostle spoke) of a carnal enmity, instead of the enmity which was a rival to Christ.5991 And
thus you have (as I have said elsewhere) exhibited the stupidity of Pontus, rather than the
adroitness of a Marrucinian,5992 for you here deny him flesh to whom in the verse above
you allowed blood! Since, however, He has made the law obsolete5993 by His own precepts,
even by Himself fulfilling the law (for superfluous is, “Thou shalt not commit adultery,”
when He says, “Thou shalt not look on a woman to lust after her;” superfluous also is, “Thou
shalt do no murder,” when He says, “Thou shalt not speak evil of thy neighbour,”) it is impossible
to make an adversary of the law out of one who so completely promotes it.5994 “For
to create5995 in Himself of twain,” for He who had made is also the same who creates (just
as we have found it stated above: “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus”),5996
“one new man, making peace” (really new, and really man—no phantom—but new, and
newly born of a virgin by the Spirit of God), “that He might reconcile both unto God”5997
(even the God whom both races had offended—both Jew and Gentile), “in one body,” says
he, “having in it slain the enmity by the cross.”5998 Thus we find from this passage also, that
there was in Christ a fleshly body, such as was able to endure the cross. “When, therefore,
He came and preached peace to them that were near and to them which were afar off,” we

apostles”5999—(the apostle added), “and the prophets;” these words, however, the heretic
erased, forgetting that the Lord had set in His Church not only apostles, but prophets also.
He feared, no doubt, that our building was to stand in Christ upon the foundation of the
ancient prophets,6000 since the apostle himself never fails to build us up everywhere with

<p>As our heretic is so fond of his pruning-knife, I do not wonder when syllables are expunged
by his hand, seeing that entire pages are usually the matter on which he practises
his effacing process. The apostle declares that to himself, “less than the least of all saints,
was the grace given” of enlightening all men as to “what was the fellowship of the mystery,
which during the ages had been hid in God, who created all things.”6003 The heretic erased
the preposition in, and made the clause run thus: (“what is the fellowship of the mystery)
which hath for ages been hidden from the God who created all things.”6004 The falsification,
however, is flagrantly6005 absurd. For the apostle goes on to infer (from his own statement):
“in order that unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might become known
through the church the manifold wisdom of God.”6006 Whose principalities and powers
does he mean? If the Creator’s, how does it come to pass that such a God as He could have
meant His wisdom to be displayed to the principalities and powers, but not to Himself? For
surely no principalities could possibly have understood anything without their sovereign
Lord. Or if (the apostle) did not mention God in this passage, on the ground that He (as
their chief) is Himself reckoned among these (principalities), then he would have plainly
said that the mystery had been hidden from the principalities and powers of Him who had
created all things, including Him amongst them. But if he states that it was hidden from
them, he must needs be understood6007 as having meant that it was manifest to Him. From
God, therefore, the mystery was not hidden; but it was hidden in God, the Creator of all
things, from His principalities and powers. For “who hath known the mind of the Lord, or
who hath been His counsellor?”6008 Caught in this trap, the heretic probably changed the

condidit.” The original is, Τίς ἡ οἰκονομία τοῦ μυστηρίου τοῦ ἀποκεκρυμμένου ἀπὸ τῶν αἰώνων ἐν τῷ Θεῷ
(compare Col. iii. 3) τῷ τὰ πάντα κτίσαντι. Marcion’s removal of the ἐν has no warrant of ms. authority; it upsets
St. Paul’s doctrine, as attested in other passages, and destroys the grammatical structure.</note>

passage, with the view of saying that his god wished to make known to his principalities and
powers the fellowship of his own mystery, of which God, who created all things, had been
ignorant. But what was the use of his obtruding this ignorance of the Creator, who was a
stranger to the superior god,6009 and far enough removed from him, when even his own
servants had known nothing about him? To the Creator, however, the future was well known.
Then why was not that also known to Him, which had to be revealed beneath His heaven,
and on His earth? From this, therefore, there arises a confirmation of what we have already
laid down. For since the Creator was sure to know, some time or other, that hidden mystery
of the superior god, even on the supposition that the true reading was (as Marcion has
it)—“hidden from the God who created all things”—he ought then to have expressed the
conclusion thus: “in order that the manifold wisdom of God might be made known to Him,
and then to the principalities and powers of God, whosoever He might be, with whom the
Creator was destined to share their knowledge.” So palpable is the erasure in this passage,
when thus read, consistently with its own true bearing. I, on my part, now wish to engage
with you in a discussion on the allegorical expressions of the apostle. What figures of speech
could the novel god have found in the prophets (fit for himself)? “He led captivity captive,”
says the apostle.6010 With what arms? In what conflicts? From the devastation of what
country? From the overthrow of what city? What women, what children, what princes did
the Conqueror throw into chains? For when by David Christ is sung as “girded with His
sword upon His thigh,”6011 or by Isaiah as “taking away the spoils of Samaria and the power
of Damascus,”6012 you make Him out to be6013 really and truly a warrior confest to the
eye.6014 Learn then now, that His is a spiritual armour and warfare, since you have already
discovered that the captivity is spiritual, in order that you may further learn that this also
belongs to Him, even because the apostle derived the mention of the captivity from the same
prophets as suggested to him his precepts likewise: “Putting away lying,” (says he,) “speak
every man truth with his neighbour;”6015 and again, using the very words in which the
Psalm6016 expresses his meaning, (he says,) “Be ye angry, and sin not;”6017 “Let not the sun
go down upon your wrath.”6018 “Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of dark-

ness;”6019 for (in the Psalm it is written,) “With the holy man thou shalt be holy, and with
the perverse thou shalt be perverse;”6020 and, “Thou shalt put away evil from among you.”6021
Again, “Go ye out from the midst of them; touch not the unclean thing; separate yourselves,
ye that bear the vessels of the Lord.”6022 (The apostle says further:) “Be not drunk with wine,
wherein is excess,”6023—a precept which is suggested by the passage (of the prophet), where
the seducers of the consecrated (Nazarites) to drunkenness are rebuked: “Ye gave wine to
my holy ones to drink.”6024 This prohibition from drink was given also to the high priest
Aaron and his sons, “when they went into the holy place.”6025 The command, to “sing to
the Lord with psalms and hymns,”6026 comes suitably from him who knew that those who
“drank wine with drums and psalteries” were blamed by God.6027 Now, when I find to what
God belong these precepts, whether in their germ or their development, I have no difficulty
in knowing to whom the apostle also belongs. But he declares that “wives ought to be in
subjection to their husbands:”6028 what reason does he give for this? “Because,” says he,
“the husband is the head of the wife.”6029 Pray tell me, Marcion, does your god build up the
authority of his law on the work of the Creator? This, however, is a comparative trifle; for
he actually derives from the same source the condition of his Christ and his Church; for he
says: “even as Christ is the head of the Church;”6030 and again, in like manner: “He who
loveth his wife, loveth his own flesh, even as Christ loved the Church.”6031 You see how
your Christ and your Church are put in comparison with the work of the Creator. How
much honour is given to the flesh in the name of the church! “No man,” says the apostle,
“ever yet hated his own flesh” (except, of course, Marcion alone), “but nourisheth and
cherisheth it, even as the Lord doth the Church.”6032 But you are the only man that hates
his flesh, for you rob it of its resurrection. It will be only right that you should hate the

Church also, because it is loved by Christ on the same principle.6033 Yea, Christ loved the
flesh even as the Church. For no man will love the picture of his wife without taking care
of it, and honouring it and crowning it. The likeness partakes with the reality in the privileged
honour. I shall now endeavour, from my point of view,6034 to prove that the same God is
(the God) of the man6035 and of Christ, of the woman and of the Church, of the flesh and
the spirit, by the apostle’s help who applies the Creator’s injunction, and adds even a comment
on it: “For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, (and shall be joined
unto his wife), and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery.”6036 In passing,6037
(I would say that) it is enough for me that the works of the Creator are great mysteries6038
in the estimation of the apostle, although they are so vilely esteemed by the heretics. “But I
am speaking,” says he, “of Christ and the Church.”6039 This he says in explanation of the
mystery, not for its disruption. He shows us that the mystery was prefigured by Him who
is also the author of the mystery. Now what is Marcion’s opinion? The Creator could not
possibly have furnished figures to an unknown god, or, if a known one, an adversary to
Himself. The superior god, in fact, ought to have borrowed nothing from the inferior; he
was bound rather to annihilate Him. “Children should obey their parents.”6040 Now, although
Marcion has erased (the next clause), “which is the first commandment with promise,”6041
still the law says plainly, “Honour thy father and thy mother.”6042 Again, (the apostle writes:)
“Parents, bring up your children in the fear and admonition of the Lord.”6043 For you have
heard how it was said to them of old time: “Ye shall relate these things to your children; and
your children in like manner to their children.”6044 Of what use are two gods to me, when
the discipline is but one? If there must be two, I mean to follow Him who was the first to
teach the lesson. But as our struggle lies against “the rulers of this world,”6045 what a host

of Creator Gods there must be!6046 For why should I not insist upon this point here, that
he ought to have mentioned but one “ruler of this world,” if he meant only the Creator to
be the being to whom belonged all the powers which he previously mentioned? Again, when
in the preceding verse he bids us “put on the whole armour of God, that we may be able to
stand against the wiles of the devil,”6047 does he not show that all the things which he
mentions after the devil’s name really belong to the devil—“the principalities and the powers,
and the rulers of the darkness of this world,”6048 which we also ascribe to the devil’s authority?
Else, if “the devil” means the Creator, who will be the devil in the Creator’s dispensation?
6049 As there are two gods, must there also be two devils, and a plurality of powers and
rulers of this world? But how is the Creator both a devil and a god at the same time, when
the devil is not at once both god and devil? For either they are both of them gods, if both of
them are devils; or else He who is God is not also devil, as neither is he god who is the devil.
I want to know indeed by what perversion6050 the word devil is at all applicable to the Creator.
Perhaps he perverted some purpose of the superior god—conduct such as He experienced
Himself from the archangel, who lied indeed for the purpose. For He did not forbid
(our first parents) a taste of the miserable tree,6051 from any apprehension that they would
become gods; His prohibition was meant to prevent their dying after the transgression. But
“the spiritual wickedness”6052 did not signify the Creator, because of the apostle’s additional
description, “in heavenly places;”6053 for the apostle was quite aware that “spiritual
wickedness” had been at work in heavenly places, when angels were entrapped into sin by
the daughters of men.6054 But how happened it that (the apostle) resorted to ambiguous
descriptions, and I know not what obscure enigmas, for the purpose of disparaging6055 the
Creator, when he displayed to the Church such constancy and plainness of speech in
“making known the mystery of the gospel for which he was an ambassador in bonds,” owing

of Our Christ in the Creator’s Ancient Dispensations. What is Included in
the Fulness of Christ. The Epicurean Character of Marcion’s God. The Catholic
Truth in Opposition Thereto. The Law is to Christ What the Shadow is to the

<p>I am accustomed in my prescription against all heresies, to fix my compendious criterion6057
(of truth) in the testimony of time; claiming priority therein as our rule, and alleging
lateness to be the characteristic of every heresy. This shall now be proved even by the
apostle, when he says: “For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard
before in the word of the truth of the gospel; which is come unto you, as it is unto all the
world.”6058 For if, even at that time, the tradition of the gospel had spread everywhere, how
much more now! Now, if it is our gospel which has spread everywhere, rather than any
heretical gospel, much less Marcion’s, which only dates from the reign of Antoninus,6059
then ours will be the gospel of the apostles. But should Marcion’s gospel succeed in filling
the whole world, it would not even in that case be entitled to the character of apostolic. For
this quality, it will be evident, can only belong to that gospel which was the first to fill the
world; in other words, to the gospel of that God who of old declared this of its promulgation:
“Their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.”6060
He calls Christ “the image of the invisible God.”6061 We in like manner say that the Father
of Christ is invisible, for we know that it was the Son who was seen in ancient times
(whenever any appearance was vouchsafed to men in the name of God) as the image of (the
Father) Himself. He must not be regarded, however, as making any difference between a
visible and an invisible God; because long before he wrote this we find a description of our
God to this effect: “No man can see the Lord, and live.”6062 If Christ is not “the first-begotten
before every creature,”6063 as that “Word of God by whom all things were made, and without
whom nothing was made;”6064 if “all things were” not “in Him created, whether in heaven

or on earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities,
or powers;” if “all things were” not “created by Him and for Him” (for these truths Marcion
ought not to allow concerning Him), then the apostle could not have so positively laid it
down, that “He is before all.”6065 For how is He before all, if He is not before all things?6066
How, again, is He before all things, if He is not “the first-born of every creature”—if He is
not the Word of the Creator?6067 Now how will he be proved to have been before all things,
who appeared after all things? Who can tell whether he had a prior existence, when he has
found no proof that he had any existence at all? In what way also could it have “pleased
(the Father) that in Him should all fulness dwell?”6068 For, to begin with, what fulness is
that which is not comprised of the constituents which Marcion has removed from it,—even
those that were “created in Christ, whether in heaven or on earth,” whether angels or men?
which is not made of the things that are visible and invisible? which consists not of thrones
and dominions and principalities and powers? If, on the other hand,6069 our false apostles
and Judaizing gospellers6070 have introduced all these things out of their own stores, and
Marcion has applied them to constitute the fulness of his own god, (this hypothesis, absurd
though it be, alone would justify him;) for how, on any other supposition,6071 could the
rival and the destroyer of the Creator have been willing that His fulness should dwell in his
Christ? To whom, again, does He “reconcile all things by Himself, making peace by the
blood of His cross,”6072 but to Him whom those very things had altogether6073 offended,
against whom they had rebelled by transgression, (but) to whom they had at last returned?6074
Conciliated they might have been to a strange god; but reconciled they could not possibly
have been to any other than their own God. Accordingly, ourselves “who were sometime
alienated and enemies in our mind by wicked works”6075 does He reconcile to the Creator,
against whom we had committed offence—worshipping the creature to the prejudice of the
Creator. As, however, he says elsewhere,6076 that the Church is the body of Christ, so here

also (the apostle) declares that he “fills up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ
in his flesh for His body’s sake, which is the Church.”6077 But you must not on this account
suppose that on every mention of His body the term is only a metaphor, instead of meaning
real flesh. For he says above that we are “reconciled in His body through death;”6078 meaning,
of course, that He died in that body wherein death was possible through the flesh: (therefore
he adds,) not through the Church6079 (per ecclesiam), but expressly for the sake of the Church
(proper ecclesiam), exchanging body for body—one of flesh for a spiritual one. When, again,
he warns them to “beware of subtle words and philosophy,” as being “a vain deceit,” such
as is “after the rudiments of the world” (not understanding thereby the mundane fabric of
sky and earth, but worldly learning, and “the tradition of men,” subtle in their speech and
their philosophy),6080 it would be tedious, and the proper subject of a separate work, to
show how in this sentence (of the apostle’s) all heresies are condemned, on the ground of
their consisting of the resources of subtle speech and the rules of philosophy. But (once for
all) let Marcion know that the principle term of his creed comes from the school of Epicurus,
implying that the Lord is stupid and indifferent;6081 wherefore he refuses to say that He is
an object to be feared. Moreover, from the porch of the Stoics he brings out matter, and
places it on a par with the Divine Creator.6082 He also denies the resurrection of the flesh,—a
truth which none of the schools of philosophy agreed together to hold.6083 But how remote
is our (Catholic) verity from the artifices of this heretic, when it dreads to arouse the anger
of God, and firmly believes that He produced all things out of nothing, and promises to us
a restoration from the grave of the same flesh (that died) and holds without a blush that
Christ was born of the virgin’s womb! At this, philosophers, and heretics, and the very
heathen, laugh and jeer. For “God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound
the wise”6084—that God, no doubt, who in reference to this very dispensation of His

The otiose and inert character of the god of Epicurus is referred to by Tertullian not unfrequently; see above, in
book iv. chap. xv.; Apolog. 47, and Ad Nationes, ii. 2; whilst in De Anima, 3, he characterizes the philosophy of

threatened long before that He would “destroy the wisdom of the wise.”6085 Thanks to this
simplicity of truth, so opposed to the subtlety and vain deceit of philosophy, we cannot
possibly have any relish for such perverse opinions. Then, if God “quickens us together
with Christ, forgiving us our trespasses,”6086 we cannot suppose that sins are forgiven by
Him against whom, as having been all along unknown, they could not have been committed.
Now tell me, Marcion, what is your opinion of the apostle’s language, when he says, “Let
no man judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or
of the sabbath, which is a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ?”6087 We do
not now treat of the law, further than (to remark) that the apostle here teaches clearly how
it has been abolished, even by passing from shadow to substance—that is, from figurative
types to the reality, which is Christ. The shadow, therefore, is His to whom belongs the body
also; in other words, the law is His, and so is Christ. If you separate the law and Christ, as-
signing one to one god and the other to another, it is the same as if you were to attempt to
separate the shadow from the body of which it is the shadow. Manifestly Christ has relation
to the law, if the body has to its shadow. But when he blames those who alleged visions of
angels as their authority for saying that men must abstain from meats—“you must not touch,
you must not taste”—in a voluntary humility, (at the same time) “vainly puffed up in the
fleshly mind, and not holding the Head,”6088 (the apostle) does not in these terms attack
the law or Moses, as if it was at the suggestion of superstitious angels that he had enacted
his prohibition of sundry aliments. For Moses had evidently received the law from God.
When, therefore, he speaks of their “following the commandments and doctrines of men,”6089
he refers to the conduct of those persons who “held not the Head,” even Him in whom all
things are gathered together;6090 for they are all recalled to Christ, and concentrated in Him
as their initiating principle6091—even the meats and drinks which were indifferent in their
nature. All the rest of his precepts,6092 as we have shown sufficiently, when treating of them
as they occurred in another epistle,6093 emanated from the Creator, who, while predicting
that “old things were to pass away,” and that He would “make all things new,”6094 com-

Phrases—Form of a Servant, Likeness, and Fashion of a Man—No Sanction of
Docetism. No Antithesis (Such as Marcion Alleged) in the God of Judaism and
the God of the Gospel Deducible from Certain Contrasts Mentioned in This
Epistle. A Parallel with a Passage in Genesis. The Resurrection of the Body, and
the Change Thereof.</head>
<p>When (the apostle) mentions the several motives of those who were preaching the gospel,
how that some, “waxing confident by his bonds, were more fearless in speaking the word,”
while others “preached Christ even out of envy and strife, and again others out of goodwill,”
many also “out of love,” and certain “out of contention,” and some “in rivalry to
himself,”6096 he had a favourable opportunity, no doubt,6097 of taxing what they preached
with a diversity of doctrine, as if it were no less than this which caused so great a variance
in their tempers. But while he exposes these tempers as the sole cause of the diversity, he
avoids inculpating the regular mysteries of the faith,6098 and affirms that there is, notwithstanding,
but one Christ and His one God, whatever motives men had in preaching Him.
Therefore, says he, it matters not to me “whether it be in pretence or in truth that Christ is
preached,”6099 because one Christ alone was announced, whether in their “pretentious” or
their “truthful” faith. For it was to the faithfulness of their preaching that he applied the
word truth, not to the rightness of the rule itself, because there was indeed but one rule;
whereas the conduct of the preachers varied: in some of them it was true, i.e. single-minded,
while in others it was sophisticated with over-much learning. This being the case, it is
manifest that that Christ was the subject of their preaching who was always the theme of
the prophets. Now, if it were a completely different Christ that was being introduced by the
apostle, the novelty of the thing would have produced a diversity (in belief.). For there would
not have been wanting, in spite of the novel teaching,6100 men to interpret the preached
gospel of the Creator’s Christ, since the majority of persons everywhere now-a-days are of
our way of thinking, rather than on the heretical side. So that the apostle would not in such
a passage as the present one have refrained from remarking and censuring the diversity.
Since, however, there is no blame of a diversity, there is no proof of a novelty. Of course6101

the Marcionites suppose that they have the apostle on their side in the following passage in
the matter of Christ’s substance—that in Him there was nothing but a phantom of flesh.
For he says of Christ, that, “being in the form of God, He thought it not robbery to be equal
with God;6102 but emptied6103 Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant,” not the
reality, “and was made in the likeness of man,” not a man, “and was found in fashion as a
man,”6104 not in his substance, that is to say, his flesh; just as if to a substance there did not
accrue both form and likeness and fashion. It is well for us that in another passage (the
apostle) calls Christ “the image of the invisible God.”6105 For will it not follow with equal
force from that passage, that Christ is not truly God, because the apostle places Him in the
image of God, if, (as Marcion contends,) He is not truly man because of His having taken
on Him the form or image of a man? For in both cases the true substance will have to be
excluded, if image (or “fashion”) and likeness and form shall be claimed for a phantom. But
since he is truly God, as the Son of the Father, in His fashion and image, He has been already
by the force of this conclusion determined to be truly man, as the Son of man, “found in
the fashion” and image “of a man.” For when he propounded6106 Him as thus “found” in
the manner6107 of a man, he in fact affirmed Him to be most certainly human. For what is
found, manifestly possesses existence. Therefore, as He was found to be God by His mighty
power, so was He found to be man by reason of His flesh, because the apostle could not
have pronounced Him to have “become obedient unto death,”6108 if He had not been constituted
of a mortal substance. Still more plainly does this appear from the apostle’s additional
words, “even the death of the cross.”6109 For he could hardly mean this to be a climax6110
to the human suffering, to extol the virtue6111 of His obedience, if he had known it all to be
the imaginary process of a phantom, which rather eluded the cross than experienced it, and
which displayed no virtue6112 in the suffering, but only illusion. But “those things which
he had once accounted gain,” and which he enumerates in the preceding verse—“trust in
the flesh,” the sign of “circumcision,” his origin as “an Hebrew of the Hebrews,” his descent

from “the tribe of Benjamin,” his dignity in the honours of the Pharisee6113—he now reckons
to be only “loss” to himself;6114 (in other words,) it was not the God of the Jews, but their
stupid obduracy, which he repudiates. These are also the things “which he counts but dung
for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ”6115 (but by no means for the rejection of God
the Creator); “whilst he has not his own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which
is through Him,” i.e. Christ, “the righteousness which is of God.”6116 Then, say you, according
to this distinction the law did not proceed from the God of Christ. Subtle enough! But here
is something still more subtle for you. For when (the apostle) says, “Not (the righteousness)
which is of the law, but that which is through Him,” he would not have used the phrase
through Him of any other than Him to whom the law belonged. “Our conversation,” says
he, “is in heaven.”6117 I here recognise the Creator’s ancient promise to Abraham: “I will
multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven.”6118 Therefore “one star differeth from another
star in glory.”6119 If, again, Christ in His advent from heaven “shall change the body of our
humiliation, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body,”6120 it follows that this
body of ours shall rise again, which is now in a state of humiliation in its sufferings and according
to the law of mortality drops into the ground. But how shall it be changed, if it shall
have no real existence? If, however, this is only said of those who shall be found in the
flesh6121 at the advent of God, and who shall have to be changed,”6122 what shall they do
who will rise first? They will have no substance from which to undergo a change. But he
says (elsewhere), “We shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord
(in the air).”6123 Then, if we are to be caught up alone with them, surely we shall likewise
be changed together with them.</p>

Inconsistency in Accepting This, and Rejecting Three Other Epistles Addressed

<p>To this epistle alone did its brevity avail to protect it against the falsifying hands of
Marcion. I wonder, however, when he received (into his Apostolicon) this letter which was
written but to one man, that he rejected the two epistles to Timothy and the one to Titus,
which all treat of ecclesiastical discipline. His aim, was, I suppose, to carry out his interpol-

 <p>I.
(Soul and Spirit, cap. xv. and notes 1 and 2, p. 463.)</p>
<p>Dr. Holmes, in the learned note which follows, affords me a valuable addition to my
scanty remarks on this subject in former volumes. See (Vol. I. pp. 387, 532,) references to
the great work of Professor Delitzsch, in notes on Irenæus. In Vol. II. p. 102, I have also
mentioned M. Heard’s work, on the Tripartite Nature of Man. With reference to the disagreement
of the learned on this great matter, let me ask is it not less real than apparent?
The dichotomy to which Tertullian objected, and the trichotomy which Dr. Holmes makes
a name of “the triple nature,” are terms which rather suggest a process of “dividing asunder
of soul and spirit,” and which involve an ambiguity that confuses the inquiry. Now, while
the gravest objections may be imagined, or even demonstrated, against a process which
seems to destroy the unity and individuality of a Man, does not every theologian accept the
analytical formula of the apostle and recognize the bodily, the animal and the spiritual in
the life of man? If so is there not fundamental agreement as to 1 Thess. v. 23, and difference
only, relatively, as to functions and processes, or as to the way in which truth on these three
points ought to be stated? On this subject there are good remarks in the Speaker’s Commentary
on the text aforesaid, but the exhaustive work of Delitzsch deserves study.</p>
<p>Man’s whole nature in Christ, seems to be sanctified by the Holy Spirit’s suffusion of
man’s spirit; this rules and governs the psychic nature and through it the body.</p>

 <p>II.
(The entire work, cap. xxi. p. 474.)</p>
<p>He who has followed Tertullian through the mazes in which Marcion, in spite of shifts
and turnings innumerable, has been hunted down, and defeated, must recognize the great
work performed by this author in behalf of Christian Orthodoxy. It seems to have been the
plan of Christ’s watchful care over His Church, that, in the earliest stages of its existence
the enemy should be allowed to display his utmost malice and to bring out all his forces
against Truth. Thus, before the meeting of Church-councils the language of faith had grown
up, and clear views and precise statements of doctrine had been committed to the idioms
of human thought. But, the labours of Tertullian are not confined to these diverse purposes.
With all the faults of his acute and forensic mind, how powerfully he illuminates the Scriptures
and glorifies them as containing the whole system of the Faith. How rich are his

<pb n="1037"/>
quotations, and how penetrating his conceptions of their uses. Besides all this, what an in-
troduction he gives us to the modes of thought which were becoming familiar in the West,
and which were convening the Latin tongue to new uses, and making it capable of expressing
Augustine’s mind and so of creating new domains of Learning among the nations of Europe.</p>
<p>If I have treated tenderly the reputation of this great Master, in my notes upon his
Marcion, it is with a twofold purpose. (1.) It seems to me due to truth that his name should
be less associated with his deplorable lapse than with his long and faithful services to the
Church, and (2.) that the student should thus follow his career with a pleasure and with a
confidence the lack of which perpetually annoys us when we give the first place to the
Montanist and not to the Catholic. Let this be our spirit in accompanying him into his fresh
campaigns against “the grievous wolves” foreseen by St. Paul with tears. Acts xx. 29, 30.</p>
<p>But as our Author invokes a careful examination of his “entire work,” let the student
recur to Irenæus (Vol. I. p. 352, etc.) and observe how formidable, from the beginning, was
the irreligion of Marcion. His doctrines did truly “eat like a canker,” assailing the Scriptures
by mutilations and corruptions of the text itself. No marvel that Tertullian shows him no
quarter, though we must often regret the forensic violence of his retort. As to the Dualism
which, through Marcion, thus threatened the first article of the Creed, consult the valuable
remarks of the Encyc. Britannica, (“Mithras”). Mithras became known to the Romans circa
b.c. 70, and his worship flourished under Trajan and his successors. An able writer remarks
that it was natural “Dualism should develop itself out of primitive Zoroastrianism. The
human mind has ever been struck with a certain antagonism of which it has sought to discover
the cause. Evil seems most easily accounted for by the supposition of an evil Person;
and the continuance of an equal struggle, without advantage to either side, seems to imply
the equality of that evil Person with the author of all good. Thus Dualism had its birth. Many
came to believe in the existence of two co-eternal and co-equal Persons, one good and the
other evil, between whom there has been from all eternity a perpetual conflict, and between
whom the same conflict must continue to rage through all coming time.”</p>

 Against Hermogenes.</head>
<p>Containing an Argument Against His Opinion that Matter is

<p>We are accustomed, for the purpose of shortening argument,6129 to lay down the rule
against heretics of the lateness of their date.6130 For in as far as by our rule, priority is given
to the truth, which also foretold that there would be heresies, in so far must all later opinions
be prejudged as heresies, being such as were, by the more ancient rule of truth, predicted
as (one day) to happen. Now, the doctrine of Hermogenes has this6131 taint of novelty. He
is, in short,6132 a man living in the world at the present time; by his very nature a heretic,
and turbulent withal, who mistakes loquacity for eloquence, and supposes impudence to be
firmness, and judges it to be the duty of a good conscience to speak ill of individuals.6133
Moreover, he despises God’s law in his painting,6134 maintaining repeated marriages,6135

He does not appear to acknowledge any other Christ as Lord,6141 though he holds Him in
a different way; but by this difference in his faith he really makes Him another being,—nay,
he takes from Him everything which is God, since he will not have it that He made all things
of nothing. For, turning away from Christians to the philosophers, from the Church to the
Academy and the Porch, he learned there from the Stoics how to place Matter (on the same
level) with the Lord, just as if it too had existed ever both unborn and unmade, having no
beginning at all nor end, out of which, according to him,6142 the Lord afterwards created
all things.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—Hermogenes, After a Perverse Induction from Mere Heretical Assumptions,
Concludes that God Created All Things Out of Pre-Existing Matter.</head>
<p>Our very bad painter has coloured this his primary shade absolutely without any light,
with such arguments as these: He begins with laying down the premiss,6143 that the Lord
made all things either out of Himself, or out of nothing, or out of something; in order that,
after he has shown that it was impossible for Him to have made them either out of Himself
or out of nothing, he might thence affirm the residuary proposition that He made them out
of something, and therefore that that something was Matter. He could not have made all
things, he says, of Himself; because whatever things the Lord made of Himself would have
been parts of Himself; but6144 He is not dissoluble into parts,6145 because, being the Lord,
He is indivisible, and unchangeable, and always the same. Besides, if He had made anything
out of Himself, it would have been something of Himself. Everything, however, both which
was made and which He made must be accounted imperfect, because it was made of a part,
and He made it of a part; or if, again, it was a whole which He made, who is a whole Himself,
He must in that case have been at once both a whole, and yet not a whole; because it behoved
Him to be a whole, that He might produce Himself,6146 and yet not a whole, that He might
be produced out of Himself.6147 But this is a most difficult position. For if He were in existence,
He could not be made, for He was in existence already; if, however, he were not in
existence He could not make, because He was a nonentity. He maintains, moreover, that
He who always exists, does not come into existence,6148 but exists for ever and ever. He accordingly
concludes that He made nothing out of Himself, since He never passed into such
a condition6149 as made it possible for Him to make anything out of Himself. In like manner,
he contends that He could not have made all things out of nothing—thus: He defines the
Lord as a being who is good, nay, very good, who must will to make things as good and excellent
as He is Himself; indeed it were impossible for Him either to will or to make anything
which was not good, nay, very good itself. Therefore all things ought to have been made
good and excellent by Him, after His own condition. Experience shows,6150 however, that
things which are even evil were made by Him: not, of course, of His own will and pleasure;

because, if it had been of His own will and pleasure, He would be sure to have made nothing
unfitting or unworthy of Himself. That, therefore, which He made not of His own will must
be understood to have been made from the fault of something, and that is from Matter,
without a doubt.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—An Argument of Hermogenes. The Answer: While God is a Title
Eternally Applicable to the Divine Being, Lord and Father are Only Relative
Appellations, Not Eternally Applicable. An Inconsistency in the Argument of
Hermogenes Pointed Out.</head>
<p>He adds also another point: that as God was always God, there was never a time when
God was not also Lord. But6151 it was in no way possible for Him to be regarded as always
Lord, in the same manner as He had been always God, if there had not been always, in the
previous eternity,6152 a something of which He could be regarded as evermore the Lord. So
he concludes6153 that God always had Matter co-existent with Himself as the Lord thereof.
Now, this tissue6154 of his I shall at once hasten to pull abroad. I have been willing to set it
out in form to this length, for the information of those who are unacquainted with the
subject, that they may know that his other arguments likewise need only be6155 understood
to be refuted. We affirm, then, that the name of God always existed with Himself and in
Himself—but not eternally so the Lord. Because the condition of the one is not the same
as that of the other. God is the designation of the substance itself, that is, of the Divinity;
but Lord is (the name) not of substance, but of power. I maintain that the substance existed
always with its own name, which is God; the title Lord was afterwards added, as the indication
indeed6156 of something accruing. For from the moment when those things began to exist,
over which the power of a Lord was to act, God, by the accession of that power, both became
Lord and received the name thereof. Because God is in like manner a Father, and He is also
a Judge; but He has not always been Father and Judge, merely on the ground of His having
always been God. For He could not have been the Father previous to the Son, nor a Judge
previous to sin. There was, however, a time when neither sin existed with Him, nor the Son;
the former of which was to constitute the Lord a Judge, and the latter a Father. In this way
He was not Lord previous to those things of which He was to be the Lord. But He was only
to become Lord at some future time: just as He became the Father by the Son, and a Judge
by sin, so also did He become Lord by means of those things which He had made, in order
that they might serve Him. Do I seem to you to be weaving arguments,6157 Hermogenes?
How neatly does Scripture lend us its aid,6158 when it applies the two titles to Him with a

<note type="footnote">6158 Naviter nobis patrocinatur.</note>

<pb n="1043"/>
distinction, and reveals them each at its proper time! For (the title) God, indeed, which always
belonged to Him, it names at the very first: “In the beginning God created the heaven and
the earth;”6159 and as long as He continued making, one after the other, those things of
which He was to be the Lord, it merely mentions God. “And God said,” “and God made,”
“and God saw;”6160 but nowhere do we yet find the Lord. But when He completed the whole
creation, and especially man himself, who was destined to understand His sovereignty in a
way of special propriety, He then is designated6161 Lord. Then also the Scripture added the
name Lord: “And the Lord God, Deus Dominus, took the man, whom He had formed;”6162
“And the Lord God commanded Adam.”6163 Thenceforth He, who was previously God
only, is the Lord, from the time of His having something of which He might be the Lord.
For to Himself He was always God, but to all things was He only then God, when He became
also Lord. Therefore, in as far as (Hermogenes) shall suppose that Matter was eternal, on
the ground that the Lord was eternal, in so far will it be evident that nothing existed, because
it is plain that the Lord as such did not always exist. Now I mean also, on my own part,6164
to add a remark for the sake of ignorant persons, of whom Hermogenes is an extreme instance,
6165 and actually to retort against him his own arguments.6166 For when he denies
that Matter was born or made, I find that, even on these terms, the title Lord is unsuitable
to God in respect of Matter, because it must have been free,6167 when by not having a beginning
it had not an author. The fact of its past existence it owed to no one, so that it could
be a subject to no one. Therefore ever since God exercised His power over it, by creating
(all things) out of Matter, although it had all along experienced God as its Lord, yet Matter
does, after all, demonstrate that God did not exist in the relation of Lord to it,6168 although
all the while He was really so.6169</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Hermogenes Gives Divine Attributes to Matter, and So Makes Two
Gods.</head>
<p>At this point, then, I shall begin to treat of Matter, how that, (according to Hermogenes,)
6170 God compares it with Himself as equally unborn, equally unmade, equally
eternal, set forth as being without a beginning, without an end. For what other estimate6171
of God is there than eternity? What other condition has eternity than to have ever existed,
and to exist yet for evermore by virtue of its privilege of having neither beginning nor end?
Now, since this is the property of God, it will belong to God alone, whose property it is—of
course6172 on this ground, that if it can be ascribed to any other being, it will no longer be
the property of God, but will belong, along with Him, to that being also to which it is ascribed.
For “although there be that are called gods” in name, “whether in heaven or in earth, yet to
us there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things;”6173 whence the greater reason
why, in our view,6174 that which is the property6175 of God ought to be regarded as pertaining
to God alone, and why (as I have already said) that should cease to be such a property, when
it is shared by another being. Now, since He is God, it must necessarily be a unique mark
of this quality,6176 that it be confined to One. Else, what will be unique and singular, if that
is not which has nothing equal to it? What will be principal, if that is not which is above all
things, before all things, and from which all things proceed? By possessing these He is God
alone, and by His sole possession of them He is One. If another also shared in the possession,
there would then be as many gods as there were possessors of these attributes of God. Hermogenes,
therefore, introduces two gods: he introduces Matter as God’s equal. God, however,

<head>Chapter V.—Hermogenes Coquets with His Own Argument, as If Rather Afraid of
It. After Investing Matter with Divine Qualities, He Tries to Make It Somehow
Inferior to God.</head>
<p>But God is God, and Matter is Matter. As if a mere difference in their names prevented
equality,6178 when an identity of condition is claimed for them! Grant that their nature is
different; assume, too, that their form is not identical,—what matters it so long as their absolute
state have but one mode?6179 God is unborn; is not Matter also unborn? God ever
exists; is not Matter, too, ever existent? Both are without beginning; both are without end;
both are the authors of the universe—both He who created it, and the Matter of which He
made it. For it is impossible that Matter should not be regarded as the author6180 of all
things, when the universe is composed of it. What answer will he give? Will he say that
Matter is not then comparable with God as soon as6181 it has something belonging to God;
since, by not having total (divinity), it cannot correspond to the whole extent of the comparison?
But what more has he reserved for God, that he should not seem to have accorded to
Matter the full amount of the Deity?6182 He says in reply, that even though this is the
prerogative of Matter, both the authority and the substance of God must remain intact, by
virtue of which He is regarded as the sole and prime Author, as well as the Lord of all things.
Truth, however, maintains the unity of God in such a way as to insist that whatever belongs
to God Himself belongs to Him alone. For so will it belong to Himself if it belong to Him
alone; and therefore it will be impossible that another god should be admitted, when it is
permitted to no other being to possess anything of God. Well, then, you say, we ourselves
at that rate possess nothing of God. But indeed we do, and shall continue to do—only it is
from Him that we receive it, and not from ourselves. For we shall be even gods, if we, shall
deserve to be among those of whom He declared, “I have said, Ye are gods,”6183 and, “God
standeth in the congregation of the gods.”6184 But this comes of His own grace, not from
any property in us, because it is He alone who can make gods. The property of Matter,
however, he6185 makes to be that which it has in common with God. Otherwise, if it received
from God the property which belongs to God,—I mean its attribute6186 of eternity—one

at the same time is not God. But what inconsistency is it for him6187 to allow that there is

<head>Chapter VI.—The Shifts to Which Hermogenes is Reduced, Who Deifies Matter,
and Yet is Unwilling to Hold Him Equal with the Divine Creator.</head>
<p>He declares that God’s attribute is still safe to Him, of being the only God, and the First,
and the Author of all things, and the Lord of all things, and being incomparable to
any—qualities which he straightway ascribes to Matter also. He is God, to be sure. God shall
also attest the same; but He has also sworn sometimes by Himself, that there is no other
God like Him.6188 Hermogenes, however, will make Him a liar. For Matter will be such a
God as He—being unmade, unborn, without beginning, and without end. God will say, “I
am the first!”6189 Yet how is He the first, when Matter is co-eternal with Him? Between coeternals
and contemporaries there is no sequence of rank.6190 Is then, Matter also the first?
“I,” says the Lord, “have stretched out the heavens alone.”6191 But indeed He was not alone,
when that likewise stretched them out, of which He made the expanse. When he asserts the
position that Matter was eternal, without any encroachment on the condition of God, let
him see to it that we do not in ridicule turn the tables on him, that God similarly was
eternal without any encroachment on the condition of Matter—the condition of Both being
still common to Them. The position, therefore, remains unimpugned6192 both in the case
of Matter, that it did itself exist, only along with God; and that God existed alone, but with
Matter. It also was first with God, as God, too, was first with it; it, however, is not comparable
with God, as God, too, is not to be compared with it; with God also it was the Author (of
all things), and with God their Sovereign. In this way he proposes that God has something,
and yet not the whole, of Matter. For Him, accordingly, Hermogenes has reserved nothing
which he had not equally conferred on Matter, so that it is not Matter which is compared
with God, but rather God who is compared with Matter. Now, inasmuch as those qualities
which we claim as peculiar to God—to have always existed, without a beginning, without
an end, and to have been the First, and Alone, and the Author of all things—are also com-
patible to Matter, I want to know what property Matter possesses different and alien from
God, and hereby special to itself, by reason of which it is incapable of being compared with
God? That Being, in which occur6193 all the properties of God, is sufficiently predetermined
without any further comparison.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—Hermogenes Held to His Theory in Order that Its Absurdity May Be
Exposed on His Own Principles.</head>
<p>When he contends that matter is less than God, and inferior to Him, and therefore diverse
from Him, and for the same reason not a fit subject of comparison with Him, who is
a greater and superior Being, I meet him with this prescription, that what is eternal and
unborn is incapable of any diminution and inferiority, because it is simply this which makes
even God to be as great as He is, inferior and subject to none—nay, greater and higher than
all. For, just as all things which are born, or which come to an end, and are therefore not
eternal, do, by reason of their exposure at once to an end and a beginning, admit of qualities
which are repugnant to God—I mean diminution and inferiority, because they are born
and made—so likewise God, for this very reason, is unsusceptible of these accidents, because
He is absolutely unborn,6194 and also unmade. And yet such also is the condition of Matter.
6195 Therefore, of the two Beings which are eternal, as being unborn and unmade—God
and Matter—by reason of the identical mode of their common condition (both of them
equally possessing that which admits neither of diminution nor subjection—that is, the attribute
of eternity), we affirm that neither of them is less or greater than the other, neither
of them is inferior or superior to the other; but that they both stand on a par in greatness,
on a par in sublimity, and on the same level of that complete and perfect felicity of which
eternity is reckoned to consist. Now we must not resemble the heathen in our opinions;
for they, when constrained to acknowledge God, insist on having other deities below Him.
The Divinity, however, has no degrees, because it is unique; and if it shall be found in Matter—
as being equally unborn and unmade and eternal—it must be resident in both alike,6196
because in no case can it be inferior to itself. In what way, then, will Hermogenes have the
courage to draw distinctions; and thus to subject matter to God, an eternal to the Eternal,
an unborn to the Unborn, an author to the Author? seeing that it dares to say, I also am the
first; I too am before all things; and I am that from which all things proceed; equal we have
been, together we have been—both alike without beginning, without end; both alike without
an Author, without a God.6197 What God, then, is He who subjects me to a contemporaneous,
co-eternal power? If it be He who is called God, then I myself, too, have my own (divine)
name. Either I am God, or He is Matter, because we both are that which neither of us is. Do
you suppose, therefore, that he6198 has not made Matter equal with God, although, forsooth,
he pretends it to be inferior to Him?</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—On His Own Principles, Hermogenes Makes Matter, on the Whole,
Superior to God.</head>
<p>Nay more,6199 he even prefers Matter to God, and rather subjects God to it, when he
will have it that God made all things out of Matter. For if He drew His resources from it6200
for the creation of the world, Matter is already found to be the superior, inasmuch as it
furnished Him with the means of effecting His works; and God is thereby clearly subjected
to Matter, of which the substance was indispensable to Him. For there is no one but requires
that which he makes use of;6201 no one but is subject to the thing which he requires, for the
very purpose of being able to make use of it. So, again, there is no one who, from using what
belongs to another, is not inferior to him of whose property he makes use; and there is no
one who imparts6202 of his own for another’s use, who is not in this respect superior to him
to whose use he lends his property. On this principle,6203 Matter itself, no doubt,6204 was
not in want of God, but rather lent itself to God, who was in want of it—rich and abundant
and liberal as it was—to one who was, I suppose, too small, and too weak, and too unskilful,
to form what He willed out of nothing. A grand service, verily,6205 did it confer on God in
giving Him means at the present time whereby He might be known to be God, and be called
Almighty—only that He is no longer Almighty, since He is not powerful enough for this,
to produce all things out of nothing. To be sure,6206 Matter bestowed somewhat on itself
also—even to get its own self acknowledged with God as God’s co-equal, nay more, as His
helper; only there is this drawback, that Hermogenes is the only man that has found out
this fact, besides the philosophers—those patriarchs of all heresy.6207 For the prophets knew
nothing about it, nor the apostles thus far, nor, I suppose, even Christ.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—Sundry Inevitable But Intolerable Conclusions from the Principles of
Hermogenes.</head>
<p>He cannot say that it was as its Lord that God employed Matter for His creative works,
for He could not have been the Lord of a substance which was co-equal with Himself. Well,
but perhaps it was a title derived from the will of another,6208 which he enjoyed—a precarious
holding, and not a lordship,6209 and that to such a degree, that6210 although Matter was
evil, He yet endured to make use of an evil substance, owing, of course, to the restraint of
His own limited power,6211 which made Him impotent to create out of nothing, not in
consequence of His power; for if, as God, He had at all possessed power over Matter which
He knew to be evil, He would first have converted it into good—as its Lord and the good
God—that so He might have a good thing to make use of, instead of a bad one. But being
undoubtedly good, only not the Lord withal, He, by using such power6212 as He possessed,
showed the necessity He was under of yielding to the condition of Matter, which He would
have amended if He had been its Lord. Now this is the answer which must be given to
Hermogenes when he maintains that it was by virtue of His Lordship that God used Matter—
even of His non-possession of any right to it, on the ground, of course, of His not
having Himself made it. Evil then, on your terms,6213 must proceed from God Himself,
since He is—I will not say the Author of evil, because He did not form it, but—the permitter
thereof, as having dominion over it.6214 If indeed Matter shall prove not even to belong to
God at all, as being evil, it follows,6215 that when He made use of what belonged to another,
He used it either on a precarious title6216 because He was in need of it, or else by violent
possession because He was stronger than it. For by three methods is the property of others
obtained,—by right, by permission, by violence; in other words, by lordship, by a title derived
from the will of another,6217 by force. Now, as lordship is out of the question, Hermogenes
must choose which (of the other methods) is suitable to God. Did He, then, make all things
out of Matter, by permission, or by force? But, in truth, would not God have more wisely

<head>Chapter X.—To What Straits Hermogenes Absurdly Reduces the Divine Being. He
Does Nothing Short of Making Him the Author of Evil.</head>
<p>Even if Matter had been the perfection of good,6219 would it not have been equally indecorous
in Him to have thought of the property of another, however good, (to effect His
purpose by the help of it)? It was, therefore, absurd enough for Him, in the interest of His
own glory, to have created the world in such a way as to betray His own obligation to a
substance which belonged to another—and that even not good. Was He then, asks (Hermogenes),
to make all things out of nothing, that so evil things themselves might be attributed
to His will? Great, in all conscience,6220 must be the blindness of our heretics which leaves
them to argue in such a way that they either insist on the belief of another God supremely
good, on the ground of their thinking the Creator to be the author of evil, or else they set
up Matter with the Creator, in order that they may derive evil from Matter, not from the
Creator. And yet there is absolutely no god at all that is free from such a doubtful plight, so
as to be able to avoid the appearance even of being the author of evil, whosoever he is that—I
will not say, indeed, has made, but still—has permitted evil to be made by some author or
other, and from some source or other. Hermogenes, therefore, ought to be told6221 at once,
although we postpone to another place our distinction concerning the mode of evil,6222
that even he has effected no result by this device of his.6223 For observe how God is found
to be, if not the Author of, yet at any rate the conniver at,6224 evil, inasmuch as He, with all
His extreme goodness, endured evil in Matter before He created the world, although, as
being good, and the enemy of evil, He ought to have corrected it. For He either was able to
correct it, but was unwilling; or else was willing, but being a weak God, was not able. If He
was able and yet unwilling, He was Himself evil, as having favoured evil; and thus He now
opens Himself to the charge of evil, because even if He did not create it yet still, since it
would not be existing if He had been against its existence, He must Himself have then caused
it to exist, when He refused to will its non-existence. And what is more shameful than this?
When He willed that to be which He was Himself unwilling to create, He acted in fact against
His very self,6225 inasmuch as He was both willing that that should exist which He was unwilling
to make, and unwilling to make that which He was willing should exist. As if what

He willed was good, and at the same time what he refused to be the Maker of was evil. What
He judged to be evil by not creating it, He also proclaimed to be good by permitting it to
exist. By bearing with evil as a good instead of rather extirpating it, He proved Himself to
be the promoter thereof; criminally,6226 if through His own will—disgracefully, if through
necessity. God must either be the servant of evil or the friend thereof, since He held converse
with evil in Matter—nay, more, effected His works out of the evil thereof.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—Hermogenes Makes Great Efforts to Remove Evil from God to Matter.
How He Fails to Do This Consistently with His Own Argument.</head>
<p>But, after all,6227 by what proofs does Hermogenes persuade us that Matter is evil? For
it will be impossible for him not to call that evil to which he imputes evil. Now we lay down
this principle,6228 that what is eternal cannot possibly admit of diminution and subjection,
so as to be considered inferior to another co-eternal Being. So that we now affirm that evil
is not even compatible with it,6229 since it is incapable of subjection, from the fact that it
cannot in any wise be subject to any, because it is eternal. But inasmuch as, on other
grounds,6230 it is evident what is eternal as God is the highest good, whereby also He alone
is good—as being eternal, and therefore good—as being God, how can evil be inherent in
Matter, which (since it is eternal) must needs be believed to be the highest good? Else if that
which is eternal prove to be also capable of evil, this (evil) will be able to be also believed of
God to His prejudice;6231 so that it is without adequate reason that he has been so anxious6232
to remove evil from God; since evil must be compatible with an eternal Being, even by being
made compatible with Matter, as Hermogenes makes it. But, as the argument now stands,6233
since what is eternal can be deemed evil, the evil must prove to be invincible and insuperable,
as being eternal; and in that case6234 it will be in vain that we labour “to put away evil from
the midst of us;”6235 in that case, moreover, God vainly gives us such a command and precept;
nay more, in vain has God appointed any judgment at all, when He means, indeed,6236 to
inflict punishment with injustice. But if, on the other hand, there is to be an end of evil,
when the chief thereof, the devil, shall “go away into the fire which God hath prepared for
him and his angels”6237—having been first “cast into the bottomless pit;”6238 when likewise
“the manifestation of the children of God”6239 shall have “delivered the creature”6240 from

with evil, it must follow of necessity that a beginning is also compatible with it; and Matter
will turn out to have a beginning, by virtue of its having also an end. For whatever things

<head>Chapter XII.—The Mode of Controversy Changed. The Premisses of Hermogenes
Accepted, in Order to Show into What Confusion They Lead Him.</head>
<p>Come now, let us suppose Matter to be evil, nay, very evil, by nature of course, just as
we believe God to be good, even very good, in like manner by nature. Now nature must be
regarded as sure and fixed, just as persistently fixed in evil in the case of Matter, as immoveable
and unchangeable in good in the case of God. Because, as is evident,6247 if nature admits
of change from evil to good in Matter, it can be changed from good to evil in God. Here
some man will say, Then will “children not be raised up to Abraham from the stones?”6248
Will “generations of vipers not bring forth the fruit of repentance?”6249 And “children of
wrath” fail to become sons of peace, if nature be unchangeable? Your reference to such examples
as these, my friend,6250 is a thoughtless6251 one. For things which owe their existence
to birth such as stones and vipers and human beings—are not apposite to the case of Matter,
which is unborn; since their nature, by possessing a beginning, may have also a termination.
But bear in mind6252 that Matter has once for all been determined to be eternal, as being
unmade, unborn, and therefore supposably of an unchangeable and incorruptible nature;
and this from the very opinion of Hermogenes himself, which he alleges against us when
he denies that God was able to make (anything) of Himself, on the ground that what is
eternal is incapable of change, because it would lose—so the opinion runs6253—what it once
was, in becoming by the change that which it was not, if it were not eternal. But as for the
Lord, who is also eternal, (he maintained) that He could not be anything else than what He
always is. Well, then, I will adopt this definite opinion of his, and by means thereof refute
him. I blame Matter with a like censure, because out of it, evil though it be—nay, very
evil—good things have been created, nay, “very good” ones: “And God saw that they were
good, and God blessed them”6254—because, of course, of their very great goodness; certainly
not because they were evil, or very evil. Change is therefore admissible in Matter; and this
being the case, it has lost its condition of eternity; in short,6255 its beauty is decayed in
death.6256 Eternity, however, cannot be lost, because it cannot be eternity, except by reason

<head>Chapter XIII.—Another Ground of Hermogenes that Matter Has Some Good in It.
Its Absurdity.</head>
<p>Here the question will arise How creatures were made good out of it,6257 which were
formed without any change at all?6258 How occurs the seed of what is good, nay, very good,
in that which is evil, nay, very evil? Surely a good tree does not produce evil fruit,6259 since
there is no God who is not good; nor does an evil tree yield good fruit, since there is not
Matter except what is very evil. Or if we were to grant him that there is some germ of good
in it, then there will be no longer a uniform nature (pervading it), that is to say, one which
is evil throughout; but instead thereof (we now encounter) a double nature, partly good and
partly evil; and again the question will arise, whether, in a subject which is good and evil,
there could possibly have been found a harmony for light and darkness, for sweet and bitter?
So again, if qualities so utterly diverse as good and evil have been able to unite together,6260
and have imparted to Matter a double nature, productive of both kinds of fruit, then no
longer will absolutely6261 good things be imputable to God, just as evil things are not ascribed
to Him, but both qualities will appertain to Matter, since they are derived from the property
of Matter. At this rate, we shall owe to God neither gratitude for good things, nor grudge6262
for evil ones, because He has produced no work of His own proper character.6263 From
which circumstance will arise the clear proof that He has been subservient to Matter.</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—Tertullian Pushes His Opponent into a Dilemma.</head>
<p>Now, if it be also argued, that although Matter may have afforded Him the opportunity,
it was still His own will which led Him to the creation of good creatures, as having detected6264
what was good in matter—although this, too, be a discreditable supposition6265—yet,
at any rate, when He produces evil likewise out of the same (Matter), He is a servant to
Matter, since, of course,6266 it is not of His own accord that He produces this too, having
nothing else that He can do than to effect creation out of an evil stock6267—unwillingly, no
doubt, as being good; of necessity, too, as being unwilling; and as an act of servitude, because
from necessity. Which, then, is the worthier thought, that He created evil things of necessity,
or of His own accord? Because it was indeed of necessity that He created them, if out of
Matter; of His own accord, if out of nothing. For you are now labouring in vain when you
try to avoid making God the Author of evil things; because, since He made all things of
Matter, they will have to be ascribed to Himself, who made them, just because6268 He made
them. Plainly the interest of the question, whence He made all things, identifies itself with
(the question), whether He made all things out of nothing; and it matters not whence He
made all things, so that He made all things thence, whence most glory accrued to Him.6269
Now, more glory accrued to Him from a creation of His own will than from one of necessity;
in other words, from a creation out of nothing, than from one out of Matter. It is more
worthy to believe that God is free, even as the Author of evil, than that He is a slave. Power,
whatever it be, is more suited to Him than infirmity.6270 If we thus even admit that matter
had nothing good in it, but that the Lord produced whatever good He did produce of His
own power, then some other questions will with equal reason arise. First, since there was
no good at all in Matter, it is clear that good was not made of Matter, on the express ground
indeed that Matter did not possess it. Next, if good was not made of Matter, it must then
have been made of God; if not of God, then it must have been made of nothing.—For this
is the alternative, on Hermogenes’ own showing.6271</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—The Truth, that God Made All Things from Nothing, Rescued from
the Opponent’s Flounderings.</head>
<p>Now, if good was neither produced out of matter, since it was not in it, evil as it was,
nor out of God, since, according to the position of Hermogenes, nothing could have been
produced out of god, it will be found that good was created out of nothing, inasmuch as it
was formed of none—neither of Matter nor of God. And if good was formed out of nothing,
why not evil too? Nay, if anything was formed out of nothing, why not all things? Unless
indeed it be that the divine might was insufficient for the production of all things, though
it produced a something out of nothing. Or else if good proceeded from evil matter, since
it issued neither from nothing nor from God, it will follow that it must have proceeded from
the conversion of Matter contrary to that unchangeable attribute which has been claimed
for it, as an eternal being.6272 Thus, in regard to the source whence good derived its existence,
Hermogenes will now have to deny the possibility of such. But still it is necessary that (good)
should proceed from some one of those sources from which he has denied the very possibility
of its having been derived. Now if evil be denied to be of nothing for the purpose of
denying it to be the work of God, from whose will there would be too much appearance of
its being derived, and be alleged to proceed from Matter, that it may be the property of that
very thing of whose substance it is assumed to be made, even here also, as I have said, God
will have to be regarded as the Author of evil; because, whereas it had been His duty6273 to
produce all good things out of Matter, or rather good things simply, by His identical attribute
of power and will, He did yet not only not produce all good things, but even (some) evil
things—of course, either willing that the evil should exist if He was able to cause their nonexistence,
or not being strong enough to effect that all things should be good, if being desirous
of that result, He failed in the accomplishment thereof; since there can be no difference
whether it were by weakness or by will, that the Lord proved to be the Author of evil. Else
what was the reason that, after creating good things, as if Himself good, He should have
also produced evil things, as if He failed in His goodness, since He did not confine Himself
to the production of things which were simply consistent with Himself? What necessity was
there, after the production of His proper work, for His troubling Himself about Matter also
by producing evil likewise, in order to secure His being alone acknowledged as good from

which has been denied (by Hermogenes) to be possible.” It will be obvious why we have, in connection with the
preceding clause preferred the equivalent rendering of our text. For the denial of Hermogenes, which Tertullian
refers to, see above, chap. xii. p. 484.</note>

<pb n="1061"/>
His good, and at the same time6274 to prevent Matter being regarded as evil from (created)
evil? Good would have flourished much better if evil had not blown upon it. For Hermogenes
himself explodes the arguments of sundry persons who contend that evil things were necessary
to impart lustre to the good, which must be understood from their contrasts. This,
therefore, was not the ground for the production of evil; but if some other reason must be
sought for the introduction thereof, why could it not have been introduced even from
nothing,6275 since the very same reason would exculpate the Lord from the reproach of
being thought the author of evil, which now excuses the existence of evil things, when He
produces them out of Matter? And if there is this excuse, then the question is completely6276
shut up in a corner, where they are unwilling to find it, who, without examining into the
reason itself of evil, or distinguishing how they should either attribute it to God or separate
it from God, do in fact expose God to many most unworthy calumnies.6277</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—A Series of Dilemmas. They Show that Hermogenes Cannot Escape
from the Orthodox Conclusion.</head>
<p>On the very threshold,6278 then, of this doctrine,6279 which I shall probably have to
treat of elsewhere, I distinctly lay it down as my position, that both good and evil must be
ascribed either to God, who made them out of Matter; or to Matter itself, out of which He
made them; or both one and the other to both of them together,6280 because they are bound
together—both He who created, and that out of which He created; or (lastly) one to One
and the other to the Other,6281 because after Matter and God there is not a third. Now if
both should prove to belong to God, God evidently will be the author of evil; but God, as
being good, cannot be the author of evil. Again, if both are ascribed to Matter, Matter will
evidently be the very mother of good,6282 but inasmuch as Matter is wholly evil, it cannot
be the mother of good. But if both one and the other should be thought to belong to Both
together, then in this case also Matter will be comparable with God; and both will be equal,
being on equal terms allied to evil as well as to good. Matter, however, ought not to be
compared with God, in order that it may not make two gods. If, (lastly,) one be ascribed to
One, and the other to the Other—that is to say, let the good be God’s, and the evil belong
to Matter—then, on the one hand, evil must not be ascribed to God, nor, on the other hand,
good to Matter. And God, moreover, by making both good things and evil things out of
Matter, creates them along with it. This being the case, I cannot tell how Hermogenes6283
is to escape from my conclusion; for he supposes that God cannot be the author of evil, in
what way soever He created evil out of Matter, whether it was of His own will, or of necessity,
or from the reason (of the case). If, however, He is the author of evil, who was the actual
Creator, Matter being simply associated with Him by reason of its furnishing Him with
substance,6284 you now do away with the cause6285 of your introducing Matter. For it is not
the less true, that it is by means of Matter that God shows Himself the author of evil, although
Matter has been assumed by you expressly to prevent God’s seeming to be the author of evil.

<pb n="1063"/>
Matter being therefore excluded, since the cause of it is excluded, it remains that God without
doubt, must have made all things out of nothing. Whether evil things were amongst them
we shall see, when it shall be made clear what are evil things, and whether those things are
evil which you at present deem to be so. For it is more worthy of God that He produced
even these of His own will, by producing them out of nothing, than from the predetermination
of another,6286 (which must have been the case) if He had produced them out of
Matter. It is liberty, not necessity, which suits the character of God. I would much rather
that He should have even willed to create evil of Himself, than that He should have lacked
ability to hinder its creation.</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.—The Truth of God’s Work in Creation. You Cannot Depart in the

<p>This rule is required by the nature of the One-only God,6287 who is One-only in no
other way than as the sole God; and in no other way sole, than as having nothing else (coexistent)

are after Him, because all things are by Him; and all things are by Him, because they are of
nothing: so that reason coincides with the Scripture, which says: “Who hath known the
mind of the Lord? or who hath been His counsellor? or with whom took He counsel? or
who hath shown to Him the way of wisdom and knowledge? Who hath first given to Him,
and it shall be recompensed to him again?”6288 Surely none! Because there was present
with Him no power, no material, no nature which belonged to any other than Himself. But
if it was with some (portion of Matter)6289 that He effected His creation, He must have received
from that (Matter) itself both the design and the treatment of its order as being “the
way of wisdom and knowledge.” For He had to operate conformably with the quality of the
thing, and according to the nature of Matter, not according to His own will in consequence
of which He must have made6290 even evil things suitably to the nature not of Himself, but
of Matter.</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—An Eulogy on the Wisdom and Word of God, by Which God Made
All Things of Nothing.</head>
<p>If any material was necessary to God in the creation of the world, as Hermogenes supposed,
God had a far nobler and more suitable one in His own wisdom6291—one which was
not to be gauged by the writings of6292 philosophers, but to be learnt from the words or
prophets. This alone, indeed, knew the mind of the Lord. For “who knoweth the things of
God, and the things in God, but the Spirit, which is in Him?”6293 Now His wisdom is that
Spirit. This was His counsellor, the very way of His wisdom and knowledge.6294 Of this He
made all things, making them through It, and making them with It. “When He prepared
the heavens,” so says (the Scripture6295), “I was present with Him; and when He strengthened
above the winds the lofty clouds, and when He secured the fountains6296 which are under
the heaven, I was present, compacting these things6297 along with Him. I was He6298 in
whom He took delight; moreover, I daily rejoiced in His presence: for He rejoiced when He
had finished the world, and amongst the sons of men did He show forth His pleasure.”6299
Now, who would not rather approve of6300 this as the fountain and origin of all things—of
this as, in very deed, the Matter of all Matter, not liable to any end,6301 not diverse in condition,
not restless in motion, not ungraceful in form, but natural, and proper, and duly proportioned,
and beautiful, such truly as even God might well have required, who requires
His own and not another’s? Indeed, as soon as He perceived It to be necessary for His creation
of the world, He immediately creates It, and generates It in Himself. “The Lord,” says the
Scripture, “possessed6302 me, the beginning of His ways for the creation of His works. Before
the worlds He founded me; before He made the earth, before the mountains were settled in
their places; moreover, before the hills He generated me, and prior to the depths was I be-

gotten.”6303 Let Hermogenes then confess that the very Wisdom of God is declared to be
born and created, for the especial reason that we should not suppose that there is any other
being than God alone who is unbegotten and uncreated. For if that, which from its being
inherent in the Lord6304 was of Him and in Him, was yet not without a beginning,—I
mean6305 His wisdom, which was then born and created, when in the thought of God It
began to assume motion6306 for the arrangement of His creative works,—how much more
impossible6307 is it that anything should have been without a beginning which was extrinsic
to the Lord!6308 But if this same Wisdom is the Word of God, in the capacity6309 of Wisdom,
and (as being He) without whom nothing was made, just as also (nothing) was set in order
without Wisdom, how can it be that anything, except the Father, should be older, and on
this account indeed nobler, than the Son of God, the only-begotten and first-begotten Word?
Not to say that6310 what is unbegotten is stronger than that which is born, and what is not
made more powerful than that which is made. Because that which did not require a Maker
to give it existence, will be much more elevated in rank than that which had an author to
bring it into being. On this principle, then,6311 if evil is indeed unbegotten, whilst the Son
of God is begotten (“for,” says God, “my heart hath emitted my most excellent Word”6312),
I am not quite sure that evil may not be introduced by good, the stronger by the weak, in
the same way as the unbegotten is by the begotten. Therefore on this ground Hermogenes
puts Matter even before God, by putting it before the Son. Because the Son is the Word,
and “the Word is God,”6313 and “I and my Father are one.”6314 But after all, perhaps,6315
the Son will patiently enough submit to having that preferred before Him which (by Hermogenes),
is made equal to the Father!</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—An Appeal to the History of Creation. True Meaning of the Term
Beginning, Which the Heretic Curiously Wrests to an Absurd Sense.</head>
<p>But I shall appeal to the original document6316 of Moses, by help of which they on the
other side vainly endeavour to prop up their conjectures, with the view, of course, of appearing
to have the support of that authority which is indispensable in such an inquiry. They
have found their opportunity, as is usual with heretics, in wresting the plain meaning of
certain words. For instance the very beginning,6317 when God made the heaven and the
earth, they will construe as if it meant something substantial and embodied,6318 to be regarded
as Matter. We, however, insist on the proper signification of every word, and say
that principium means beginning,—being a term which is suitable to represent things which
begin to exist. For nothing which has come into being is without a beginning, nor can this
its commencement be at any other moment than when it begins to have existence. Thus
principium or beginning, is simply a term of inception, not the name of a substance. Now,
inasmuch as the heaven and the earth are the principal works of God, and since, by His
making them first, He constituted them in an especial manner the beginning of His creation,
before all things else, with good reason does the Scripture preface (its record of creation)
with the words, “In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth;”6319 just as it would
have said, “At last God made the heaven and the earth,” if God had created these after all
the rest. Now, if the beginning is a substance, the end must also be material. No doubt, a
substantial thing6320 may be the beginning of some other thing which may be formed out
of it; thus the clay is the beginning of the vessel, and the seed is the beginning of the plant.
But when we employ the word beginning in this sense of origin, and not in that of order, we
do not omit to mention also the name of that particular thing which we regard as the origin
of the other. On the other hand,6321 if we were to make such a statement as this, for example,
“In the beginning the potter made a basin or a water-jug,” the word beginning will not here
indicate a material substance (for I have not mentioned the clay, which is the beginning in
this sense, but only the order of the work, meaning that the potter made the basin and the
jug first, before anything else—intending afterwards to make the rest. It is, then, to the order
of the works that the word beginning has reference, not to the origin of their substances. I
might also explain this word beginning in another way, which would not, however, be inap-

posite.6322 The Greek term for beginning, which is ἀρχή, admits the sense not only of priority
of order, but of power as well; whence princes and magistrates are called ἀρχοντες. Therefore
in this sense too, beginning may be taken for princely authority and power. It was, indeed,
in His transcendent authority and power, that God made the heaven and the earth.</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—Meaning of the Phrase—In the Beginning. Tertullian Connects It
with the Wisdom of God, and Elicits from It the Truth that the Creation Was
Not Out of Pre-Existent Matter.</head>
<p>But in proof that the Greek word means nothing else than beginning, and that beginning
admits of no other sense than the initial one, we have that (Being)6323 even acknowledging
such a beginning, who says: “The Lord possessed6324 me, the beginning of His ways for the
creation of His works.”6325 For since all things were made by the Wisdom of God, it follows
that, when God made both the heaven and the earth in principio—that is to say, in the beginning—
He made them in His Wisdom. If, indeed, beginning had a material signification,
the Scripture would not have informed us that God made so and so in principio, at the beginning,
but rather ex principio, of the beginning; for He would not have created in, but of,
matter. When Wisdom, however, was referred to, it was quite right to say, in the beginning.
For it was in Wisdom that He made all things at first, because by meditating and arranging
His plans therein,6326 He had in fact already done (the work of creation); and if He had
even intended to create out of matter, He would yet have effected His creation when He
previously meditated on it and arranged it in His Wisdom, since It6327 was in fact the beginning
of His ways: this meditation and arrangement being the primal operation of Wisdom,
opening as it does the way to the works by the act of meditation and thought.6328 This authority
of Scripture I claim for myself even from this circumstance, that whilst it shows me
the God who created, and the works He created, it does not in like manner reveal to me the
source from which He created. For since in every operation there are three principal things,
He who makes, and that which is made, and that of which it is made, there must be three
names mentioned in a correct narrative of the operation—the person of the maker the sort
of thing which is made,6329 and the material of which it is formed. If the material is not
mentioned, while the work and the maker of the work are both mentioned, it is manifest
that He made the work out of nothing. For if He had had anything to operate upon, it would
have been mentioned as well as (the other two particulars).6330 In conclusion, I will apply
the Gospel as a supplementary testimony to the Old Testament. Now in this there is all the

greater reason why there should be shown the material (if there were any) out of which God
made all things, inasmuch as it is therein plainly revealed by whom He made all things. “In
the beginning was the Word”6331—that is, the same beginning, of course, in which God
made the heaven and the earth6332—“and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
All things were made by Him, and without Him nothing was made.”6333 Now, since we
have here clearly told us who the Maker was, that is, God, and what He made, even all things,
and through whom He made them, even His Word, would not the order of the narrative
have required that the source out of which all things were made by God through the Word
should likewise be declared, if they had been in fact made out of anything? What, therefore,
did not exist, the Scripture was unable to mention; and by not mentioning it, it has given
us a clear proof that there was no such thing: for if there had been, the Scripture would have
mentioned it.</p>

ground that it is not told us that anything was made out of pre-existent Matter, take care

that they are on that account fairly admissible, where there is a diversity in the cause. For I
maintain that, even if the Scripture has not expressly declared that all things were made out
of nothing—just as it abstains (from saying that they were formed) out of Matter—there
was no such pressing need for expressly indicating the creation of all things out of nothing,
as there was of their creation out of Matter, if that had been their origin. Because, in the
case of what is made out of nothing, the very fact of its not being indicated that it was made
of any particular thing shows that it was made of nothing; and there is no danger of its being
supposed that it was made of anything, when there is no indication at all of what it was made
of. In the case, however, of that which is made out of something, unless the very fact be
plainly declared, that it was made out of something, there will be danger, until6335 it is shown
of what it was made, first of its appearing to be made of nothing, because it is not said of
what it was made; and then, should it be of such a nature6336 as to have the appearance of
having certainly been made of something, there will be a similar risk of its seeming to have
been made of a far different material from the proper one, so long as there is an absence of
statement of what it was made of. Then, if God had been unable to make all things of
nothing, the Scripture could not possibly have added that He had made all things of nothing:
(there could have been no room for such a statement,) but it must by all means have informed
us that He had made all things out of Matter, since Matter must have been the source; because
the one case was quite to be understood,6337 if it were not actually stated, whereas the other
case would be left in doubt unless it were stated.</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—This Conclusion Confirmed by the Usage of Holy Scripture in Its
History of the Creation. Hermogenes in Danger of the Woe Pronounced Against
Adding to Scripture.</head>
<p>And to such a degree has the Holy Ghost made this the rule of His Scripture, that
whenever anything is made out of anything, He mentions both the thing that is made and
the thing of which it is made. “Let the earth,” says He, “bring forth grass, the herb yielding
seed, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit after its kind, whose seed is in itself, after its kind. And
it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after its kind, and the
tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after its kind.”6338 And again: “And God said,
Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creatures that have life, and fowl that may
fly above the earth through the firmament of heaven. And it was so. And God created great
whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly,
after their kind.”6339 Again afterwards: “And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living
creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beasts of the earth after their kind.”6340
If therefore God, when producing other things out of things which had been already made,
indicates them by the prophet, and tells us what He has produced from such and such a
source6341 (although we might ourselves suppose them to be derived from some source or
other, short of nothing;6342 since there had already been created certain things, from which
they might easily seem to have been made); if the Holy Ghost took upon Himself so great
a concern for our instruction, that we might know from what everything was produced,6343
would He not in like manner have kept us well informed about both the heaven and the
earth, by indicating to us what it was that He made them of, if their original consisted of
any material substance, so that the more He seemed to have made them of nothing, the less
in fact was there as yet made, from which He could appear to have made them? Therefore,
just as He shows us the original out of which He drew such things as were derived from a
given source, so also with regard to those things of which He does not point out whence He
produced them, He confirms (by that silence our assertion) that they were produced out of
nothing. “In the beginning,” then, “God made the heaven and the earth.”6344 I revere6345

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Hermogenes Pursued to Another Passage of Scripture. The Absurdity
of His Interpretation Exposed.</head>
<p>But he draws an argument from the following words, where it is written: “And the earth
was without form, and void.”6349 For he resolves6350 the word earth into Matter, because
that which is made out of it is the earth. And to the word was he gives the same direction,
as if it pointed to what had always existed unbegotten and unmade. It was without form,
moreover, and void, because he will have Matter to have existed shapeless and confused,
and without the finish of a maker’s hand.6351 Now these opinions of his I will refute singly;
but first I wish to say to him, by way of general answer: We are of opinion that Matter is
pointed at in these terms. But yet does the Scripture intimate that, because Matter was in
existence before all, anything of like condition6352 was even formed out of it? Nothing of
the kind. Matter might have had existence, if it so pleased—or rather if Hermogenes so
pleased. It might, I say, have existed, and yet God might not have made anything out of it,
either as it was unsuitable to Him to have required the aid of anything, or at least because
He is not shown to have made anything out of Matter. Its existence must therefore be without
a cause, you will say. Oh, no! certainly6353 not without cause. For even if the world were
not made out of it, yet a heresy has been hatched there from; and a specially impudent one
too, because it is not Matter which has produced the heresy, but the heresy has rather made
Matter itself.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—Earth Does Not Mean Matter as Hermogenes Would Have It.</head>
<p>I now return to the several points6354 by means of which he thought that Matter was
491
signified. And first I will inquire about the terms. For we read only of one of them, Earth;
the other, namely Matter, we do not meet with. I ask, then, since Matter is not mentioned
in Scripture, how the term earth can be applied to it, which marks a substance of another
kind? There is all the greater need why mention should also have been made of Matter, if
this has acquired the further sense of Earth, in order that I may be sure that Earth is one
and the same name as Matter, and so not claim the designation for merely one substance,
as the proper name thereof, and by which it is better known; or else be unable (if I should
feel the inclination), to apply it to some particular species of Matter, instead, indeed,6355 of
making it the common term6356 of all Matter. For when a proper name does not exist for
that thing to which a common term is ascribed, the less apparent6357 is the object to which
it may be ascribed, the more capable will it be of being applied to any other object whatever.
Therefore, even supposing that Hermogenes could show us the name6358 Matter, he is
bound to prove to us further, that the same object has the surname6359 Earth, in order that
he may claim for it both designations alike.</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—The Assumption that There are Two Earths Mentioned in the History
of the Creation, Refuted.</head>
<p>He accordingly maintains that there are two earths set before us in the passage in
question: one, which God made in the beginning; the other being the Matter of which God
made the world, and concerning which it is said, “And the earth was without form, and
void.”6360 Of course, if I were to ask, to which of the two earths the name earth is best
suited,6361 I shall be told that the earth which was made derived the appellation from that
of which it was made, on the ground that it is more likely that the offspring should get its
name from the original, than the original from the offspring. This being the case, another
question presents itself to us, whether it is right and proper that this earth which God made
should have derived its name from that out of which He made it? For I find from Hermogenes
and the rest of the Materialist heretics,6362 that while the one earth was indeed “without
form, and void,” this one of ours obtained from God in an equal degree6363 both form, and
beauty, and symmetry; and therefore that the earth which was created was a different thing
from that out of which it was created. Now, having become a different thing, it could not
possibly have shared with the other in its name, after it had declined from its condition. If
earth was the proper name of the (original) Matter, this world of ours, which is not Matter,
because it has become another thing, is unfit to bear the name of earth, seeing that that
name belongs to something else, and is a stranger to its nature. But (you will tell me) Matter
which has undergone creation, that is, our earth, had with its original a community of name
no less than of kind. By no means. For although the pitcher is formed out of the clay, I shall
no longer call it clay, but a pitcher; so likewise, although electrum6364 is compounded of
gold and silver, I shall yet not call it either gold or silver, but electrum. When there is a departure
from the nature of any thing, there is likewise a relinquishment of its name—with
a propriety which is alike demanded by the designation and the condition. How great a
change indeed from the condition of that earth, which is Matter, has come over this earth
of ours, is plain even from the fact that the latter has received this testimony to its goodness
in Genesis, “And God saw that it was good;”6365 while the former, according to Hermogenes,
is regarded as the origin and cause of all evils. Lastly, if the one is Earth because the other
is, why also is the one not Matter as the other is? Indeed, by this rule both the heaven and

all creatures ought to have had the names of Earth and Matter, since they all consist of
Matter. I have said enough touching the designation Earth, by which he will have it that
Matter is understood. This, as everybody knows, is the name of one of the elements; for so
we are taught by nature first, and afterwards by Scripture, except it be that credence must
be given to that Silenus who talked so confidently in the presence of king Midas of another
world, according to the account of Theopompus. But the same author informs us that there
are also several gods.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—The Method Observed in the History of the Creation, in Reply to
the Perverse Interpretation of Hermogenes.</head>
<p>We, however, have but one God, and but one earth too, which in the beginning God
made.6366 The Scripture, which at its very outset proposes to run through the order thereof
tells us as its first information that it was created; it next proceeds to set forth what sort of
earth it was.6367 In like manner with respect to the heaven, it informs us first of its creation—“
In the beginning God made the heaven:”6368 it then goes on to introduce its arrangement;
how that God both separated “the water which was below the firmament from that
which was above the firmament,”6369 and called the firmament heaven,6370—the very thing
He had created in the beginning. Similarly it (afterwards) treats of man: “And God created
man, in the image of God made He him.”6371 It next reveals how He made him: “And (the
Lord) God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath
of life; and man became a living soul.”6372 Now this is undoubtedly6373 the correct and fitting
mode for the narrative. First comes a prefatory statement, then follow the details in full;6374
first the subject is named, then it is described.6375 How absurd is the other view of the account,
6376 when even before he6377 had premised any mention of his subject, i.e. Matter,
without even giving us its name, he all on a sudden promulged its form and condition, describing
to us its quality before mentioning its existence,—pointing out the figure of the
thing formed, but concealing its name! But how much more credible is our opinion, which
holds that Scripture has only subjoined the arrangement of the subject after it has first duly
described its formation and mentioned its name! Indeed, how full and complete6378 is the

<p>But you next praise your eyebrows, and toss back your head, and beckon with your
finger, in characteristic disdain,6385 and say: There is the was, looking as if it pointed to an
eternal existence,—making its subject, of course, unbegotten and unmade, and on that account
worthy of being supposed to be Matter. Well now, for my own part, I shall resort to
no affected protestation,6386 but simply reply that “was” may be predicated of
everything—even of a thing which has been created, which was born, which once was not,
and which is not your Matter. For of everything which has being, from whatever source it
has it, whether it has it by a beginning or without a beginning, the word “was” will be predicated
from the very fact that it exists. To whatever thing the first tense6387 of the verb is
applicable for definition, to the same will be suitable the later form6388 of the verb, when it
has to descend to relation. “Est” (it is) forms the essential part6389 of a definition, “erat” (it
was) of a relation. Such are the trifles and subtleties of heretics, who wrest and bring into
question the simple meaning of the commonest words. A grand question it is, to be sure,6390
whether “the earth was,” which was made! The real point of discussion is, whether “being
without form, and void,” is a state which is more suitable to that which was created, or to
that of which it was created, so that the predicate (was) may appertain to the same thing to
which the subject (that which was) also belongs.6391</p>

<head>Chapter XXVIII.—A Curious Inconsistency in Hermogenes Exposed. Certain Expressions
in The History of Creation Vindicated in The True Sense.</head>
<p>But we shall show not only that this condition6392 agreed with this earth of ours, but
that it did not agree with that other (insisted on by Hermogenes). For, inasmuch as pure
Matter was thus subsistent with God,6393 without the interposition indeed of any element
at all (because as yet there existed nothing but itself and God), it could not of course have
been invisible. Because, although Hermogenes contends that darkness was inherent in the
substance of Matter, a position which we shall have to meet in its proper place,6394 yet
darkness is visible even to a human being (for the very fact that there is the darkness is an
evident one), much more is it so to God. If indeed it6395 had been invisible, its quality would
not have been by any means discoverable. How, then, did Hermogenes find out6396 that
that substance was “without form,” and confused and disordered, which, as being invisible,
was not palpable to his senses? If this mystery was revealed to him by God, he ought to give
us his proof. I want to know also, whether (the substance in question) could have been described
as “void.” That certainly is “void” which is imperfect. Equally certain is it, that
nothing can be imperfect but that which is made; it is imperfect when it is not fully made.6397
Certainly, you admit. Matter, therefore, which was not made at all, could not have been
imperfect; and what was not imperfect was not “void.” Having no beginning, because it was
not made, it was also unsusceptible of any void-condition.6398 For this void-condition is
an accident of beginning. The earth, on the contrary, which was made, was deservedly called
“void.” For as soon as it was made, it had the condition of being imperfect, previous to its
completion.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIX.—The Gradual Development of Cosmical Order Out of Chaos in the
Creation, Beautifully Stated.</head>
<p>God, indeed, consummated all His works in a due order; at first He paled them out,6399
as it were, in their unformed elements, and then He arranged them6400 in their finished
beauty. For He did not all at once inundate light with the splendour of the sun, nor all at
once temper darkness with the moon’s assuaging ray.6401 The heaven He did not all at once
bedeck6402 with constellations and stars, nor did He at once fill the seas with their teeming
monsters.6403 The earth itself He did not endow with its varied fruitfulness all at once; but
at first He bestowed upon it being, and then He filled it, that it might not be made in vain.6404
For thus says Isaiah: “He created it not in vain; He formed it to be inhabited.”6405 Therefore
after it was made, and while awaiting its perfect state,6406 it was “without form, and void:”
“void” indeed, from the very fact that it was without form (as being not yet perfect to the
sight, and at the same time unfurnished as yet with its other qualities);6407 and “without
form,” because it was still covered with waters, as if with the rampart of its fecundating
moisture,6408 by which is produced our flesh, in a form allied with its own. For to this purport
does David say:6409 “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all that
dwell therein: He hath founded it upon the seas, and on the streams hath He established
it.”6410 It was when the waters were withdrawn into their hollow abysses that the dry land
became conspicuous,6411 which was hitherto covered with its watery envelope. Then it
forthwith becomes “visible,”6412 God saying, “Let the water be gathered together into one

mass,6413 and let the dry land appear.”6414 “Appear,” says He, not “be made.” It had been
already made, only in its invisible condition it was then waiting6415 to appear. “Dry,” because
it was about to become such by its severance from the moisture, but yet “land.” “And God
called the dry land Earth,”6416 not Matter. And so, when it afterwards attains its perfection,
it ceases to be accounted void, when God declares, “Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
yielding seed after its kind, and according to its likeness, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit,
whose seed is in itself, after its kind.”6417 Again: “Let the earth bring forth the living creature
after his kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth, after their kind.”6418 Thus
the divine Scripture accomplished its full order. For to that, which it had at first described
as “without form (invisible) and void,” it gave both visibility and completion. Now no other
Matter was “without form (invisible) and void.” Henceforth, then, Matter will have to be
visible and complete. So that I must6419 see Matter, since it has become visible. I must
likewise recognize it as a completed thing, so as to be able to gather from it the herb bearing
seed, and the tree yielding fruit, and that living creatures, made out of it, may minister to
my need. Matter, however, is nowhere,6420 but the Earth is here, confessed to my view. I
see it, I enjoy it, ever since it ceased to be “without form (invisible), and void.” Concerning
it most certainly did Isaiah speak when he said, “Thus saith the Lord that created the heavens,
He was the God that formed the earth, and made it.”6421 The same earth for certain did He
form, which He also made. Now how did He form6422 it? Of course by saying, “Let the dry
land appear.”6423 Why does He command it to appear, if it were not previously invisible?
His purpose was also, that He might thus prevent His having made it in vain, by rendering
it visible, and so fit for use. And thus, throughout, proofs arise to us that this earth which
we inhabit is the very same which was both created and formed6424 by God, and that none
other was “Without form, and void,” than that which had been created and formed. It

<head>Chapter XXX.—Another Passage in the Sacred History of the Creation, Released
from the Mishandling of Hermogenes.</head>
<p>The following words will in like manner apparently corroborate the conjecture of Hermogenes,
“And darkness was upon the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God moved upon
the face of the water;”6426 as if these blended6427 substances, presented us with arguments
for his massive pile of Matter.6428 Now, so discriminating an enumeration of certain and
distinct elements (as we have in this passage), which severally designates “darkness,” “the
deep,” “the Spirit of God,” “the waters,” forbids the inference that anything confused or
(from such confusion) uncertain is meant. Still more, when He ascribed to them their own
places,6429 “darkness on the face of the deep,” “the Spirit upon the face of the waters,” He
repudiated all confusion in the substances; and by demonstrating their separate position,6430
He demonstrated also their distinction. Most absurd, indeed, would it be that Matter, which
is introduced to our view as “without form,” should have its “formless” condition maintained
by so many words indicative of form,6431 without any intimation of what that confused
body6432 is, which must of course be supposed to be unique,6433 since it is without form.6434
For that which is without form is uniform; but even6435 that which is without form, when
it is blended together6436 from various component parts,6437 must necessarily have one
outward appearance;6438 and it has not any appearance, until it has the one appearance
(which comes) from many parts combined.6439 Now Matter either had those specific parts6440
within itself, from the words indicative of which it had to be understood—I mean “darkness,”
and “the deep,” and “the Spirit,” and “the waters”—or it had them not. If it had them, how

<head>Chapter XXXI.—A Further Vindication of the Scripture Narrative of the Creation,
Against a Futile View of Hermogenes.</head>
<p>But this circumstance, too, will be caught at, that Scripture meant to indicate of the
heaven only, and this earth of yours,6443 that God made it in the beginning, while nothing
of the kind is said of the above-mentioned specific parts;6444 and therefore that these, which
are not described as having been made, appertain to unformed Matter. To this point6445
also we must give an answer. Holy Scripture would be sufficiently explicit, if it had declared
that the heaven and the earth, as the very highest works of creation, were made by God,
possessing of course their own special appurtenances,6446 which might be understood to
be implied in these highest works themselves. Now the appurtenances of the heaven and
the earth, made then in the beginning, were the darkness and the deep, and the spirit, and
the waters. For the depth and the darkness underlay the earth. Since the deep was under
the earth, and the darkness was over the deep, undoubtedly both the darkness and the deep
were under the earth. Below the heaven, too, lay the spirit6447 and the waters. For since the
waters were over the earth, which they covered, whilst the spirit was over the waters, both
the spirit and the waters were alike over the earth. Now that which is over the earth, is of
course under the heaven. And even as the earth brooded over the deep and the darkness,
so also did the heaven brood over the spirit and the waters, and embrace them. Nor, indeed,
is there any novelty in mentioning only that which contains, as pertaining to the whole,6448
and understanding that which is contained as included in it, in its character of a portion.6449
Suppose now I should say the city built a theatre and a circus, but the stage6450 was of such
and such a kind, and the statues were on the canal, and the obelisk was reared above them
all, would it follow that, because I did not distinctly state that these specific things6451 were
made by the city, they were therefore not made by it along with the circus and the theatre?
Did I not, indeed, refrain from specially mentioning the formation of these particular things
because they were implied in the things which I had already said were made, and might be
understood to be inherent in the things in which they were contained? But this example

may be an idle one as being derived from a human circumstance; I will take another, which
has the authority of Scripture itself. It says that “God made man of the dust of the ground
and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.”6452 Now,
although it here mentions the nostrils,6453 it does not say that they were made by God; so
again it speaks of skin6454 and bones, and flesh and eyes, and sweat and blood, in subsequent
passages,6455 and yet it never intimated that they had been created by God. What will Hermogenes
have to answer? That the human limbs must belong to Matter, because they are
not specially mentioned as objects of creation? Or are they included in the formation of
man? In like manner, the deep and the darkness, and the spirit and the waters, were as
members of the heaven and the earth. For in the bodies the limbs were made, in the bodies
the limbs too were mentioned. No element but what is a member of that element in which
it is contained. But all elements are contained in the heaven and the earth.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXII.—The Account of the Creation in Genesis a General One, Corroborated,
However, by Many Other Passages of the Old Testament, Which Give
Account of Specific Creations. Further Cavillings Confuted.</head>
<p>This is the answer I should give in defence of the Scripture before us, for seeming here
to set forth6456 the formation of the heaven and the earth, as if (they were) the sole bodies
made. It could not but know that there were those who would at once in the bodies understand
their several members also, and therefore it employed this concise mode of speech.
But, at the same time, it foresaw that there would be stupid and crafty men, who, after paltering
with the virtual meaning,6457 would require for the several members a word descriptive
of their formation too. It is therefore because of such persons, that Scripture in other passages
teaches us of the creation of the individual parts. You have Wisdom saying, “But before the
depths was I brought forth,”6458 in order that you may believe that the depths were also
“brought forth”—that is, created—just as we create sons also, though we “bring them forth.”
It matters not whether the depth was made or born, so that a beginning be accorded to it,
which however would not be, if it were subjoined6459 to matter. Of darkness, indeed, the
Lord Himself by Isaiah says, “I formed the light, and I created darkness.”6460 Of the wind6461
also Amos says, “He that strengtheneth the thunder6462, and createth the wind, and declareth
His Christ6463 unto men;”6464 thus showing that that wind was created which was reckoned
with the formation of the earth, which was wafted over the waters, balancing and refreshing
and animating all things: not (as some suppose) meaning God Himself by the spirit,6465 on
the ground that “God is a Spirit,”6466 because the waters would not be able to bear up their
Lord; but He speaks of that spirit of which the winds consist, as He says by Isaiah, “Because

my spirit went forth from me, and I made every blast.”6467 In like manner the same Wisdom
says of the waters, “Also when He made the fountains strong, things which6468 are under
the sky, I was fashioning6469 them along with Him.”6470 Now, when we prove that these
particular things were created by God, although they are only mentioned in Genesis, without
any intimation of their having been made, we shall perhaps receive from the other side the
reply, that these were made, it is true,6471 but out of Matter, since the very statement of
Moses, “And darkness was on the face of the deep, and the spirit of God moved on the face
of the waters,”6472 refers to Matter, as indeed do all those other Scriptures here and there,6473
which demonstrate that the separate parts were made out of Matter. It must follow, then,6474
that as earth consisted of earth, so also depth consisted of depth, and darkness of darkness,
and the wind and waters of wind and waters. And, as we said above,6475 Matter could not
have been without form, since it had specific parts, which were formed out of it—although
as separate things6476—unless, indeed, they were not separate, but were the very same with
those out of which they came. For it is really impossible that those specific things, which
are set forth under the same names, should have been diverse; because in that case6477 the
operation of God might seem to be useless,6478 if it made things which existed already; since
that alone would be a creation,6479 when things came into being, which had not been (previously)
made. Therefore, to conclude, either Moses then pointed to Matter when he wrote
the words: “And darkness was on the face of the deep, and the spirit of God moved on the
face of the waters;” or else, inasmuch as these specific parts of creation are afterwards shown
in other passages to have been made by God, they ought to have been with equal explicitness6480
shown to have been made out of the Matter which, according to you, Moses had

<head>Chapter XXXIII.—Statement of the True Doctrine Concerning Matter. Its Relation

<p>But although Hermogenes finds it amongst his own colourable pretences6482 (for it was
not in his power to discover it in the Scriptures of God), it is enough for us, both that it is
certain that all things were made by God, and that there is no certainty whatever that they
were made out of Matter. And even if Matter had previously existed, we must have believed
that it had been really made by God, since we maintained (no less) when we held the rule
of faith to be,6483 that nothing except God was uncreated.6484 Up to this point there is room
for controversy, until Matter is brought to the test of the Scriptures, and fails to make good
its case.6485 The conclusion of the whole is this: I find that there was nothing made, except
out of nothing; because that which I find was made, I know did not once exist. Whatever6486
was made out of something, has its origin in something made: for instance, out of the ground
was made the grass, and the fruit, and the cattle, and the form of man himself; so from the
waters were produced the animals which swim and fly. The original fabrics6487 out of which
such creatures were produced I may call their materials,6488 but then even these were created
by God.</p>

Figurative.</head>
<p>Besides,6489 the belief that everything was made from nothing will be impressed upon
us by that ultimate dispensation of God which will bring back all things to nothing. For “the
very heaven shall be rolled together as a scroll;”6490 nay, it shall come to nothing along with
the earth itself, with which it was made in the beginning. “Heaven and earth shall pass
away,”6491 says He. “The first heaven and the first earth passed away,”6492 “and there was
found no place for them,”6493 because, of course, that which comes to an end loses locality.
In like manner David says, “The heavens, the works of Thine hands, shall themselves perish.
For even as a vesture shall He change them, and they shall be changed.”6494 Now to be
changed is to fall from that primitive state which they lose whilst undergoing the change.
“And the stars too shall fall from heaven, even as a fig-tree casteth her green figs6495 when
she is shaken of a mighty wind.”6496 “The mountains shall melt like wax at the presence of
the Lord;”6497 that is, “when He riseth to shake terribly the earth.”6498 “But I will dry up
the pools;”6499 and “they shall seek water, and they shall find none.”6500 Even “the sea shall
be no more.”6501 Now if any person should go so far as to suppose that all these passages
ought to be spiritually interpreted, he will yet be unable to deprive them of the true accomplishment
of those issues which must come to pass just as they have been written. For all
figures of speech necessarily arise out of real things, not out of chimerical ones; because
nothing is capable of imparting anything of its own for a similitude, except it actually be
that very thing which it imparts in the similitude. I return therefore to the principle6502

For God would not have made any perishable thing out of what was eternal, that is to say,
out of Matter; neither out of greater things would He have created inferior ones, to whose
character it would be more agreeable to produce greater things out of inferior ones,—in
other words, what is eternal out of what is perishable. This is the promise He makes even
to our flesh, and it has been His will to deposit within us this pledge of His own virtue and
power, in order that we may believe that He has actually6503 awakened the universe out of
nothing, as if it had been steeped in death,6504 in the sense, of course, of its previous nonexistence

Matter and Its Qualities.</head>
<p>As regards all other points touching Matter, although there is no necessity why we
should treat of them (for our first point was the manifest proof of its existence), we must
for all that pursue our discussion just as if it did exist, in order that its non-existence may
be the more apparent, when these other points concerning it prove inconsistent with each
other, and in order at the same time that Hermogenes may acknowledge his own contradictory
positions. Matter, says he, at first sight seems to us to be incorporeal; but when examined
by the light of right reason, it is found to be neither corporeal nor incorporeal. What is this
right reason of yours,6506 which declares nothing right, that is, nothing certain? For, if I
mistake not, everything must of necessity be either corporeal or incorporeal (although I
may for the moment6507 allow that there is a certain incorporeality in even substantial
things,6508 although their very substance is the body of particular things); at all events, after
the corporeal and the incorporeal there is no third state. But if it be contended6509 that there
is a third state discovered by this right reason of Hermogenes, which makes Matter neither
corporeal nor incorporeal, (I ask,) Where is it? what sort of thing is it? what is it called? what
is its description? what is it understood to be? This only has his reason declared, that Matter
is neither corporeal nor incorporeal.</p>

<p>But see what a contradiction he next advances6510 (or perhaps some other reason6511
occurs to him), when he declares that Matter partly corporeal and partly incorporeal. Then
must Matter be considered (to embrace) both conditions, in order that it may not have
either? For it will be corporeal, and incorporeal in spite of6512 the declaration of that anti-
thesis,6513 which is plainly above giving any reason for its opinion, just as that “other reason”
also was. Now, by the corporeal part of Matter, he means that of which bodies are created;
but by the incorporeal part of Matter, he means its uncreated6514 motion. If, says he, Matter
were simply a body, there would appear to be in it nothing incorporeal, that is, (no) motion;
if, on the other hand, it had been wholly incorporeal no body could be formed out of it.
What a peculiarly right6515 reason have we here! Only if you make your sketches as right
as you make your reason, Hermogenes, no painter would be more stupid6516 than yourself.
For who is going to allow you to reckon motion as a moiety of Matter, seeing that it is not
a substantial thing, because it is not corporeal, but an accident (if indeed it be even that) of
a substance and a body? Just as action6517 is, and impulsion, just as a slip is, or a fall, so is
motion. When anything moves even of itself, its motion is the result of impulse;6518 but

nor incorporeal”). Instead, however, of the reading “reciprocationis,” Oehler would gladly read “rectæ
rationis,” after most of the editions. He thinks that this allusion to “the right reason,” of which Hermogenes
boasted, and of which the absurd conclusion is exposed in the context, very well suits the sarcastic style of Tertullian.
If this, the general reading, be adopted, we must render the whole clause this: “For it will be corporeal
and incorporeal, in spite of the declaration of that right reason (of Hermogenes), which is plainly enough above
giving any reason,” etc. etc.

certainly it is no part of its substance in your sense,6519 when you make motion the incorporeal
part of matter. All things, indeed,6520 have motion—either of themselves as animals,
or of others as inanimate things; but yet we should not say that either a man or a stone was
both corporeal and incorporeal because they had both a body and motion: we should say
rather that all things have one form of simple6521 corporeality, which is the essential quality6522
of substance. If any incorporeal incidents accrue to them, as actions, or passions, or
functions,6523 or desires, we do not reckon these parts as of the things. How then does he
contrive to assign an integral portion of Matter to motion, which does not pertain to substance,
but to a certain condition6524 of substance? Is not this incontrovertible?6525 Suppose
you had taken it into your head6526 to represent matter as immoveable, would then the
immobility seem to you to be a moiety of its form? Certainly not. Neither, in like manner,
could motion. But I shall be at liberty to speak of motion elsewhere.6527</p>

<p>I see now that you are coming back again to that reason, which has been in the habit of
declaring to you nothing in the way of certainty. For just as you introduce to our notice
Matter as being neither corporeal nor incorporeal, so you allege of it that it is neither good
nor evil; and you say, whilst arguing further on it in the same strain: “If it were good, seeing
that it had ever been so, it would not require the arrangement of itself by God;6528 if it were
naturally evil, it would not have admitted of a change6529 for the better, nor would God
have ever applied to such a nature any attempt at arrangement of it, for His labour would
have been in vain.” Such are your words, which it would have been well if you had remembered
in other passages also, so as to have avoided any contradiction of them. As,
however, we have already treated to some extent of this ambiguity of good and evil touching
Matter, I will now reply to the only proposition and argument of yours which we have before
us. I shall not stop to repeat my opinion, that it was your bounden duty to have said for
certain that Matter was either good or bad, or in some third condition; but (I must observe)
that you have not here even kept to the statement which you chose to make before. Indeed,
you retract what you declared—that Matter is neither good nor evil; because you imply that
it is evil when you say, “If it were good, it would not require to be set in order by God;” so
again, when you add, “If it were naturally evil, it would not admit of any change for the
better,” you seem to intimate6530 that it is good. And so you attribute to it a close relation6531
to good and evil, although you declared it neither good nor evil. With a view, however, to
refute the argument whereby you thought you were going to clinch your proposition, I here
contend: If Matter had always been good, why should it not have still wanted a change for
the better? Does that which is good never desire, never wish, never feel able to advance, so
as to change its good for a better? And in like manner, if Matter had been by nature evil,
why might it not have been changed by God as the more powerful Being, as able to convert
the nature of stones into children of Abraham?6532 Surely by such means you not only
compare the Lord with Matter, but you even put Him below6533 it, since you affirm that6534

the nature of Matter could not possibly be brought under control by Him, and trained to
something better. But although you are here disinclined to allow that Matter is by nature
evil, yet in another passage you will deny having made such an admission.6535</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIII.—Other Speculations of Hermogenes, About Matter and Some of
Its Adjuncts, Shown to Be Absurd. For Instance, Its Alleged Infinity.</head>
<p>My observations touching the site6536 of Matter, as also concerning its mode6537 have
one and the same object in view—to meet and refute your perverse positions. You put
Matter below God, and thus, of course, you assign a place to it below God. Therefore Matter
is local.6538 Now, if it is local, it is within locality; if within locality, it is bounded6539 by the
place within which it is; if it is bounded, it has an outline,6540 which (painter as you are in
your special vocation) you know is the boundary to every object susceptible of outline.
Matter, therefore, cannot be infinite, which, since it is in space, is bounded by space; and
being thus determinable by space, it is susceptible of an outline. You, however, make it infinite,
when you say: “It is on this account infinite, because it is always existent.” And if any
of your disciples should choose to meet us by declaring your meaning to be that Matter is
infinite in time, not in its corporeal mass,6541 still what follows will show that (you mean)
corporeal infinity to be an attribute of Matter, that it is in respect of bulk immense and uncircumscribed.
“Wherefore,” say you, “it is not fabricated as a whole, but in its parts.”6542
In bulk, therefore, is it infinite, not in time. And you contradict yourself6543 when you make
Matter infinite in bulk, and at the same time ascribe place to it, including it within space
and local outline. But yet at the same time I cannot tell why God should not have entirely
formed it,6544 unless it be because He was either impotent or envious. I want therefore to
know the moiety of that which was not wholly formed (by God), in order that I may understand
what kind of thing the entirety was. It was only right that God should have made it
known as a model of antiquity,6545 to set off the glory of His work.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIX.—These Latter Speculations Shown to Be Contradictory to the First
Principles Respecting Matter, Formerly Laid Down by Hermogenes.</head>
<p>Well, now, since it seems to you to be the correcter thing,6546 let Matter be circumscribed6547
by means of changes and displacements; let it also be capable of comprehension,
since (as you say) it is used as material by God,6548 on the ground of its being convertible,
mutable, and separable. For its changes, you say, show it to be inseparable. And here you
have swerved from your own lines6549 which you prescribed respecting the person of God
when you laid down the rule that God made it not out of His own self, because it was not
possible for Him to become divided6550 seeing that He is eternal and abiding for ever, and
therefore unchangeable and indivisible. Since Matter too is estimated by the same eternity,
having neither beginning nor end, it will be unsusceptible of division, of change, for the
same reason that God also is. Since it is associated with Him in the joint possession of
eternity, it must needs share with Him also the powers, the laws, and the conditions of
eternity. In like manner, when you say, “All things simultaneously throughout the universe6551
possess portions of it,6552 that so the whole may be ascertained from6553 its parts,”
you of course mean to indicate those parts which were produced out of it, and which are
now visible to us. How then is this possession (of Matter) by all things throughout the
universe effected—that is, of course, from the very beginning6554—when the things which
are now visible to us are different in their condition6555 from what they were in the beginning?</p>

<head>Chapter XL.—Shapeless Matter an Incongruous Origin for God’s Beautiful Cosmos.
Hermogenes Does Not Mend His Argument by Supposing that Only a Portion
of Matter Was Used in the Creation.</head>
<p>You say that Matter was reformed for the better6556—from a worse condition, of course;
and thus you would make the better a copy of the worse. Everything was in confusion, but
now it is reduced to order; and would you also say, that out of order, disorder is produced?
No one thing is the exact mirror6557 of another thing; that is to say, it is not its co-equal.
Nobody ever found himself in a barber’s looking-glass look like an ass6558 instead of a man;
unless it be he who supposes that unformed and shapeless Matter answers to Matter which
is now arranged and beautified in the fabric of the world. What is there now that is without
form in the world, what was there once that was formed6559 in Matter, that the world is the
mirror of Matter? Since the world is known among the Greeks by a term denoting ornament,
6560 how can it present the image of unadorned6561 Matter, in such a way that you
can say the whole is known by its parts? To that whole will certainly belong even the portion
which has not yet become formed; and you have already declared that the whole of Matter
was not used as material in the creation.6562 It follows, then, that this rude, and confused,
and unarranged portion cannot be recognized in the polished, and distinct and well-arranged
parts of creation, which indeed can hardly with propriety be called parts of Matter, since
they have quitted6563 its condition, by being separated from it in the transformation they
have undergone.</p>

<head>Chapter XLI.—Sundry Quotations from Hermogenes. Now Uncertain and Vague
are His Speculations Respecting Motion in Matter, and the Material Qualities
of Good and Evil.</head>
<p>I come back to the point of motion,6564 that I may show how slippery you are at every
step. Motion in Matter was disordered, and confused, and turbulent. This is why you apply
to it the comparison of a boiler of hot water surging over. Now how is it, that in another
passage another sort of motion is affirmed by you? For when you want to represent Matter
as neither good nor evil, you say: “Matter, which is the substratum (of creation)6565 possessing
as it does motion in an equable impulse,6566 tends in no very great degree either to good or
to evil.” Now if it had this equable impulse, it could not be turbulent, nor be like the boiling
water of the caldron; it would rather be even and regular, oscillating indeed of its own accord
between good and evil, but yet not prone or tending to either side. It would swing, as the
phrase is, in a just and exact balance. Now this is not unrest; this is not turbulence or inconstancy;
6567 but rather the regularity, and evenness, and exactitude of a motion, inclining to
neither side. If it oscillated this way and that way, and inclined rather to one particular side,
it would plainly in that case merit the reproach of unevenness, and inequality, and turbulence.
Moreover, although the motion of Matter was not prone either to good or to evil, it would
still, of course, oscillate between good and evil; so that from this circumstance too it is obvious
that Matter is contained within certain limits,6568 because its motion, while prone to neither
good nor evil, since it had no natural bent either way, oscillated from either between both,
and therefore was contained within the limits of the two. But you, in fact, place both good
and evil in a local habitation,6569 when you assert that motion in Matter inclined to neither
of them. For Matter which was local,6570 when inclining neither hither nor thither, inclined
not to the places in which good and evil were. But when you assign locality to good and evil,
you make them corporeal by making them local, since those things which have local space
must needs first have bodily substance. In fact,6571 incorporeal things could not have any
locality of their own except in a body, when they have access to a body.6572 But when Matter

you keep motion in Matter poised equally distant from both sides.6574</p>

<head>Chapter XLII.—Further Exposure of Inconsistencies in the Opinions of Hermogenes
Respecting the Divine Qualities of Matter.</head>
<p>You have thrown out all your views loosely and at random,6575 in order that it might
not be apparent, by too close a proximity, how contrary they are to one another. I, however,
501
mean to gather them together and compare them. You allege that motion in Matter is
without regularity,6576 and you go on to say that Matter aims at a shapeless condition, and
then, in another passage, that it desires to be set in order by God. Does that, then, which
affects to be without form, want to be put into shape? Or does that which wants to be put
into shape, affect to be without form? You are unwilling that God should seem to be equal
to Matter; and then again you say that it has a common condition6577 with God. “For it is
impossible,” you say, “if it has nothing in common with God, that it can be set in order by
Him.” But if it had anything in common with God, it did not want to be set in order,6578
being, forsooth, a part of the Deity through a community of condition; or else even God
was susceptible of being set in order6579 by Matter, by His having Himself something in
common with it. And now you herein subject God to necessity, since there was in Matter
something on account of which He gave it form. You make it, however, a common attribute
of both of them, that they set themselves in motion by themselves, and that they are ever in
motion. What less do you ascribe to Matter than to God? There will be found all through a
fellowship of divinity in this freedom and perpetuity of motion.</p>
<p>Only in God motion is regular,6580 in Matter irregular.6581 In both, however, there is
equally the attribute of Deity—both alike having free and eternal motion. At the same time,
you assign more to Matter, to which belonged the privilege of thus moving itself in a way
not allowed to God.</p>

<head>Chapter XLIII.—Other Discrepancies Exposed and Refuted Respecting the Evil in
Matter Being Changed to Good.</head>
<p>On the subject of motion I would make this further remark. Following the simile of the
boiling caldron, you say that motion in Matter, before it was regulated, was confused,6582
restless, incomprehensible by reason of excess in the commotion.6583 Then again you go
on to say, “But it waited for the regulation6584 of God, and kept its irregular motion incomprehensible,
owing to the tardiness of its irregular motion.” Just before you ascribe commotion,
here tardiness, to motion. Now observe how many slips you make respecting the nature
of Matter. In a former passage6585 you say, “If Matter were naturally evil, it would not have
admitted of a change for the better; nor would God have ever applied to it any attempt at
arrangement, for His labour would have been in vain.” You therefore concluded your two
opinions, that Matter was not by nature evil, and that its nature was incapable of being
changed by God; and then, forgetting them, you afterwards drew this inference: “But when
it received adjustment from God, and was reduced to order,6586 it relinquished its nature.”
Now, inasmuch as it was transformed to good, it was of course transformed from evil; and
if by God’s setting it in order it relinquished6587 the nature of evil, it follows that its nature
came to an end;6588 now its nature was evil before the adjustment, but after the transformation
it might have relinquished that nature.</p>

<head>Chapter XLIV.—Curious Views Respecting God’s Method of Working with Matter
Exposed. Discrepancies in the Heretic’s Opinion About God’s Local Relation to
Matter.</head>
<p>But it remains that I should show also how you make God work. You are plainly enough
at variance with the philosophers; but neither are you in accord with the prophets. The
Stoics maintain that God pervaded Matter, just as honey the honeycomb. You, however,
affirm that it is not by pervading Matter that God makes the world, but simply by appearing,
and approaching it, just as beauty affects6589 a thing by simply appearing, and a loadstone
by approaching it. Now what similarity is there in God forming the world, and beauty
wounding a soul, or a magnet attracting iron? For even if God appeared to Matter, He yet
did not wound it, as beauty does the soul; if, again, He approached it, He yet did not cohere
to it, as the magnet does to the iron. Suppose, however, that your examples are suitable ones.
Then, of course,6590 it was by appearing and approaching to Matter that God made the
world, and He made it when He appeared and when He approached to it. Therefore, since
He had not made it before then,6591 He had neither appeared nor approached to it. Now,
by whom can it be believed that God had not appeared to Matter—of the same nature as it
even was owing to its eternity? Or that He had been at a distance from it—even He whom
we believe to be existent everywhere, and everywhere apparent; whose praises all things
chant, even inanimate things and things incorporeal, according to (the prophet) Daniel?6592
How immense the place, where God kept Himself so far aloof from Matter as to have neither
appeared nor approached to it before the creation of the world! I suppose He journeyed to
it from a long distance, as soon as He wished to appear and approach to it.</p>

the Testimony of Holy Scripture Respecting the Creation. Creation Out of
Nothing, Not Out of Matter.</head>
<p>But it is not thus that the prophets and the apostles have told us that the world was made
by God merely appearing and approaching Matter. They did not even mention any Matter,
but (said) that Wisdom was first set up, the beginning of His ways, for His works.6593 Then
that the Word was produced, “through whom all things were made, and without whom
nothing was made.”6594 Indeed, “by the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all
their hosts by the breath of His mouth.”6595 He is the Lord’s right hand,6596 indeed His two
hands, by which He worked and constructed the universe. “For,” says He, “the heavens are
the works of Thine hands,”6597 wherewith “He hath meted out the heaven, and the earth
with a span.”6598 Do not be willing so to cover God with flattery, as to contend that He
produced by His mere appearance and simple approach so many vast substances, instead
of rather forming them by His own energies. For this is proved by Jeremiah when he says,
“God hath made the earth by His power, He hath established the world by His wisdom, and
hath stretched out the heaven by His understanding.”6599 These are the energies by the
stress of which He made this universe.6600 His glory is greater if He laboured. At length on
the seventh day He rested from His works. Both one and the other were after His manner.
If, on the contrary,6601 He made this world simply by appearing and approaching it, did
He, on the completion of His work, cease to appear and approach it any more. Nay rather,6602
God began to appear more conspicuously and to be everywhere accessible6603 from the time
when the world was made. You see, therefore, how all things consist by the operation of
that God who “made the earth by His power, who established the world by His wisdom,
and stretched out the heaven by His understanding;” not appearing merely, nor approaching,
but applying the almighty efforts of His mind, His wisdom, His power, His understanding,

His word, His Spirit, His might. Now these things were not necessary to Him, if He had
been perfect by simply appearing and approaching. They are, however, His “invisible things,”
which, according to the apostle, “are from the creation of the world clearly seen by the things
that are made;”6604 they are no parts of a nondescript6605 Matter, but they are the sensible6606
evidences of Himself. “For who hath known the mind of the Lord,”6607 of which (the apostle)
exclaims: “O the depth of the riches both of His wisdom and knowledge! how unsearchable
are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!”6608 Now what clearer truth do these
words indicate, than that all things were made out of nothing? They are incapable of being
found out or investigated, except by God alone. Otherwise, if they were traceable or discoverable
in Matter, they would be capable of investigation. Therefore, in as far as it has become
evident that Matter had no prior existence (even from this circumstance, that it is impossible6609
for it to have had such an existence as is assigned to it), in so far is it proved
that all things were made by God out of nothing. It must be admitted, however,6610 that
Hermogenes, by describing for Matter a condition like his own—irregular, confused, turbulent,
of a doubtful and precipate and fervid impulse—has displayed a specimen of his own
art, and painted his own portrait.</p>

may well emanate. If you propose to them inquiries sincere and honest, they answer you
with stern6627 look and contracted brow, and say, “The subject is profound.” If you try them
with subtle questions, with the ambiguities of their double tongue, they affirm a community
of faith (with yourself). If you intimate to them that you understand their opinions, they
insist on knowing nothing themselves. If you come to a close engagement with them they
destroy your own fond hope of a victory over them by a self-immolation.6628 Not even to
their own disciples do they commit a secret before they have made sure of them. They have
the knack of persuading men before instructing them; although truth persuades by teaching,
but does not teach by first persuading.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—These Heretics Brand the Christians as Simple Persons. The Charge
Accepted, and Simplicity Eulogized Out of the Scriptures.</head>
<p>For this reason we are branded6629 by them as simple, and as being merely so, without
being wise also; as if indeed wisdom were compelled to be wanting in simplicity, whereas
the Lord unites them both: “Be ye therefore wise as serpents, and simple as doves.”6630 Now
if we, on our parts, be accounted foolish because we are simple, does it then follow that they
are not simple because they are wise? Most perverse, however, are they who are not simple,
even as they are most foolish who are not wise. And yet, (if I must choose) I should prefer
taking6631 the latter condition for the lesser fault; since it is perhaps better to have a wisdom
which falls short in quantity, than that which is bad in quality6632—better to be in error
than to mislead. Besides, the face of the Lord6633 is patiently waited for by those who “seek
Him in simplicity of heart,” as says the very Wisdom—not of Valentinus, but—of Solomon.
6634 Then, again, infants have borne6635 by their blood a testimony to Christ. (Would
you say) that it was children who shouted “Crucify Him”?6636 They were neither children
nor infants; in other words, they were not simple. The apostle, too, bids us to “become
children again” towards God,6637 “to be as children in malice” by our simplicity, yet as being
also “wise in our practical faculties.”6638 At the same time, with respect to the order of development
in Wisdom, I have admitted6639 that it flows from simplicity. In brief, “the dove”
has usually served to figure Christ; “the serpent,” to tempt Him. The one even from the first
has been the harbinger of divine peace; the other from the beginning has been the despoiler
of the divine image. Accordingly, simplicity alone6640 will be more easily able to know and
to declare God, whereas wisdom alone will rather do Him violence,6641 and betray Him.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—The Folly of This Heresy. It Dissects and Mutilates the Deity. Contrasted
with the Simple Wisdom of True Religion. To Expose the Absurdities of the
Valentinian System is to Destroy It.</head>
<p>Let, then, the serpent hide himself as much as he is able, and let him wrest6642 all his
wisdom in the labyrinths of his obscurities; let him dwell deep down in the ground; let him
worm himself into secret holes; let him unroll his length through his sinuous joints;6643 let
him tortuously crawl, though not all at once,6644 beast as he is that skulks the light. Of our
dove, however, how simple is the very home!—always in high and open places, and facing
the light! As the symbol of the Holy Spirit, it loves the (radiant) East, that figure of Christ.6645
Nothing causes truth a blush, except only being hidden, because no man will be ashamed
to give ear thereto. No man will be ashamed to recognise Him as God whom nature has
already commended to him, whom he already perceives in all His works,6646—Him indeed
who is simply, for this reason, imperfectly known; because man has not thought of Him as
only one, because he has named Him in a plurality (of gods), and adored Him in other forms.
Yet,6647 to induce oneself to turn from this multitude of deities to another crowd,6648 to
remove from a familiar authority to an unknown one, to wrench oneself from what is
manifest to what is hidden, is to offend faith on the very threshold. Now, even suppose that
you are initiated into the entire fable, will it not occur to you that you have heard something
very like it from your fond nurse6649 when you were a baby, amongst the lullabies she sang
to you6650 about the towers of Lamia, and the horns of the sun?6651 Let, however, any man

the Man, whose name is the Branch”), are rendered in the Vulgate, “Ecce Vir Oriens nomen ejus.” Similarly in
Zech. iii. 8, “Servum meum adducam Orientem.” (Compare Luke i. 78, where the ᾽Ανατολὴ ἐξ ὕψ·ους (“the dayspring

hesitate at once to pronounce that these are “the fables and endless genealogies” which the
inspired apostle6652 by anticipation condemned, whilst these seeds of heresy were even then
shooting forth? Deservedly, therefore, must they be regarded as wanting in simplicity, and
as merely prudent, who produce such fables not without difficulty, and defend them only
indirectly, who at the same time do not thoroughly instruct those whom they teach. This,
of course, shows their astuteness, if their lessons are disgraceful; their unkindness, if they
are honourable. As for us, however, who are the simple folk, we know all about it. In short,
this is the very first weapon with which we are armed for our encounter; it unmasks6653
and brings to view6654 the whole of their depraved system.6655 And in this we have the first
augury of our victory; because even merely to point out that which is concealed with so

<head>Chapter IV.—The Heresy Traceable to Valentinus, an Able But Restless Man. Many
Schismatical Leaders of the School Mentioned. Only One of Them Shows Respect
to the Man Whose Name Designates the Entire School.</head>
<p>We know, I say, most fully their actual origin, and we are quite aware why we call them
Valentinians, although they affect to disavow their name. They have departed, it is true,6657
from their founder, yet is their origin by no means destroyed; and even if it chance to be
changed, the very change bears testimony to the fact. Valentinus had expected to become
a bishop, because he was an able man both in genius and eloquence. Being indignant,
however, that another obtained the dignity by reason of a claim which confessorship6658
had given him, he broke with the church of the true faith. Just like those (restless) spirits
which, when roused by ambition, are usually inflamed with the desire of revenge, he applied
himself with all his might6659 to exterminate the truth; and finding the clue6660 of a certain
old opinion, he marked out a path for himself with the subtlety of a serpent. Ptolemæus afterwards
entered on the same path, by distinguishing the names and the numbers of the
Ænons into personal substances, which, however, he kept apart from God. Valentinus had
included these in the very essence of the Deity, as senses and affections of motion. Sundry
bypaths were then struck off therefrom, by Heraclean and Secundus and the magician
Marcus. Theotimus worked hard about “the images of the law.” Valentinus, however, was
as yet nowhere, and still the Valentinians derive their name from Valentinus. Axionicus at
Antioch is the only man who at the present time does honour6661 to the memory of
Valentinus, by keeping his rules6662 to the full. But this heresy is permitted to fashion itself
into as many various shapes as a courtezan, who usually changes and adjusts her dress every
day. And why not? When they review that spiritual seed of theirs in every man after this
fashion, whenever they have hit upon any novelty, they forthwith call their presumption a
revelation, their own perverse ingenuity a spiritual gift; but (they deny all) unity, admitting
only diversity.6663 And thus we clearly see that, setting aside their customary dissimulation,
most of them are in a divided state, being ready to say (and that sincerely) of certain points
of their belief, “This is not so;” and, “I take this in a different sense;” and, “I do not admit

<p>My own path, however, lies along the original tenets6665 of their chief teachers, not with
the self-appointed leaders of their promiscuous6666 followers. Nor shall we hear it said of
us from any quarter, that we have of our own mind fashioned our own materials, since these
have been already produced, both in respect of the opinions and their refutations, in carefully
written volumes, by so many eminently holy and excellent men, not only those who have
lived before us, but those also who were contemporary with the heresiarchs themselves: for
instance Justin, philosopher and martyr;6667 Miltiades, the sophist6668 of the churches;
Irenæus, that very exact inquirer into all doctrines;6669 our own Proculus, the model6670 of
chaste old age and Christian eloquence. All these it would be my desire closely to follow in
every work of faith, even as in this particular one. Now if there are no heresies at all but
what those who refute them are supposed to have fabricated, then the apostle who predicted
them6671 must have been guilty of falsehood. If, however, there are heresies, they can be no
other than those which are the subject of discussion. No writer can be supposed to have so
much time on his hands6672 as to fabricate materials which are already in his possession.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—Although Writing in Latin He Proposes to Retain the Greek Names
of the Valentinian Emanations of Deity. Not to Discuss the Heresy But Only to
Expose It. This with the Raillery Which Its Absurdity Merits.</head>
<p>In order then, that no one may be blinded by so many outlandish6673 names, collected
together, and adjusted at pleasure,6674 and of doubtful import, I mean in this little work,
wherein we merely undertake to propound this (heretical) mystery, to explain in what
manner we are to use them. Now the rendering of some of these names from the Greek so
as to produce an equally obvious sense of the word, is by no means an easy process: in the
case of some others, the genders are not suitable; while others, again, are more familiarly
known in their Greek form. For the most part, therefore, we shall use the Greek names; their
meanings will be seen on the margins of the pages. Nor will the Greek be unaccompanied
with the Latin equivalents; only these will be marked in lines above, for the purpose of explaining6675
the personal names, rendered necessary by the ambiguities of such of them as
admit some different meaning. But although I must postpone all discussion, and be content
at present with the mere exposition (of the heresy), still, wherever any scandalous feature
shall seem to require a castigation, it must be attacked6676 by all means, if only with a passing
thrust.6677 Let the reader regard it as the skirmish before the battle. It will be my drift to
show how to wound6678 rather than to inflict deep gashes. If in any instance mirth be excited,
this will be quite as much as the subject deserves. There are many things which deserve refutation
in such a way as to have no gravity expended on them. Vain and silly topics are
met with especial fitness by laughter. Even the truth may indulge in ridicule, because it is
jubilant; it may play with its enemies, because it is fearless.6679 Only we must take care that
its laughter be not unseemly, and so itself be laughed at; but wherever its mirth is decent,
there it is a duty to indulge it. And so at last I enter on my task.</p>

<p>Beginning with Ennius,6680 the Roman poet, he simply spoke of “the spacious saloons6681
of heaven,”—either on account of their elevated site, or because in Homer he had read about
Jupiter banqueting therein. As for our heretics, however, it is marvellous what storeys upon
storeys6682 and what heights upon heights, they have hung up, raised and spread out as a
dwelling for each several god of theirs. Even our Creator has had arranged for Him the saloons
of Ennius in the fashion of private rooms,6683 with chamber piled upon chamber, and
assigned to each god by just as many staircases as there were heresies. The universe, in fact,
has been turned into “rooms to let.”6684 Such storeys of the heavens you would imagine to
be detached tenements in some happy isle of the blessed,6685 I know not where. There the
god even of the Valentinians has his dwelling in the attics. They call him indeed, as to his
essence, Αἰῶν τέλειος (Perfect Æon), but in respect of his personality, Προαρχή (Before the
Beginning), ῾Η ᾽Αρχή (The Beginning), and sometimes Bythos (Depth),6686 a name which is
most unfit for one who dwells in the heights above! They describe him as unbegotten, immense,
infinite, invisible, and eternal; as if, when they described him to be such as we know
that he ought to be, they straightway prove him to be a being who may be said to have had
such an existence even before all things else. I indeed insist upon6687 it that he is such a being;
and there is nothing which I detect in beings of this sort more obvious, than that they who
are said to have been before all things—things, too, not their own—are found to be behind
all things. Let it, however, be granted that this Bythos of theirs existed in the infinite ages
of the past in the greatest and profoundest repose, in the extreme rest of a placid and, if I
may use the expression, stupid divinity, such as Epicurus has enjoined upon us. And yet,
although they would have him be alone, they assign to him a second person in himself and
with himself, Ennoea (Thought), which they also call both Charis (Grace) and Sige (Silence).

Other things, as it happened, conduced in this most agreeable repose to remind him of the
need of by and by producing out of himself the beginning of all things. This he deposits in
lieu of seed in the genital region, as it were, of the womb of his Sige. Instantaneous conception
is the result: Sige becomes pregnant, and is delivered, of course in silence; and her offspring
is Nus (Mind), very like his father and his equal in every respect. In short, he alone is capable
of comprehending the measureless and incomprehensible greatness of his father. Accordingly
he is even called the Father himself, and the Beginning of all things, and, with great propriety,
Monogenes (The Only-begotten). And yet not with absolute propriety, since he is not born
alone. For along with him a female also proceeded, whose name was Veritas6688 (Truth).
But how much more suitably might Monogenes be called Protogenes (First begotten), since
he was begotten first! Thus Bythos and Sige, Nus and Veritas, are alleged to be the first
fourfold team6689 of the Valentinian set (of gods)6690 the parent stock and origin of them
all. For immediately when6691 Nus received the function of a procreation of his own, he
too produces out of himself Sermo (the Word) and Vita (the Life). If this latter existed not
previously, of course she existed not in Bythos. And a pretty absurdity would it be, if Life
existed not in God! However, this offspring also produces fruit, having for its mission the
initiation of the universe and the formation of the entire Pleroma: it procreates Homo (Man)
and Ecclesia (the Church). Thus you have an Ogdoad, a double Tetra, out of the conjunctions
of males and females—the cells6692 (so to speak) of the primordial Æons, the fraternal
nuptials of the Valentinian gods, the simple originals6693 of heretical sanctity and majesty,
a rabble6694—shall I say of criminals6695 or of deities?6696—at any rate, the fountain of all

Two More, and Ultimately a Dozen Besides. These Thirty Constitute the Pleroma.
But Why Be So Capricious as to Stop at Thirty?</head>
<p>For, behold, when the second Tetrad—Sermo and Vita, Homo and Ecclesia6697—had
borne fruit to the Father’s glory, having an intense desire of themselves to present to the
Father something similar of their own, they bring other issue into being6698—conjugal of
course, as the others were6699—by the union of the twofold nature. On the one hand, Sermo
and Vita pour out at a birth a half-score of Æons; on the other hand, Homo and Ecclesia
produce a couple more, so furnishing an equipoise to their parents, since this pair with the
other ten make up just as many as they did themselves procreate. I now give the names of
the half-score whom I have mentioned: Bythios (Profound) and Mixis (Mixture), Ageratos
(Never old) and Henosis (Union), Autophyes (Essential nature) and Hedone (Pleasure),
Acinetos (Immoveable) and Syncrasis (Commixture,) Monogenes (Only-begotten) and Macaria
(Happiness). On the other hand, these will make up the number twelve (to which I
have also referred): Paracletus (Comforter) and Pistis (Faith), Patricas (Paternal) and Elpis
(Hope), Metricos (Maternal) and Agape (Love), Ainos (Praise)6700 and Synesis (Intelligence),
Ecclesiasticus (Son of Ecclesia) and Macariotes (Blessedness), Theletus6701 (Perfect) and
Sophia (Wisdom). I cannot help6702 here quoting from a like example what may serve to
show the import of these names. In the schools of Carthage there was once a certain Latin
rhetorician, an excessively cool fellow,6703 whose name was Phosphorus. He was personating
a man of valour, and wound up6704 with saying, “I come to you, excellent citizens, from
battle, with victory for myself, with happiness for you, full of honour, covered with glory,
the favourite of fortune, the greatest of men, decked with triumph.” And forthwith his
scholars begin to shout for the school of Phosphorus, φεῦ6705 (ah!). Are you a believer

Grand Titles Borne by This Last Power.</head>
<p>But, further, there is an “acceptance6713 of persons,” inasmuch as Nus alone among
them all enjoys the knowledge of the immeasurable Father, joyous and exulting, while they
of course pine in sorrow. To be sure, Nus, so far as in him lay, both wished and tried to
impart to the others also all that he had learnt about the greatness and incomprehensibility
of the Father; but his mother, Sige, interposed—she who (you must know) imposes silence
even on her own beloved heretics;6714 although they affirm that this is done at the will of
the Father, who will have all to be inflamed with a longing after himself. Thus, while they
are tormenting themselves with these internal desires, while they are burning with the secret
longing to know the Father, the crime is almost accomplished. For of the twelve Æons which
Homo and Ecclesia had produced, the youngest by birth (never mind the solecism, since
Sophia (Wisdom) is her name), unable to restrain herself, breaks away without the society
of her husband Theletus, in quest of the Father and contracts that kind of sin which had
indeed arisen amongst the others who were conversant with Nus but had flowed on to this
Æon,6715 that is, to Sophia; as is usual with maladies which, after arising in one part of the
body, spread abroad their infection to some other limb. The fact is,6716 under a pretence of
love to the Father, she was overcome with a desire to rival Nus, who alone rejoiced in the
knowledge of the Father.6717 But when Sophia, straining after impossible aims, was disappointed
of her hope, she is both overcome with difficulty, and racked with affection. Thus
she was all but swallowed up by reason of the charm and toil (of her research),6718 and dissolved
into the remnant of his substance;6719 nor would there have been any other alternative
for her than perdition, if she had not by good luck fallen in with Horus (Limit). He too had
considerable power. He is the foundation of the great6720 universe, and, externally, the

<head>Chapter X.—Another Account of the Strange Aberrations of Sophia, and the Restraining
Services of Horus. Sophia Was Not Herself, After All, Ejected from
the Pleroma, But Only Her Enthymesis.</head>
<p>But some dreamers have given another account of the aberration6723 and recovery of
Sophia. After her vain endeavours, and the disappointment of her hope, she was, I suppose,
disfigured with paleness and emaciation, and that neglect of her beauty which was natural
to one who6724 was deploring the denial of the Father,—an affliction which was no less
painful than his loss. Then, in the midst of all this sorrow, she by herself alone, without any
conjugal help, conceived and bare a female offspring. Does this excite your surprise? Well,
even the hen has the power of being able to bring forth by her own energy.6725 They say,
too, that among vultures there are only females, which become parents alone. At any rate,
she was another without aid from a male, and she began at last to be afraid that her end was
even at hand. She was all in doubt about the treatment6726 of her case, and took pains at
self-concealment. Remedies could nowhere be found. For where, then, should we have tragedies
and comedies, from which to borrow the process of exposing what has been born
without connubial modesty? While the thing is in this evil plight, she raises her eyes, and
turns them to the Father. Having, however, striven in vain, as her strength was failing her,
she falls to praying. Her entire kindred also supplicates in her behalf, and especially Nus.
Why not? What was the cause of so vast an evil? Yet not a single casualty6727 befell Sophia
without its effect. All her sorrows operate. Inasmuch as all that conflict of hers contributes
to the origin of Matter. Her ignorance, her fear, her distress, become substances. Hereupon
the Father by and by, being moved, produces in his own image, with a view to these circumstances6728
the Horos whom we have mentioned above; (and this he does) by means of
Monogenes Nus, a male-female (Æon), because there is this variation of statement about
the Father’s6729 sex. They also go on to tell us that Horos is likewise called Metagogius, that
is, “a conductor about,” as well as Horothetes (Setter of Limits). By his assistance they declare
that Sophia was checked in her illicit courses, and purified from all evils, and henceforth
strengthened (in virtue), and restored to the conjugal state: (they add) that she indeed re-

<head>Chapter XI.—The Profane Account Given of the Origin of Christ and the Holy Ghost
Sternly Rebuked. An Absurdity Respecting the Attainment of the Knowledge of
God Ably Exposed.</head>
<p>Accordingly, after the banishment of the Enthymesis, and the return of her mother
Sophia to her husband, the (illustrious) Monogenes, the Nus,6733 released indeed from all
care and concern of the Father, in order that he might consolidate all things, and defend
and at last fix the Pleroma, and so prevent any concussion of the kind again, once more6734
emits a new couple6735 (blasphemously named). I should suppose the coupling of two males
to be a very shameful thing, or else the one6736 must be a female, and so the male is discredited6737
by the female. One divinity is assigned in the case of all these, to procure a complete
adjustment among the Æons. Even from this fellowship in a common duty two schools actually
arise, two chairs,6738 and, to some extent,6739 the inauguration of a division in the
doctrine of Valentinus. It was the function of Christ to instruct the Æons in the nature of
their conjugal relations6740 (you see what the whole thing was, of course!), and how to form
some guess about the unbegotten,6741 and to give them the capacity of generating within
themselves the knowledge of the Father; it being impossible to catch the idea of him, or
comprehend him, or, in short, even to enjoy any perception of him, either by the eye or the
ear, except through Monogenes (the Only-begotten). Well, I will even grant them what they
allege about knowing the Father, so that they do not refuse us (the attainment of) the same.
I would rather point out what is perverse in their doctrine, how they were taught that the
incomprehensible part of the Father was the cause of their own perpetuity,6742 whilst that
which might be comprehended of him was the reason6743 of their generation and formation.
Now by these several positions6744 the tenet, I suppose, is insinuated, that it is expedient
for God not to be apprehended, on the very ground that the incomprehensibility of His

Members Thereof. Their Joint Contribution of Parts Set Forth with Humorous
Irony.</head>
<p>Thus they are all on the self-same footing in respect of form and knowledge, all of them
having become what each of them severally is; none being a different being, because they
are all what the others are.6745 They are all turned into6746 Nuses, into Homos, into Theletuses;
6747 and so in the case of the females, into Siges, into Zoes, into Ecclesias, into Fortunatas,
so that Ovid would have blotted out his own Metamorphoses if he had only known
our larger one in the present day. Straightway they were reformed and thoroughly established,
and being composed to rest from the truth, they celebrate the Father in a chorus6748
of praise in the exuberance of their joy. The Father himself also revelled6749 in the glad
feeling; of course, because his children and grandchildren sang so well. And why should he
not revel in absolute delight? Was not the Pleroma freed (from all danger)? What ship’s
captain6750 fails to rejoice even with indecent frolic? Every day we observe the uproarious
ebullitions of sailors’ joys.6751 Therefore, as sailors always exult over the reckoning they pay
in common, so do these Æons enjoy a similar pleasure, one as they now all are in form, and,
as I may add,6752 in feeling too. With the concurrence of even their new brethren and
masters,6753 they contribute into one common stock the best and most beautiful thing with
which they are severally adorned. Vainly, as I suppose. For if they were all one by reason
by the above-mentioned thorough equalization, there was no room for the process of a
common reckoning,6754 which for the most part consists of a pleasing variety. They all
contributed the one good thing, which they all were. There would be, in all probability, a
formal procedure6755 in the mode or in the form of the very equalization in question. Ac-

external honour also to their wonderful puppet, they produce for him a bodyguard of angels
of like nature. If this be their mutual condition, it may be all right; if, however, they are

<p>In this series, then, is contained the first emanation of Æons, who are alike born, and
are married, and produce offspring: there are the most dangerous fortunes of Sophia in her
ardent longing for the Father, the most seasonable help of Horos, the expiation of her Enthymesis
and accruing Passion, the instruction of Christ and the Holy Spirit, their tutelar
reform of the Æons, the piebald ornamentation of Soter, the consubstantial retinue6763 of
the angels. All that remains, according to you, is the fall of the curtain and the clapping of
hands.6764 What remains in my opinion, however, is, that you should hear and take heed.
At all events, these things are said to have been played out within the company of the Pleroma,
the first scene of the tragedy. The rest of the play, however, is beyond the curtain—I mean
outside of the Pleroma. And yet if it be such within the bosom of the Father, within the
embrace of the guardian Horos, what must it be outside, in free space,6765 where God did
not exist?</p>

Christ in Pursuit of Her. Her Longing for Christ. Horos’ Hostility to Her. Her
Continued Suffering.</head>
<p>For Enthymesis, or rather Achamoth—because by this inexplicable6766 name alone
must she be henceforth designated—when in company with the vicious Passion, her inseparable
companion, she was expelled to places devoid of that light which is the substance of
the Pleroma, even to the void and empty region of Epicurus, she becomes wretched also
because of the place of her banishment. She is indeed without either form or feature, even
an untimely and abortive production. Whilst she is in this plight,6767 Christ descends
from6768 the heights, conducted by Horos, in order to impart form to the abortion, out of
his own energies, the form of substance only, but not of knowledge also. Still she is left with
some property. She has restored to her the odour of immortality, in order that she might,
under its influence, be overcome with the desire of better things than belonged to her present
plight.6769 Having accomplished His merciful mission, not without the assistance of the
Holy Spirit, Christ returns to the Pleroma. It is usual out of an abundance of things6770 for
names to be also forthcoming. Enthymesis came from action;6771 whence Achamoth came
is still a question; Sophia emanates from the Father, the Holy Spirit from an angel. She entertains
a regret for Christ immediately after she had discovered her desertion by him.
Therefore she hurried forth herself, in quest of the light of Him Whom she did not at all
discover, as He operated in an invisible manner; for how else would she make search for
His light, which was as unknown to her as He was Himself? Try, however, she did, and
perhaps would have found Him, had not the self-same Horos, who had met her mother so
opportunely, fallen in with the daughter quite as unseasonably, so as to exclaim at her Iao!
just as we hear the cry “Porro Quirites” (“Out of the way, Romans!”), or else Fidem Cæsaris!”
(“By the faith of Cæsar!”), whence (as they will have it) the name Iao comes to be found is

of Achamoth. The Waters from Her Tears; Light from Her Smile.</head>
<p>Well, now, the Pythagoreans may learn, the Stoics may know, Plato himself (may discover),
whence Matter, which they will have to be unborn, derived both its origin and substance
for all this pile of the world—(a mystery) which not even the renowned6776 Mercurius
Trismegistus, master (as he was) of all physical philosophy, thought out.6777 You have just
heard of “Conversion,” one element in the “Passion” (we have so often mentioned). Out of
this the whole life of the world,6778 and even that of the Demiurge himself, our God, is said
to have had its being. Again, you have heard of “sorrow” and “fear.” From these all other
created things6779 took their beginning. For from her6780 tears flowed the entire mass of
waters. From this circumstance one may form an idea of the calamity6781 which she encountered,
so vast were the kinds of the tears wherewith she overflowed. She had salt teardrops,
she had bitter, and sweet, and warm, and cold, and bituminous, and ferruginous, and
sulphurous, and even6782 poisonous, so that the Nonacris exuded therefrom which killed
Alexander; and the river of the Lyncestæ6783 flowed from the same source, which produces
drunkenness; and the Salmacis6784 was derived from the same source, which renders men
effeminate. The rains of heaven Achamoth whimpered forth,6785 and we on our part are
anxiously employed in saving up in our cisterns the very wails and tears of another. In like
manner, from the “consternation” and “alarm” (of which we have also heard), bodily elements
were derived. And yet amidst so many circumstances of solitude, in this vast prospect of
destitution, she occasionally smiled at the recollection of the sight of Christ, and from this
smile of joy light flashed forth. How great was this beneficence of Providence, which induced
her to smile, and all that we might not linger for ever in the dark! Nor need you feel aston-

<p>She, too, resorts to prayers, after the manner of her mother. But Christ, Who now felt
a dislike to quit the Pleroma, appoints the Paraclete as his deputy. To her, therefore, he
despatches Soter,6790 (who must be the same as Jesus, to whom the Father imparted the
supreme power over the whole body of the Æons, by subjecting them all to him, so that “by
him,” as the apostle says, “all things were created”6791), with a retinue and cortege of contemporary
angels, and (as one may suppose) with the dozen fasces. Hereupon Achamoth,
being quite struck with the pomp of his approach, immediately covered herself with a veil,
moved at first with a dutiful feeling of veneration and modesty; but afterwards she surveys
him calmly, and his prolific equipage.6792 With such energies as she had derived from the
contemplation, she meets him with the salutation, Κύριε, χαῖρε (“Hail, Lord”)! Upon this,
I suppose, he receives her, confirms and conforms her in knowledge, as well as cleanses6793
her from all the outrages of Passion, without, however, utterly severing them, with an indiscriminateness
like that which had happened in the casualties which befell her mother. For
such vices as had become inveterate and confirmed by practice he throws together; and
when he had consolidated them in one mass, he fixes them in a separate body, so as to
compose the corporeal condition of Matter, extracting out of her inherent, incorporeal
passion such an aptitude of nature6794 as might qualify it to attain to a reciprocity of bodily
substances,6795 which should emulate one another, so that a twofold condition of the substances
might be arranged; one full of evil through its faults, the other susceptible of passion
from conversion. This will prove to be Matter, which has set us in battle array against
Hermogenes, and all others who presume to teach that God made all things out of Matter,
not out of nothing.</p>

and bears fruit with greater results. For warmed with the joy of so great an escape from her
unhappy condition, and at the same time heated with the actual contemplation of the angelic
luminaries (one is ashamed) to use such language, (but there is no other way of expressing
one’s meaning), she during the emotion somehow became personally inflamed with desire6797
towards them, and at once grew pregnant with a spiritual conception, at the very image of
which the violence of her joyous transport, and the delight of her prurient excitement had
imbibed and impressed upon her. She at length gave birth to an offspring, and then there
arose a leash of natures,6798 from a triad of causes,—one material, arising from her passion;
another animal, arising from her conversion; the third spiritual, which had its origin in her
imagination.</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Blasphemous Opinion Concerning the Origin of the Demiurge,
Supposed to Be the Creator of the Universe.</head>
<p>Having become a better proficient6799 in practical conduct by the authority which, we
may well suppose,6800 accrued to her from her three children, she determined to impart
form to each of the natures. The spiritual one however, she was unable to touch, inasmuch
as she was herself spiritual. For a participation in the same nature has, to a very great extent,
6801 disqualified like and consubstantial beings from having superior power over one
another. Therefore6802 she applies herself solely to the animal nature, adducing the instructions
of Soter6803 (for her guidance). And first of all (she does) what cannot be described
and read, and heard of, without an intense horror at the blasphemy thereof: she produces
this God of ours, the God of all except of the heretics, the Father and Creator6804 and King
of all things, which are inferior to him. For from him do they proceed. If, however, they
proceed from him, and not rather from Achamoth, or if only secretly from her, without his
perceiving her, he was impelled to all that he did, even like a puppet6805 which is moved
from the outside. In fact, it was owing to this very ambiguity about the personal agency in
the works which were done, that they coined for him the mixed name of (Motherly Father),
6806 whilst his other appellations were distinctly assigned according to the conditions
and positions of his works: so that they call him Father in relation to the animal substances
to which they give the place of honour6807 on his right hand; whereas, in respect of the
material substances which they banish6808 to his left hand, they name him Demiurgus; whilst
his title King designates his authority over both classes, nay over the universe.6809</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—Palpable Absurdities and Contradictions in the System Respecting
Achamoth and the Demiurge.</head>
<p>And yet there is not any agreement between the propriety of the names and that of the
works, from which all the names are suggested; since all of them ought to have borne the
name of her by whom the things were done, unless after all6810 it turn out that they were
not made by her. For, although they say that Achamoth devised these forms in honour of
the Æons, they yet6811 transfer this work to Soter as its author, when they say that he6812
operated through her, so far as to give her the very image of the invisible and unknown
Father—that is, the image which was unknown and invisible to the Demiurge; whilst he6813
formed this same Demiurge in imitation6814 of Nus the son of Propator;6815 and whilst the
archangels, who were the work of the Demiurge, resembled the other Æons. Now, when I
hear of such images of the three, I ask, do you not wish me to laugh at these pictures of their
most extravagant painter? At the female Achamoth, a picture of the Father? At the Demiurge,
ignorant of his mother, much more so of his father? At the picture of Nus, ignorant of his
father too, and the ministering angels, facsimiles of their lords? This is painting a mule from
an ass, and sketching Ptolemy from Valentinus.</p>

<head>Chapter XX—The Demiurge Works Away at Creation, as the Drudge of His Mother
Achamoth, in Ignorance All the While of the Nature of His Occupation.</head>
<p>The Demiurge therefore, placed as he was without the limits of the Pleroma in the igno-
minious solitude of his eternal exile, founded a new empire—this world (of ours)—by clear
ing away the confusion and distinguishing the difference between the two substances which
severally constituted it,6816 the animal and the material. Out of incorporeal (elements) he
constructs bodies, heavy, light, erect6817 and stooping, celestial and terrene. He then completes
the sevenfold stages of heaven itself, with his own throne above all. Whence he had
the additional name of Sabbatum from the hebdomadal nature of his abode; his mother
Achamoth, too, had the title Ogdoada, after the precedent of the primeval Ogdoad.6818
These heavens, however, they consider to be intelligent,6819 and sometimes they make angels
of them, as indeed they do of the Demiurge himself; as also (they call) Paradise the fourth
archangel, because they fix it above the third heaven, of the power of which Adam partook,
when he sojourned there amidst its fleecy clouds6820 and shrubs.6821 Ptolemy remembered
perfectly well the prattle of his boyhood,6822 that apples grew in the sea, and fishes on the
tree; after the same fashion, he assumed that nut-trees flourished in the skies. The Demiurge
does his work in ignorance, and therefore perhaps he is unaware that trees ought to be
planted only on the ground. His mother, of course, knew all about it: how is it, then, that
she did not suggest the fact, since she was actually executing her own operation? But whilst
building up so vast an edifice for her son by means of those works, which proclaim him at
once to be father, god and, king before the conceits of the Valentinians, why she refused to
let them be known to even him,6823 is a question which I shall ask afterwards.</p>

even Holy Spirit. In this way they have conferred all honour on that female, I suppose even
a beard, not to say other things. Besides,6825 the Demiurge had so little mastery over
things,6826 on the score,6827 you must know,6828 of his inability to approach spiritual essences,
(constituted as he was) of animal elements, that, imagining himself to be the only
being, he uttered this soliloquy: “I am God, and beside me there is none else.”6829 But for
all that, he at least was aware that he had not himself existed before. He understood, therefore,
that he had been created, and that there must be a creator of a creature of some sort or
other. How happens it, then, that he seemed to himself to be the only being, notwithstanding
his uncertainty, and although he had, at any rate, some suspicion of the existence of some
creator?</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—The Relative Positions of the Pleroma. The Region of Achamoth,
and the Creation of the Demiurge. The Addition of Fire to the Various Elements
and Bodies of Nature.</head>
<p>Their most eminent powers, moreover, they confine within the following limits, as in
a citadel. In the most elevated of all summits presides the tricenary Pleroma,6836 Horos
marking off its boundary line. Beneath it, Achamoth occupies the intermediate space for
her abode,6837 treading down her son. For under her comes the Demiurge in his own Hebdomad,
or rather the Devil, sojourning in this world in common with ourselves, formed, as
has been said above, of the same elements and the same body, out of the most profitable
calamities of Sophia; inasmuch as, (if it had not been for these,) our spirit would have had
no space for inhaling and ejecting6838 air—that delicate vest of all corporeal creatures, that
revealer of all colours, that instrument of the seasons—if the sadness of Sophia had not
filtered it, just as her fear did the animal existence, and her conversion the Demiurge himself.
Into all these elements and bodies fire was fanned. Now, since they have not as yet explained
to us the original sensation of this6839 in Sophia, I will on my own responsibility6840 conjecture
that its spark was struck out of the delicate emotions6841 of her (feverish grief). For you
may be quite sure that, amidst all her vexations, she must have had a good deal of fever.6842</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—The Formation of Man by the Demiurge. Human Flesh Not Made
of the Ground, But of a Nondescript Philosophic Substance.</head>
<p>Such being their conceits respecting God, or, if you like,6843 the gods, of what sort are
their figments concerning man? For, after he had made the world, the Demiurge turns his
hands to man, and chooses for him as his substance not any portion of “the dry land,” as
they say, of which alone we have any knowledge (although it was, at that time, not yet dried
by the waters becoming separated from the earthy residuum, and only afterwards became
dry), but of the invisible substance of that matter, which philosophy indeed dreams of, from
its fluid and fusible composition, the origin of which I am unable to imagine, because it exists
nowhere. Now, since fluidity and fusibility are qualities of liquid matter, and since everything
liquid flowed from Sophia’s tears, we must, as a necessary conclusion, believe that muddy
earth is constituted of Sophia’s eye-rheums and viscid discharges,6844 which are just as much
the dregs of tears as mud is the sediment of waters. Thus does the Demiurge mould man as
a potter does his clay, and animates him with his own breath. Made after his image and
likeness, he will therefore be both material and animal. A fourfold being! For in respect of
his “image,” he must be deemed clayey,6845 that is to say, material, although the Demiurge
is not composed of matter; but as to his “likeness,” he is animal, for such, too, is the Demiurge.
You have two (of his constituent elements). Moreover, a coating of flesh was, as they allege,
afterwards placed over the clayey substratum, and it is this tunic of skin which is susceptible
of sensation.</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—An Extravagant Way of Accounting for the Communication of the
Spiritual Nature to Man. It Was Furtively Managed by Achamoth, Through the
Unconscious Agency of Her Son.</head>
<p>In Achamoth, moreover, there was inherent a certain property of a spiritual germ, of
her mother Sophia’s substance; and Achamoth herself had carefully severed off (the same
quality), and implanted it in her son the Demiurge, although he was actually unconscious
of it. It is for you to imagine6846 the industry of this clandestine arrangement. For to this
end had she deposited and concealed (this germ), that, whenever the Demiurge came to
impart life to Adam by his inbreathing, he might at the same time draw off from the vital
principle6847 the spiritual seed, and, as by a pipe, inject it into the clayey nature; in order
that, being then fecundated in the material body as in a womb, and having fully grown there,
it might be found fit for one day receiving the perfect Word.6848 When, therefore, the
Demiurge commits to Adam the transmission of his own vital principle,6849 the spiritual
man lay hid, although inserted by his breath, and at the same time introduced into the body,
because the Demiurge knew no more about his mother’s seed than about herself. To this
seed they give the name of Ecclesia (the Church), the mirror of the church above, and the
perfection6850 of man; tracing this perfection from Achamoth, just as they do the animal
nature from the Demiurge, the clayey material of the body (they derive) from the primordial
substance,6851 the flesh from Matter. So that you have a new Geryon here, only a fourfold
(rather than a threefold) monster.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—The Three Several Natures—The Material, the Animal, and the
Spiritual, and Their Several Destinations. The Strange Valentinian Opinion
About the Structure of Soter’s Nature.</head>
<p>In like manner they assign to each of them a separate end.6852 To the material, that is
to say the carnal (nature), which they also call “the left-handed,” they assign undoubted
destruction; to the animal (nature), which they also call “the right-handed,” a doubtful issue,
inasmuch as it oscillates between the material and the spiritual, and is sure to fall at last on
the side to which it has mainly gravitated. As regards the spiritual, however, (they say) that
it enters into the formation of the animal, in order that it may be educated in company with
it and be disciplined by repeated intercourse with it. For the animal (nature) was in want
of training even by the senses: for this purpose, accordingly, was the whole structure of the
world provided; for this purpose also did Soter (the Saviour) present Himself in the
world—even for the salvation of the animal (nature). By yet another arrangement they will
have it that He, in some prodigious way,6853 clothed Himself with the primary portions6854
of those substances, the whole of which He was going to restore to salvation; in such wise
that He assumed the spiritual nature from Achamoth, whilst He derived the animal (being),
Christ, afterwards from the Demiurge; His corporal substance, however, which was constructed
of an animal nature (only with wonderful and indescribable skill), He wore for a dispensational
purpose, in order that He might, in spite of His own unwillingness,6855 be capable
of meeting persons, and of being seen and touched by them, and even of dying. But there
was nothing material assumed by Him, inasmuch as that was incapable of salvation. As if
He could possibly have been more required by any others than by those who were in want
of salvation! And all this, in order that by severing the condition of our flesh from Christ
they may also deprive it of the hope of salvation!</p>

Not of Her. He Found in Her, Not a Mother, But Only a Passage or Channel.
Jesus Descended Upon Christ, at His Baptism, Like a Dove; But, Being Incapable
of Suffering, He Left Christ to Die on the Cross Alone.</head>
<p>I now adduce6856 (what they say) concerning Christ, upon whom some of them engraft
Jesus with so much licence, that they foist into Him a spiritual seed together with an animal
inflatus. Indeed, I will not undertake to describe6857 these incongruous crammings,6858
which they have contrived in relation both to their men and their gods. Even the Demiurge
has a Christ of His own—His natural Son. An animal, in short, produced by Himself, proclaimed
by the prophets—His position being one which must be decided by prepositions;
in other words, He was produced by means of a virgin, rather than of a virgin! On the ground
that, having descended into the virgin rather in the manner of a passage through her than
of a birth by her, He came into existence through her, not of her—not experiencing a
mother in her, but nothing more than a way. Upon this same Christ, therefore (so they say),
Jesus descended in the sacrament of baptism, in the likeness of a dove. Moreover, there was
even in Christ accruing from Achamoth the condiment of a spiritual seed, in order of course
to prevent the corruption of all the other stuffing.6859 For after the precedent of the principal
Tetrad, they guard him with four substances—the spiritual one of Achamoth, the animal
one of the Demiurge, the corporeal one, which cannot be described, and that of Soter, or,
in other phrase, the columbine.6860 As for Soter (Jesus), he remained in Christ to the last,
impassible, incapable of injury, incapable of apprehension. By and by, when it came to a
question of capture, he departed from him during the examination before Pilate. In like
manner, his mother’s seed did not admit of being injured, being equally exempt from all
manner of outrage,6861 and being undiscovered even by the Demiurge himself. The animal
and carnal Christ, however, does suffer after the fashion6862 of the superior Christ, who,
for the purpose of producing Achamoth, had been stretched upon the cross, that is, Horos,
in a substantial though not a cognizable6863 form. In this manner do they reduce all things
to mere images—Christians themselves being indeed nothing but imaginary beings!</p>

the Seed, and the Demiurge), no sooner heard of the advent of Soter (Saviour) than he runs
to him with haste and joy, with all his might, like the centurion in the Gospel.6865 And being
enlightened by him on all points, he learns from him also of his own prospect how that he
is to succeed to his mother’s place. Being thenceforth free from all care, he carries on the

<head>Chapter XXIX.—The Three Natures Again Adverted to. They are All Exemplified
Amongst Men. For Instance, by Cain, and Abel, and Seth.</head>
<p>I will now collect from different sources, by way of conclusion, what they affirm concerning
the dispensation6866 of the whole human race. Having at first stated their views as
to man’s threefold nature—which was, however, united in one6867 in the case of Adam—they
then proceed after him to divide it (into three) with their especial characteristics, finding
opportunity for such distinction in the posterity of Adam himself, in which occurs a threefold
division as to moral differences. Cain and Abel, and Seth, who were in a certain sense the
sources of the human race, become the fountain-heads of just as many qualities6868 of nature
and essential character.6869 The material nature,6870 which had become reprobate for salvation,
they assign to Cain; the animal nature, which was poised between divergent hopes,
they find6871 in Abel; the spiritual, preordained for certain salvation, they store up6872 in
Seth. In this way also they make a twofold distinction among souls, as to their property of
good and evil—according to the material condition derived from Cain, or the animal from
Abel. Men’s spiritual state they derive over and above the other conditions,6873 from Seth
adventitiously,6874 not in the way of nature, but of grace,6875 in such wise that Achamoth
infuses it6876 among superior beings like rain6877 into good souls, that is, those who are
enrolled in the animal class. Whereas the material class—in other words, those which are
bad souls—they say, never receive the blessings of salvation;6878 for that nature they have
pronounced to be incapable of any change or reform in its natural condition.6879 This grain,
then, of spiritual seed is modest and very small when cast from her hand, but under her in-

pretence which may suit their pleasure. For this rule, (they say), is enjoined upon the animal

we may work out by right6885 of our conduct. Upon us, who are of an imperfect nature,6886

she, too, found sin no unprofitable pursuit. Now it is held amongst them, that, for the purpose
of honouring the celestial marriages,6891 it is necessary to contemplate and celebrate the
mystery always by cleaving to a companion, that, is to a woman; otherwise (they account

loving a woman or uniting himself to her. Then what is to become of the eunuchs whom

Well as Among Men. How Achamoth and the Demiurge are Affected Then.
Irony on the Subject.</head>
<p>It remains that we say something about the end of the world,6893 and the dispensing of
reward. As soon as Achamoth has completed the full harvest of her seed, and has then proceeded
to gather it into her garner, or, after it has been taken to the mill and ground to flour,
has hidden it in the kneading-trough with yeast until the whole be leavened, then shall the
end speedily come.6894 Then, to begin with, Achamoth herself removes from the middle
region,6895 from the second stage to the highest, since she is restored to the Pleroma: she is
immediately received by that paragon of perfection6896 Soter, as her spouse of course, and
they two afterwards consummate6897 new nuptials. This must be the spouse of the Scripture,
6898 the Pleroma of espousals (for you might suppose that the Julian laws6899 were interposing,
since there are these migrations from place to place). In like manner, the Demiurge,
too, will then change the scene of his abode from the celestial Hebdomad6900 to the higher
regions, to his mother’s now vacant saloon6901—by this time knowing her, without however
seeing her. (A happy coincidence!) For if he had caught a glance of her, he would have preferred
never to have known her.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXII.—Indignant Irony Exposing the Valentinian Fable About the Judicial
Treatment of Mankind at the Last Judgment. The Immorality of the Doctrine.</head>
<p>As for the human race, its end will be to the following effect:—To all which bear the
earthy6902 and material mark there accrues an entire destruction, because “all flesh is
grass,”6903 and amongst these is the soul of mortal man, except when it has found salvation
by faith. The souls of just men, that is to say, our souls, will be conveyed to the Demiurge
in the abodes of the middle region. We are duly thankful; we shall be content to be classed
with our god, in whom lies our own origin.6904 Into the palace of the Pleroma nothing of
the animal nature is admitted—nothing but the spiritual swarm of Valentinus. There, then,
the first process is the despoiling of men themselves, that is, men within the Pleroma.6905
Now this despoiling consists of the putting off of the souls in which they appear to be clothed,
which they will give back to their Demiurge as they had obtained6906 them from him. They
will then become wholly intellectual spirits—impalpable,6907 invisible6908—and in this state
will be readmitted invisibly to the Pleroma—stealthily, if the case admits of the idea.6909
What then? They will be dispersed amongst the angels, the attendants on Soter. As sons,
do you suppose? Not at all. As servants, then? No, not even so. Well, as phantoms? Would
that it were nothing more! Then in what capacity, if you are ashamed to tell us? In the capacity
of brides. Then will they end6910 their Sabine rapes with the sanction of wedlock. This will
be the guerdon of the spiritual, this the recompense of their faith! Such fables have their
use. Although but a Marcus or a Gaius,6911 full-grown in this flesh of ours, with a beard
and such like proofs (of virility,) it may be a stern husband, a father, a grandfather, a greatgrandfather
(never mind what, in fact, if only a male), you may perhaps in the bridalchamber

instead of the torch and veil, I suppose that secret fire is then to burst forth, which, after
devastating the whole existence of things, will itself also be reduced to nothing at last, after
everything has been reduced to ashes; and so their fable too will be ended.6914 But I, too,
am no doubt a rash man, in having exposed so great a mystery in so derisive a way: I ought
to be afraid that Achamoth, who did not choose to make herself known even to her own
son, would turn mad, that Theletus would be enraged, that Fortune6915 would be irritated.
But I am yet a liege-man of the Demiurge. I have to return after death to the place where
there is no more giving in marriage, where I have to be clothed upon rather than to be despoiled,—
where, even if I am despoiled of my sex, I am classed with angels—not a male
angel, nor a female one. There will be no one to do aught against me, nor will they then find
any male energy in me.</p>

<p>I shall now at last produce, by way of finale,6916 after so long a story, those points which,
not to interrupt the course of it, and by the interruption distract the reader’s attention, I
have preferred reserving to this place. They have been variously advanced by those who
have improved on6917 the doctrines of Ptolemy. For there have been in his school “disciples
above their master,” who have attributed to their Bythus two wives—Cogitatio (Thought)
and Voluntas (Will). For Cogitatio alone was not sufficient wherewith to produce any offspring,
although from the two wives procreation was most easy to him. The former bore
him Monogenes (Only-Begotten) and Veritas (Truth). Veritas was a female after the likeness
of Cogitatio; Monogenes a male bearing a resemblance to Voluntas. For it is the strength
of Voluntas which procures the masculine nature,6918 inasmuch as she affords efficiency
to Cogitatio.</p>

the Deity, Characteristic Raillery.</head>
<p>Others of purer mind, mindful of the honour of the Deity, have, for the purpose of
freeing him from the discredit of even single wedlock, preferred assigning no sex whatever
to Bythus; and therefore very likely they talk of “this deity” in the neuter gender rather than
“this god.” Others again, on the other hand, speak of him as both masculine and feminine,

of Dispute; Now His Rank Comes in Question. Absurd Substitutes for Bythus
Criticised by Tertullian.</head>
<p>There are some who do not claim the first place for Bythus, but only a lower one. They
put their Ogdoad in the foremost rank; itself, however, derived from a Tetrad, but under
different names. For they put Pro-arche (Before the Beginning) first, Anennoetos (Inconceivable)
second, Arrhetos (Indescribable) third, Aoratos (Invisible) fourth. Then after Pro-arche
they say Arche (Beginning) came forth and occupied the first and the fifth place; from
Anennoetos came Acataleptos (Incomprehensible) in the second and the sixth place; from
Arrhetos came Anonomastos (Nameless) in the third and the seventh place; from Aoratos6919
came Agennetos (Unbegotten) in the fourth and the eight place. Now by what method he
arranges this, that each of these Æons should be born in two places, and that, too, at such
intervals, I prefer to be ignorant of than to be informed. For what can be right in a system
which is propounded with such absurd particulars?</p>

<p>How much more sensible are they who, rejecting all this tiresome nonsense, have refused
to believe that any one Æon has descended from another by steps like these, which are really
neither more nor less Gemonian;6920 but that on a given signal6921 the eight-fold emanation,
of which we have heard,6922 issued all at once from the Father and His Ennoea
(Thought),6923—that it is, in fact, from His mere motion that they gain their designations.
When, as they say, He thought of producing offspring, He on that account gained the name
of Father. After producing, because the issue which He produced was true, He received the
name of Truth. When He wanted Himself to be manifested, He on that account was announced
as Man. Those, moreover, whom He preconceived in His thought when He pro-
duced them, were then designated the Church. As man, He uttered His Word; and so this
Word is His first-begotten Son, and to the Word was added Life. And by this process the
first Ogdoad was completed. However, the whole of this tiresome story is utterly poor and
weak.</p>

<p>Now listen to some other buffooneries6924 of a master who is a great swell among
them,6925 and who has pronounced his dicta with an even priestly authority. They run thus:
There comes, says he, before all things Pro-arche, the inconceivable, and indescribable, and
nameless, which I for my own part call Monotes (Solitude). With this was associated another
power, to which also I give the name of Henotes (Unity). Now, inasmuch as Monotes and
Henotes—that is to say, Solitude and Union—were only one being, they produced, and yet
not in the way of production,6926 the intellectual, innascible, invisible beginning of all things,
which human language6927 has called Monad (Solitude).6928 This has inherent in itself a
consubstantial force, which it calls Unity6929 These powers, accordingly, Solitude or Solitariness,
and Unity, or Union, propagated all the other emanations of Æons.6930 Wonderful
distinction, to be sure! Whatever change Union and Unity may undergo, Solitariness and
Solitude is profoundly supreme. Whatever designation you give the power, it is one and the
same.</p>

Vitiates Every Gnostic School.</head>
<p>Now, concerning even the Lord Jesus, into how great a diversity of opinion are they
divided! One party form Him of the blossoms of all the Æons.6932 Another party will have
it that He is made up only of those ten whom the Word and the Life6933 produced;6934 from
which circumstance the titles of the Word and the Life were suitably transferred to Him.
Others, again, that He rather sprang from the twelve, the offspring of Man and the
Church,6935 and therefore, they say, He was designated “Son of man.” Others, moreover,
maintain that He was formed by Christ and the Holy Spirit, who have to provide for the establishment
of the universe,6936 and that He inherits by right His Father’s appellation. Some
there are who have imagined that another origin must be found for the title “Son of man;”
for they have had the presumption to call the Father Himself Man, by reason of the profound
mystery of this title: so that what can you hope for more ample concerning faith in that God,
with whom you are now yourself on a par? Such conceits are constantly cropping out6937

<p>They who are so anxious to shake that belief in the resurrection which was firmly
settled6940 before the appearance of our modern Sadducees,6941 as even to deny that the
expectation thereof has any relation whatever to the flesh, have great cause for besetting the
flesh of Christ also with doubtful questions, as if it either had no existence at all, or possessed
a nature altogether different from human flesh. For they cannot but be apprehensive that, if
it be once determined that Christ’s flesh was human, a presumption would immediately
arise in opposition to them, that that flesh must by all means rise again, which has already
risen in Christ. Therefore we shall have to guard our belief in the resurrection6942 from the
same armoury, whence they get their weapons of destruction. Let us examine our Lord’s
bodily substance, for about His spiritual nature all are agreed.6943 It is His flesh that is in

question. Its verity and quality are the points in dispute. Did it ever exist? whence was it
derived? and of what kind was it? If we succeed in demonstrating it, we shall lay down a law
for our own resurrection. Marcion, in order that he might deny the flesh of Christ, denied
also His nativity, or else he denied His flesh in order that he might deny His nativity; because,
of course, he was afraid that His nativity and His flesh bore mutual testimony to each other’s
reality, since there is no nativity without flesh, and no flesh without nativity. As if indeed,
under the prompting of that licence which is ever the same in all heresy, he too might not
very well have either denied the nativity, although admitting the flesh,—like Apelles, who
was first a disciple of his, and afterwards an apostate,—or, while admitting both the flesh
and the nativity, have interpreted them in a different sense, as did Valentinus, who resembled
Apelles both in his discipleship and desertion of Marcion. At all events, he who represented
the flesh of Christ to be imaginary was equally able to pass off His nativity as a phantom;
so that the virgin’s conception, and pregnancy, and child-bearing, and then the whole
course6944 of her infant too, would have to be regarded as putative.6945 These facts pertaining
to the nativity of Christ would escape the notice of the same eyes and the same senses as
failed to grasp the full idea6946 of His flesh.</p>

<p>Clearly enough is the nativity announced by Gabriel.6947 But what has he to do with
the Creator’s angel?6948 The conception in the virgin’s womb is also set plainly before us.
But what concern has he with the Creator’s prophet, Isaiah?6949 He6950 will not brook delay,
since suddenly (without any prophetic announcement) did he bring down Christ from
heaven.6951 “Away,” says he, “with that eternal plaguey taxing of Cæsar, and the scanty inn,
and the squalid swaddling-clothes, and the hard stable.6952 We do not care a jot for6953 that
multitude of the heavenly host which praised their Lord at night.6954 Let the shepherds take
better care of their flock,6955 and let the wise men spare their legs so long a journey;6956 let
them keep their gold to themselves.6957 Let Herod, too, mend his manners, so that Jeremy
may not glory over him.6958 Spare also the babe from circumcision, that he may escape the
pain thereof; nor let him be brought into the temple, lest he burden his parents with the
expense of the offering;6959 nor let him be handed to Simeon, lest the old man be saddened

proofs of its reality. But, prithee, on what grounds (do you do this)? Show me your authority.

you are no Christian, because you do not believe that which by being believed makes men

to Him. With God, however, nothing is impossible but what He does not will. Let
us consider, then, whether He willed to be born (for if He had the will, He also had the
power, and was born). I put the argument very briefly. If God had willed not to be born, it
matters not why, He would not have presented Himself in the likeness of man. Now who,
when he sees a man, would deny that he had been born? What God therefore willed not to
be, He would in no wise have willed the seeming to be. When a thing is distasteful, the very
notion6972 of it is scouted; because it makes no difference whether a thing exist or do not
exist, if, when it does not exist, it is yet assumed to exist. It is of course of the greatest importance
that there should be nothing false (or pretended) attributed to that which really
does not exist.6973 But, say you, His own consciousness (of the truth of His nature) was
enough for Him. If any supposed that He had been born, because they saw Him as a man,
that was their concern.6974 Yet with how much more dignity and consistency would He
have sustained the human character on the supposition that He was truly born; for if He
were not born, He could not have undertaken the said character without injury to that
consciousness of His which you on your side attribute to His confidence of being able to
sustain, although not born, the character of having been born even against! His own consciousness!
6975 Why, I want to know,6976 was it of so much importance, that Christ should,
when perfectly aware what He really was, exhibit Himself as being that which He was not?
You cannot express any apprehension that,6977 if He had been born and truly clothed

that answered every purpose. God knew better: and He was moreover, strong enough to obviate all inconveniences
of the deception by His unfaltering fortitude, etc. All this, however, seemed to Tertullian to be simply damaging
and perilous to the character of God, even from Marcion’s own point of view.</note>

Himself with man’s nature, He would have ceased to be God, losing what He was, while
becoming what He was not. For God is in no danger of losing His own state and condition.
But, say you, I deny that God was truly changed to man in such wise as to be born and endued
with a body of flesh, on this ground, that a being who is without end is also of necessity incapable
of change. For being changed into something else puts an end to the former state.
Change, therefore, is not possible to a Being who cannot come to an end. Without doubt,
the nature of things which are subject to change is regulated by this law, that they have no
permanence in the state which is undergoing change in them, and that they come to an end
from thus wanting permanence, whilst they lose that in the process of change which they
previously were. But nothing is equal with God; His nature is different6978 from the condition
of all things. If, then, the things which differ from God, and from which God differs, lose
what existence they had whilst they are undergoing change, wherein will consist the difference
of the Divine Being from all other things except in His possessing the contrary faculty of
theirs,—in other words, that God can be changed into all conditions, and yet continue just
as He is? On any other supposition, He would be on the same level with those things which,
when changed, lose the existence they had before; whose equal, of course, He is not in any
other respect, as He certainly is not in the changeful issues6979 of their nature. You have
sometimes read and believed that the Creator’s angels have been changed into human form,
and have even borne about so veritable a body, that Abraham even washed their feet,6980
and Lot was rescued from the Sodomites by their hands;6981 an angel, moreover, wrestled
with a man so strenuously with his body, that the latter desired to be let loose, so tightly was
he held.6982 Has it, then, been permitted to angels, which are inferior to God, after they
have been changed into human bodily form,6983 nevertheless to remain angels? and will
you deprive God, their superior, of this faculty, as if Christ could not continue to be God,
after His real assumption of the nature of man? Or else, did those angels appear as phantoms
of flesh? You will not, however, have the courage to say this; for if it be so held in your belief,
that the Creator’s angels are in the same condition as Christ, then Christ will belong to the
same God as those angels do, who are like Christ in their condition. If you had not purposely
rejected in some instances, and corrupted in others, the Scriptures which are opposed to
your opinion, you would have been confuted in this matter by the Gospel of John, when it

When the said Spirit was in this condition, He was as truly a dove as He was also a spirit;
nor did He destroy His own proper substance by the assumption of an extraneous substance.
But you ask what becomes of the dove’s body, after the return of the Spirit back to heaven,
and similarly in the case of the angels. Their withdrawal was effected in the same manner
as their appearance had been. If you had seen how their production out of nothing had
been effected, you would have known also the process of their return to nothing. If the initial
step was out of sight, so was also the final one. Still there was solidity in their bodily substance,
whatever may have been the force by which the body became visible. What is written cannot
but have been.</p>

of dislike and desire. Inveigh now likewise against the shame itself of a woman in travail6989

Yourself, of course, you had no love of, when you departed from the Church and the

you were born in a way different from other people. Christ, at any rate, has loved even that
man who was condensed in his mother’s womb amidst all its uncleannesses, even that man
who was brought into life out of the said womb, even that man who was nursed amidst the
nurse’s simpers.6995 For his sake He came down (from heaven), for his sake He preached,

for his sake “He humbled Himself even unto death—the death of the cross.”6996 He loved,
of course, the being whom He redeemed at so great a cost. If Christ is the Creator’s Son, it
was with justice that He loved His own (creature); if He comes from another god, His love
was excessive, since He redeemed a being who belonged to another. Well, then, loving man
He loved his nativity also, and his flesh as well. Nothing can be loved apart from that through
which whatever exists has its existence. Either take away nativity, and then show us your
man; or else withdraw the flesh, and then present to our view the being whom God has redeemed—
since it is these very conditions6997 which constitute the man whom God has redeemed.
And are you for turning these conditions into occasions of blushing to the very
creature whom He has redeemed, (censuring them), too, as unworthy of Him who certainly
would not have redeemed them had He not loved them? Our birth He reforms from death
by a second birth from heaven;6998 our flesh He restores from every harassing malady; when
leprous, He cleanses it of the stain; when blind, He rekindles its light; when palsied, He renews
its strength; when possessed with devils, He exorcises it; when dead, He reanimates it,—then
shall we blush to own it? If, to be sure,6999 He had chosen to be born of a mere animal, and
were to preach the kingdom of heaven invested with the body of a beast either wild or tame,
your censure (I imagine) would have instantly met Him with this demurrer: “This is disgraceful
for God, and this is unworthy of the Son of God, and simply foolish.” For no other
reason than because one thus judges. It is of course foolish, if we are to judge God by our
own conceptions. But, Marcion, consider well this Scripture, if indeed you have not erased
it: “God hath chosen the foolish things of the world, to confound the wise.”7000 Now what
are those foolish things? Are they the conversion of men to the worship of the true God, the
rejection of error, the whole training in righteousness, chastity, mercy, patience, and innocence?
These things certainly are not “foolish.” Inquire again, then, of what things he spoke,
and when you imagine that you have discovered what they are will you find anything to be
so “foolish” as believing in a God that has been born, and that of a virgin, and of a fleshly
nature too, who wallowed in all the before-mentioned humiliations of nature? But some
one may say, “These are not the foolish things; they must be other things which God has
chosen to confound the wisdom of the world.” And yet, according to the world’s wisdom,
it is more easy to believe that Jupiter became a bull or a swan, if we listen to Marcion, than
that Christ really became a man.</p>

<p>There are, to be sure, other things also quite as foolish (as the birth of Christ), which
have reference to the humiliations and sufferings of God. Or else, let them call a crucified
God “wisdom.” But Marcion will apply the knife7001 to this doctrine also, and even with
greater reason. For which is more unworthy of God, which is more likely to raise a blush of
shame, that God should be born, or that He should die? that He should bear the flesh, or
the cross? be circumcised, or be crucified? be cradled, or be coffined?7002 be laid in a manger,
or in a tomb? Talk of “wisdom!” You will show more of that if you refuse to believe this also.
But, after all, you will not be “wise” unless you become a “fool” to the world, by believing
“the foolish things of God.” Have you, then, cut away7003 all sufferings from Christ, on the
ground that, as a mere phantom, He was incapable of experiencing them? We have said
above that He might possibly have undergone the unreal mockeries7004 of an imaginary
birth and infancy. But answer me at once, you that murder truth: Was not God really crucified?
And, having been really crucified, did He not really die? And, having indeed really
died, did He not really rise again? Falsely did Paul7005 “determine to know nothing amongst
us but Jesus and Him crucified;”7006 falsely has he impressed upon us that He was buried;
falsely inculcated that He rose again. False, therefore, is our faith also. And all that we hope
for from Christ will be a phantom. O thou most infamous of men, who acquittest of all
guilt7007 the murderers of God! For nothing did Christ suffer from them, if He really suffered
nothing at all. Spare the whole world’s one only hope, thou who art destroying the indispensable
dishonour of our faith.7008 Whatsoever is unworthy of God, is of gain to me. I am safe,
if I am not ashamed of my Lord. “Whosoever,” says He, “shall be ashamed of me, of him
will I also be ashamed.”7009 Other matters for shame find I none which can prove me to be
shameless in a good sense, and foolish in a happy one, by my own contempt of shame. The
Son of God was crucified; I am not ashamed because men must needs be ashamed of it.
And the Son of God died; it is by all means to be believed, because it is absurd.7010 And He

was buried, and rose again; the fact is certain, because it is impossible. But how will all this
be true in Him, if He was not Himself true—if He really had not in Himself that which might
be crucified, might die, might be buried, and might rise again? I mean this flesh suffused
with blood, built up with bones, interwoven with nerves, entwined with veins, a flesh which
knew how to be born, and how to die, human without doubt, as born of a human being. It
will therefore be mortal in Christ, because Christ is man and the Son of man. Else why is
Christ man and the Son of man, if he has nothing of man, and nothing from man? Unless
it be either that man is anything else than flesh, or man’s flesh comes from any other source
than man, or Mary is anything else than a human being, or Marcion’s man is as Marcion’s
god.7011 Otherwise Christ could not be described as being man without flesh, nor the Son
of man without any human parent; just as He is not God without the Spirit of God, nor the
Son of God without having God for His father. Thus the nature7012 of the two substances
displayed Him as man and God,—in one respect born, in the other unborn; in one respect
fleshly, in the other spiritual; in one sense weak, in the other exceeding strong; in one sense
dying, in the other living. This property of the two states—the divine and the human—is
distinctly asserted7013 with equal truth of both natures alike, with the same belief both in
respect of the Spirit7014 and of the flesh. The powers of the Spirit,7015 proved Him to be
God, His sufferings attested the flesh of man. If His powers were not without the Spirit7016
in like manner, were not His sufferings without the flesh. If His flesh with its sufferings was
fictitious, for the same reason was the Spirit false with all its powers. Wherefore halve7017
Christ with a lie? He was wholly the truth. Believe me, He chose rather to be born, than in
any part to pretend—and that indeed to His own detriment—that He was bearing about a
flesh hardened without bones, solid without muscles, bloody without blood, clothed without
the tunic of skin,7018 hungry without appetite, eating without teeth, speaking without a
tongue, so that His word was a phantom to the ears through an imaginary voice. A phantom,

<head>Chapter VI.—The Doctrine of Apelles Refuted, that Christ’s Body Was of Sidereal
Substance, Not Born. Nativity and Mortality are Correlative Circumstances, and
in Christ’s Case His Death Proves His Birth.</head>
<p>But certain disciples7021 of the heretic of Pontus, compelled to be wiser than their
teacher, concede to Christ real flesh, without effect, however, on7022 their denial of His
nativity. He might have had, they say, a flesh which was not at all born. So we have found
our way “out of a frying-pan,” as the proverb runs, “into the fire,”7023—from Marcion to
Apelles. This man having first fallen from the principles of Marcion into (intercourse with)
a woman, in the flesh, and afterwards shipwrecked himself, in the spirit, on the virgin Philumene,
7024 proceeded from that time7025 to preach that the body of Christ was of solid
flesh, but without having been born. To this angel, indeed, of Philumene, the apostle will
reply in tones like those in which he even then predicted him, saying, “Although an angel
from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you,
let him be accursed.”7026 To the arguments, however, which have been indicated just above,
we have now to show our resistance. They allow that Christ really had a body. Whence was
the material of it, if not from the same sort of thing as7027 that in which He appeared?
Whence came His body, if His body were not flesh? Whence came His flesh, if it were not
born? Inasmuch as that which is born must undergo this nativity in order to become flesh.
He borrowed, they say, His flesh from the stars, and from the substances of the higher world.
And they assert it for a certain principle, that a body without nativity is nothing to be astonished
at, because it has been submitted to angels to appear even amongst ourselves in the
flesh without the intervention of the womb. We admit, of course, that such facts have been
related. But then, how comes it to pass that a faith which holds to a different rule borrows
materials for its own arguments from the faith which it impugns? What has it to do with
Moses, who has rejected the God of Moses? Since the God is a different one, everything
belonging to him must be different also. But let the heretics always use the Scriptures of
that God whose world they also enjoy. The fact will certainly recoil on them as a witness to
judge them, that they maintain their own blasphemies from examples derived from Him.7028

But it is an easy task for the truth to prevail without raising any such demurrer against them.
When, therefore, they set forth the flesh of Christ after the pattern of the angels, declaring
it to be not born, and yet flesh for all that, I should wish them to compare the causes, both
in Christ’s case and that of the angels, wherefore they came in the flesh. Never did any angel
descend for the purpose of being crucified, of tasting death, and of rising again from the
dead. Now, since there never was such a reason for angels becoming embodied, you have
the cause why they assumed flesh without undergoing birth. They had not come to die,
therefore they also (came not) to be born. Christ, however, having been sent to die, had
necessarily to be also born, that He might be capable of death; for nothing is in the habit of
dying but that which is born. Between nativity and mortality there is a mutual contrast. The
law7029 which makes us die is the cause of our being born. Now, since Christ died owing to
the condition which undergoes death, but that undergoes death which is also born, the
consequence was—nay, it was an antecedent necessity—that He must have been born
also,7030 by reason of the condition which undergoes birth; because He had to die in obedience
to that very condition which, because it begins with birth, ends in death.7031 It was not
fitting for Him not to be born under the pretence7032 that it was fitting for Him to die. But
the Lord Himself at that very time appeared to Abraham amongst those angels without being
born, and yet in the flesh without doubt, in virtue of the before-mentioned diversity of
cause. You, however, cannot admit this, since you do not receive that Christ, who was even
then rehearsing7033 how to converse with, and liberate, and judge the human race, in the
habit of a flesh which as yet was not born, because it did not yet mean to die until both its
nativity and mortality were previously (by prophecy) announced. Let them, then, prove to
us that those angels derived their flesh from the stars. If they do not prove it because it is
not written, neither will the flesh of Christ get its origin therefrom, for which they borrowed
the precedent of the angels. It is plain that the angels bore a flesh which was not naturally
their own; their nature being of a spiritual substance, although in some sense peculiar to
themselves, corporeal; and yet they could be transfigured into human shape, and for the
time be able to appear and have intercourse with men. Since, therefore, it has not been told
us whence they obtained their flesh, it remains for us not to doubt in our minds that a
property of angelic power is this, to assume to themselves bodily shape out of no material
substance. How much more, you say, is it (within their competence to take a body) out of

some material substance? That is true enough. But there is no evidence of this, because
Scripture says nothing. Then, again,7034 how should they who are able to form themselves
into that which by nature they are not, be unable to do this out of no material substance? If
they become that which they are not, why cannot they so become out of that which is not?
But that which has not existence when it comes into existence, is made out of nothing. This
is why it is unnecessary either to inquire or to demonstrate what has subsequently become
of their7035 bodies. What came out of nothing, came to nothing. They, who were able to
convert themselves into flesh have it in their power to convert nothing itself into flesh. It is
a greater thing to change a nature than to make matter. But even if it were necessary to
suppose that angels derived their flesh from some material substance, it is surely more
credible that it was from some earthly matter than from any kind of celestial substances,
since it was composed of so palpably terrene a quality that it fed on earthly ailments. Suppose
that even now a celestial flesh7036 had fed on earthly aliments, although it was not itself
earthly, in the same way that earthly flesh actually fed on celestial aliments, although it had
nothing of the celestial nature (for we read of manna having been food for the people: “Man,”
says the Psalmist, “did eat angels’ bread,”7037) yet this does not once infringe the separate
condition of the Lord’s flesh, because of His different destination. For One who was to be
truly a man, even unto death, it was necessary that He should be clothed with that flesh to
which death belongs. Now that flesh to which death belongs is preceded by birth.</p>

<p>But whenever a dispute arises about the nativity, all who reject it as creating a presumption
in favour of the reality of Christ’s flesh, wilfully deny that God Himself was born, on
the ground that He asked, “Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?”7038 Let, therefore,
Apelles hear what was our answer to Marcion in that little work, in which we challenged
his own (favourite) gospel to the proof, even that the material circumstances of that remark
(of the Lord’s) should be considered.7039 First of all, nobody would have told Him that His
mother and brethren were standing outside, if he were not certain both that He had a
mother and brethren, and that they were the very persons whom he was then announcing,—
who had either been known to him before, or were then and there discovered by
him; although heretics7040 have removed this passage from the gospel, because those who
were admiring His doctrine said that His supposed father, Joseph the carpenter, and His
mother Mary, and His brethren, and His sisters, were very well known to them. But it was
with the view of tempting Him, that they had mentioned to Him a mother and brethren
which He did not possess. The Scripture says nothing of this, although it is not in other instances
silent when anything was done against Him by way of temptation. “Behold,” it says,
“a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted Him.”7041 And in another passage: “The Pharisees
also came unto Him, tempting Him.” Who7042 was to prevent its being in this place also
indicated that this was done with the view of tempting Him? I do not admit what you advance
of your own apart from Scripture. Then there ought to be suggested7043 some occasion7044
for the temptation. What could they have thought to be in Him which required temptation?
The question, to be sure, whether He had been born or not? For if this point were denied
in His answer, it might come out on the announcement of a temptation. And yet no
temptation, when aiming at the discovery of the point which prompts the temptation by its
doubtfulness, falls upon one so abruptly, as not to be preceded by the question which compels
the temptation whilst raising the doubt. Now, since the nativity of Christ had never come
into question, how can you contend that they meant by their temptation to inquire about

<pb n="1178"/>
a point on which they had never raised a doubt? Besides,7045 if He had to be tempted about
His birth, this of course was not the proper way of doing it,—by announcing those persons
who, even on the supposition of His birth, might possibly not have been in existence. We
have all been born, and yet all of us have not either brothers or mother. He might with more
probability have had even a father than a mother, and uncles more likely than brothers.
Thus is the temptation about His birth unsuitable, for it might have been contrived without
any mention of either His mother or His brethren. It is clearly more credible that, being
certain that He had both a mother and brothers, they tested His divinity rather than His
nativity, whether, when within, He knew what was without; being tried by the untrue announcement
of the presence of persons who were not present. But the artifice of a temptation
might have been thwarted thus: it might have happened that He knew that those whom
they were announcing to be “standing without,” were in fact absent by the stress either of
sickness, or of business, or a journey which He was at the time aware of. No one tempts
(another) in a way in which he knows that he may have himself to bear the shame of the
temptation. There being, then, no suitable occasion for a temptation, the announcement
that His mother and His brethren had actually turned up7046 recovers its naturalness. But
there is some ground for thinking that Christ’s answer denies His mother and brethren for
the present, as even Apelles might learn. “The Lord’s brethren had not yet believed in
Him.”7047 So is it contained in the Gospel which was published before Marcion’s time;
whilst there is at the same time a want of evidence of His mother’s adherence to Him, although
the Marthas and the other Marys were in constant attendance on Him. In this very
passage indeed, their unbelief is evident. Jesus was teaching the way of life, preaching the
kingdom of God and actively engaged in healing infirmities of body and soul; but all the
while, whilst strangers were intent on Him, His very nearest relatives were absent. By and
by they turn up, and keep outside; but they do not go in, because, forsooth, they set small
store7048 on that which was doing within; nor do they even wait,7049 as if they had something
which they could contribute more necessary than that which He was so earnestly doing; but
they prefer to interrupt Him, and wish to call Him away from His great work. Now, I ask
you, Apelles, or will you Marcion, please (to tell me), if you happened to be at a stage play,
or had laid a wager7050 on a foot race or a chariot race, and were called away by such a
message, would you not have exclaimed, “What are mother and brothers to me?”7051 And

<pb n="1179"/>
did not Christ, whilst preaching and manifesting God, fulfilling the law and the prophets,
and scattering the darkness of the long preceding age, justly employ this same form of words,
in order to strike the unbelief of those who stood outside, or to shake off the importunity
of those who would call Him away from His work? If, however, He had meant to deny His
own nativity, He would have found place, time, and means for expressing Himself very
differently,7052 and not in words which might be uttered by one who had both a mother
and brothers. When denying one’s parents in indignation, one does not deny their existence,
but censures their faults. Besides, He gave others the preference; and since He shows their
title to this favour—even because they listened to the word (of God)—He points out in what
sense He denied His mother and His brethren. For in whatever sense He adopted as His
own those who adhered to Him, in that did He deny as His7053 those who kept aloof from
Him. Christ also is wont to do to the utmost that which He enjoins on others. How strange,
then, would it certainly7054 have been, if, while he was teaching others not to esteem
mother, or father, or brothers, as highly as the word of God, He were Himself to leave the
word of God as soon as His mother and brethren were announced to Him! He denied His
parents, then, in the sense in which He has taught us to deny ours—for God’s work. But
there is also another view of the case: in the abjured mother there is a figure of the synagogue,
as well as of the Jews in the unbelieving brethren. In their person Israel remained outside,
whilst the new disciples who kept close to Christ within, hearing and believing, represented
the Church, which He called mother in a preferable sense and a worthier brotherhood, with
the repudiation of the carnal relationship. It was in just the same sense, indeed, that He also
replied to that exclamation (of a certain woman), not denying His mother’s “womb and
paps,” but designating those as more “blessed who hear the word of God.”7055</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Apelles and His Followers, Displeased with Our Earthly Bodies, Attributed
to Christ a Body of a Purer Sort. How Christ Was Heavenly Even in His
Earthly Flesh.</head>
<p>These passages alone, in which Apelles and Marcion seem to place their chief reliance
when interpreted according to the truth of the entire uncorrupted gospel, ought to have
been sufficient for proving the human flesh of Christ by a defence of His birth. But since
Apelles’ precious set7056 lay a very great stress on the shameful condition7057 of the flesh,
which they will have to have been furnished with souls tampered with by the fiery author
of evil,7058 and so unworthy of Christ; and because they on that account suppose that a
sidereal substance is suitable for Him, I am bound to refute them on their own ground. They
mention a certain angel of great renown as having created this world of ours, and as having,
after the creation, repented of his work. This indeed we have treated of in a passage by itself;
for we have written a little work in opposition to them, on the question whether one who
had the spirit, and will, and power of Christ for such operations, could have done anything
which required repentance, since they describe the said angel by the figure of “the lost sheep.”
The world, then, must be a wrong thing,7059 according to the evidence of its Creator’s repentance;
for all repentance is the admission of fault, nor has it indeed any existence except
through fault. Now, if the world7060 is a fault, as is the body, such must be its parts—faulty
too; so in like manner must be the heaven and its celestial (contents), and everything which
is conceived and produced out of it. And “a corrupt tree must needs bring forth evil fruit.”7061
The flesh of Christ, therefore, if composed of celestial elements, consists of faulty materials,
sinful by reason of its sinful origin;7062 so that it must be a part of that substance which they
disdain to clothe Christ with, because of its sinfulness,—in other words, our own. Then, as
there is no difference in the point of ignominy, let them either devise for Christ some substance
of a purer stamp, since they are displeased with our own, or else let them recognise
this too, than which even a heavenly substance could not have been better. We read in so
many words:7063 “The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from
heaven.”7064 This passage, however, has nothing to do with any difference of substance; it

only contrasts with the once7065 “earthy” substance of the flesh of the first man, Adam, the
“heavenly” substance of the spirit of the second man, Christ. And so entirely does the passage
refer the celestial man to the spirit and not to the flesh, that those whom it compares to Him
evidently become celestial—by the Spirit, of course—even in this “earthy flesh.” Now, since
Christ is heavenly even in regard to the flesh, they could not be compared to Him, who are
not heavenly in reference to their flesh.7066 If, then, they who become heavenly, as Christ
also was, carry about an “earthy” substance of flesh, the conclusion which is affirmed by
this fact is, that Christ Himself also was heavenly, but in an “earthy” flesh, even as they are
who are put on a level with Him.7067</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—Christ’s Flesh Perfectly Natural, Like Our Own. None of the Supernatural
Features Which the Heretics Ascribed to It Discoverable, on a Careful View.</head>
<p>We have thus far gone on the principle, that nothing which is derived from some other
thing, however different it may be from that from which it is derived, is so different as not
to suggest the source from which it comes. No material substance is without the witness of
its own original, however great a change into new properties it may have undergone. There
is this very body of ours, the formation of which out of the dust of the ground is a truth
which has found its way into Gentile fables; it certainly testifies its own origin from the two
elements of earth and water,—from the former by its flesh, from the latter by its blood. Now,
although there is a difference in the appearance of qualities (in other words, that which
proceeds from something else is in development7068 different), yet, after all, what is blood
but red fluid? what is flesh but earth in an especial7069 form? Consider the respective qualities,—
of the muscles as clods; of the bones as stones; the mammillary glands as a kind of
pebbles. Look upon the close junctions of the nerves as propagations of roots, and the
branching courses of the veins as winding rivulets, and the down (which covers us) as moss,
and the hair as grass, and the very treasures of marrow within our bones as ores7070 of flesh.
All these marks of the earthy origin were in Christ; and it is they which obscured Him as
the Son of God, for He was looked on as man, for no other reason whatever than because
He existed in the corporeal substance of a man. Or else, show us some celestial substance
in Him purloined from the Bear, and the Pleiades, and the Hyades. Well, then, the characteristics
which we have enumerated are so many proofs that His was an earthy flesh, as ours
is; but anything new or anything strange I do not discover. Indeed it was from His words
and actions only, from His teaching and miracles solely, that men, though amazed, owned
Christ to be man.7071 But if there had been in Him any new kind of flesh miraculously obtained
(from the stars), it would have been certainly well known.7072 As the case stood,
however, it was actually the ordinary7073 condition of His terrene flesh which made all
things else about Him wonderful, as when they said, “Whence hath this man this wisdom
and these mighty works?”7074 Thus spake even they who despised His outward form. His
body did not reach even to human beauty, to say nothing of heavenly glory.7075 Had the

prophets given us no information whatever concerning His ignoble appearance, His very
sufferings and the very contumely He endured bespeak it all. The sufferings attested His
human flesh, the contumely proved its abject condition. Would any man have dared to
touch even with his little finger, the body of Christ, if it had been of an unusual nature;7076
or to smear His face with spitting, if it had not invited it7077 (by its abjectness)? Why talk
of a heavenly flesh, when you have no grounds to offer us for your celestial theory?7078 Why
deny it to be earthy, when you have the best of reasons for knowing it to be earthy? He
hungered under the devil’s temptation; He thirsted with the woman of Samaria; He wept
over Lazarus; He trembles at death (for “the flesh,” as He says, “is weak”7079); at last, He
pours out His blood. These, I suppose, are celestial marks? But how, I ask, could He have
incurred contempt and suffering in the way I have described, if there had beamed forth in
that flesh of His aught of celestial excellence? From this, therefore, we have a convincing
proof that in it there was nothing of heaven, because it must be capable of contempt and
suffering.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—Another Class of Heretics Refuted. They Alleged that Christ’s Flesh
Was of a Finer Texture, Animalis, Composed of Soul.</head>
<p>I now turn to another class, who are equally wise in their own conceit. They affirm that
the flesh of Christ is composed of soul,7080 that His soul became flesh, so that His flesh is
soul; and as His flesh is of soul, so is His soul of flesh. But here, again, I must have some
reasons. If, in order to save the soul, Christ took a soul within Himself, because it could not
be saved except by Him having it within Himself, I see no reason why, in clothing Himself
with flesh, He should have made that flesh one of soul,7081 as if He could not have saved
the soul in any other way than by making flesh of it. For while He saves our souls, which
are not only not of flesh,7082 but are even distinct from flesh, how much more able was He
to secure salvation to that soul which He took Himself, when it was also not of flesh? Again,
since they assume it as a main tenet,7083 that Christ came forth not to deliver the flesh, but
only our soul, how absurd it is, in the first place, that, meaning to save only the soul, He yet
made it into just that sort of bodily substance which He had no intention of saving! And,
secondly, if He had undertaken to deliver our souls by means of that which He carried, He
ought, in that soul which He carried to have carried our soul, one (that is) of the same condition
as ours; and whatever is the condition of our soul in its secret nature, it is certainly
not one of flesh. However, it was not our soul which He saved, if His own was of flesh; for
ours is not of flesh. Now, if He did not save our soul on the ground, that it was a soul of
flesh which He saved, He is nothing to us, because He has not saved our soul. Nor indeed
did it need salvation, for it was not our soul really, since it was, on the supposition,7084 a
soul of flesh. But yet it is evident that it has been saved. Of flesh, therefore, it was not composed,
and it was ours; for it was our soul that was saved, since that was in peril of damnation.
We therefore now conclude that as in Christ the soul was not of flesh, so neither could His
flesh have possibly been composed of soul.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—The Opposite Extravagance Exposed. That is Christ with a Soul
Composed of Flesh—Corporeal, Though Invisible. Christ’s Soul, Like Ours,
Distinct from Flesh, Though Clothed in It.</head>
<p>But we meet another argument of theirs, when we raise the question why Christ, in assuming
a flesh composed of soul, should seem to have had a soul that was made of flesh?
For God, they say, desired to make the soul visible to men, by enduing it with a bodily nature,
although it was before invisible; of its own nature, indeed, it was incapable of seeing anything,
even its own self, by reason of the obstacle of this flesh, so that it was even a matter of doubt
whether it was born or not. The soul, therefore (they further say), was made corporeal in
Christ, in order that we might see it when undergoing birth, and death, and (what is more)
resurrection. But yet, how was this possible, that by means of the flesh the soul should
demonstrate itself7085 to itself or to us, when it could not possibly be ascertained that it
would offer this mode of exhibiting itself by the flesh, until the thing came into existence
to which it was unknown,7086 that is to say, the flesh? It received darkness, forsooth, in order
to be able to shine! Now,7087 let us first turn our attention to this point, whether it was requisite
that the soul should exhibit itself in the manner contended for;7088 and next consider
whether their previous position be7089 that the soul is wholly invisible (inquiring further)
whether this invisibility is the result of its incorporeality, or whether it actually possesses
some sort of body peculiar to itself. And yet, although they say that it is invisible, they determine
it to be corporeal, but having somewhat that is invisible. For if it has nothing invisible
how can it be said to be invisible? But even its existence is an impossibility, unless it has that
which is instrumental to its existence.7090 Since, however, it exists, it must needs have a
something through which it exists. If it has this something, it must be its body. Everything
which exists is a bodily existence sui generis. Nothing lacks bodily existence but that which
is non-existent. If, then, the soul has an invisible body, He who had proposed to make it7091
visible would certainly have done His work better7092 if He had made that part of it which
was accounted invisible, visible; because then there would have been no untruth or weakness
in the case, and neither of these flaws is suitable to God. (But as the case stands in the hypo-

thesis) there is untruth, since He has set forth the soul as being a different thing from what
it really is; and there is weakness, since He was unable to make it appear7093 to be that which
it is. No one who wishes to exhibit a man covers him with a veil7094 or a mask. This, however,
is precisely what has been done to the soul, if it has been clothed with a covering belonging
to something else, by being converted into flesh. But even if the soul is, on their hypothesis,
supposed7095 to be incorporeal, so that the soul, whatever it is, should by some mysterious
force of the reason7096 be quite unknown, only not be a body, then in that case it were not
beyond the power of God—indeed it would be more consistent with His plan—if He displayed7097
the soul in some new sort of body, different from that which we all have in
common, one of which we should have quite a different notion,7098 (being spared the idea
that)7099 He had set His mind on7100 making, without an adequate cause, a visible soul instead
of7101 an invisible one—a fit incentive, no doubt, for such questions as they start,7102
by their maintenance of a human flesh for it.7103 Christ, however, could not have appeared
among men except as a man. Restore, therefore, to Christ, His faith; believe that He who
willed to walk the earth as a man exhibited even a soul of a thoroughly human condition,
not making it of flesh, but clothing it with flesh.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—The True Functions of the Soul. Christ Assumed It in His Perfect
Human Nature, Not to Reveal and Explain It, But to Save It. Its Resurrection
with the Body Assured by Christ.</head>
<p>Well, now, let it be granted that the soul is made apparent by the flesh,7104 on the assumption
that it was evidently necessary7105 that it should be made apparent in some way
or other, that is, as being incognizable to itself and to us: there is still an absurd distinction
in this hypothesis, which implies that we are ourselves separate from our soul, when all that
we are is soul. Indeed,7106 without the soul we are nothing; there is not even the name of a
human being, only that of a carcase. If, then, we are ignorant of the soul, it is in fact the soul
that is ignorant of itself. Thus the only remaining question left for us to look into is,
whether the soul was in this matter so ignorant of itself that it became known in any way it
could.7107 The soul, in my opinion,7108 is sensual.7109 Nothing, therefore, pertaining to the
soul is unconnected with sense,7110 nothing pertaining to sense is unconnected with the
soul.7111 And if I may use the expression for the sake of emphasis, I would say, “Animoe
anima sensus est”—“Sense is the soul’s very soul.” Now, since it is the soul that imparts the
faculty of perception7112 to all (that have sense), and since it is itself that perceives the very
senses, not to say properties, of them all, how is it likely that it did not itself receive sense
as its own natural constitution? Whence is it to know what is necessary for itself under given
circumstances, from the very necessity of natural causes, if it knows not its own property,
and what is necessary for it? To recognise this indeed is within the competence of every
soul; it has, I mean, a practical knowledge of itself, without which knowledge of itself no
soul could possibly have exercised its own functions.7113 I suppose, too, that it is especially
suitable that man, the only rational animal, should have been furnished with such a soul as
would make him the rational animal, itself being pre-eminently rational. Now, how can that
soul which makes man a rational animal be itself rational if it be itself ignorant of its ration-

ality, being ignorant of its own very self? So far, however, is it from being ignorant, that it
knows its own Author, its own Master, and its own condition. Before it learns anything
about God, it names the name of God. Before it acquires any knowledge of His judgment,
it professes to commend itself to God. There is nothing one oftener hears of than that there
is no hope after death; and yet what imprecations or deprecations does not the soul use according
as the man dies after a well or ill spent life! These reflections are more fully pursued
in a short treatise which we have written, “On the Testimony of the Soul.”7114 Besides, if the
soul was ignorant of itself from the beginning, there is nothing it could7115 have learnt of
Christ except its own quality.7116 It was not its own form that it learnt of Christ, but its salvation.
For this cause did the Son of God descend and take on Him a soul, not that the soul
might discover itself in Christ, but Christ in itself. For its salvation is endangered, not by its
being ignorant of itself, but of the word of God. “The life,” says He, “was manifested,”7117
not the soul. And again, “I am come to save the soul.” He did not say, “to explain”7118 it.
We could not know, of course,7119 that the soul, although an invisible essence, is born and
dies, unless it were exhibited corporeally. We certainly were ignorant that it was to rise again
with the flesh. This is the truth which it will be found was manifested by Christ. But even
this He did not manifest in Himself in a different way than in some Lazarus, whose flesh
was no more composed of soul7120 than his soul was of flesh.7121 What further knowledge,
therefore, have we received of the structure7122 of the soul which we were ignorant of before?
What invisible part was there belonging to it which wanted to be made visible by the flesh?</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—Christ’s Human Nature. The Flesh and the Soul Both Fully and
Unconfusedly Contained in It.</head>
<p>The soul became flesh that the soul might become visible.7123 Well, then, did the flesh
likewise become soul that the flesh might be manifested?7124 If the soul is flesh, it is no
longer soul, but flesh. If the flesh is soul, it is no longer flesh, but soul. Where, then, there
is flesh, and where there is soul, it has become both one and the other.7125 Now, if they are
neither in particular, although they become both one and the other, it is, to say the least,
very absurd, that we should understand the soul when we name the flesh, and when we indicate
the soul, explain ourselves as meaning the flesh. All things will be in danger of being
taken in a sense different from their own proper sense, and, whilst taken in that different
sense, of losing their proper one, if they are called by a name which differs from their natural
designation. Fidelity in names secures the safe appreciation of properties. When these
properties undergo a change, they are considered to possess such qualities as their names
indicate. Baked clay, for instance, receives the name of brick.7126 It retains not the name
which designated its former state,7127 because it has no longer a share in that state. Therefore,
also, the soul of Christ having become flesh,7128 cannot be anything else than that which it
has become nor can it be any longer that which it once was, having become indeed7129
something else. And since we have just had recourse to an illustration, we will put it to further
use. Our pitcher, then, which was formed of the clay, is one body, and has one name indicative,
of course, of that one body; nor can the pitcher be also called clay, because what it
once was, it is no longer. Now that which is no longer (what it was) is also not an inseparable
property.7130 And the soul is not an inseparable property. Since, therefore, it has become
flesh, the soul is a uniform solid body; it is also a wholly incomplex being,7131 and an indivisible
substance. But in Christ we find the soul and the flesh expressed in simple unfigurative7132
terms; that is to say, the soul is called soul, and the flesh, flesh; nowhere is the soul
termed flesh, or the flesh, soul; and yet they ought to have been thus (confusedly) named if

such had been their condition. The fact, however, is that even by Christ Himself each substance
has been separately mentioned by itself, conformably of course, to the distinction which
exists between the properties of both, the soul by itself, and the flesh by itself. “My soul,”
says He, “is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death;”7133 and “the bread that I will give is my
flesh, (which I will give) for the life7134 of the world.”7135 Now, if the soul had been flesh,
there would have only been in Christ the soul composed of flesh, or else the flesh composed
of soul.7136 Since, however, He keeps the species distinct, the flesh and the soul, He shows
them to be two. If two, then they are no longer one; if not one, then the soul is not composed
of flesh, nor the flesh of soul. For the soul-flesh, or the flesh-soul, is but one; unless indeed
He even had some other soul apart from that which was flesh, and bare about another flesh
besides that which was soul. But since He had but one flesh and one soul,—that “soul which
was sorrowful, even unto death,” and that flesh which was the “bread given for the life of the
world,”—the number is unimpaired7137 of two substances distinct in kind, thus excluding
the unique species of the flesh-comprised soul.</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—Christ Took Not on Him an Angelic Nature, But the Human. It Was
Men, Not Angels, Whom He Came to Save.</head>
<p>But Christ, they say, bare7138 (the nature of) an angel. For what reason? The same which
induced Him to become man? Christ, then, was actuated by the motive which led Him to
take human nature. Man’s salvation was the motive, the restoration of that which had perished.
Man had perished; his recovery had become necessary. No such cause, however, existed
for Christ’s taking on Him the nature of angels. For although there is assigned to angels
also perdition in “the fire prepared for the devil and his angels,”7139 yet a restoration is
never promised to them. No charge about the salvation of angels did Christ ever receive
from the Father; and that which the Father neither promised nor commanded, Christ could
not have undertaken. For what object, therefore, did He bear the angelic nature, if it were
not (that He might have it) as a powerful helper7140 wherewithal to execute the salvation
of man? The Son of God, in sooth, was not competent alone to deliver man, whom a solitary
and single serpent had overthrown! There is, then, no longer but one God, but one Saviour,
if there be two to contrive salvation, and one of them in need of the other. But was it His
object indeed to deliver man by an angel? Why, then, come down to do that which He was
about to expedite with an angel’s help? If by an angel’s aid, why come Himself also? If He
meant to do all by Himself, why have an angel too? He has been, it is true, called “the Angel
of great counsel,” that is, a messenger, by a term expressive of official function, not of nature.
For He had to announce to the world the mighty purpose of the Father, even that which
ordained the restoration of man. But He is not on this account to be regarded as an angel,
as a Gabriel or a Michael. For the Lord of the Vineyard sends even His Son to the labourers
to require fruit, as well as His servants. Yet the Son will not therefore be counted as one of
the servants because He undertook the office of a servant. I may, then, more easily say, if
such an expression is to be hazarded,7141 that the Son is actually an angel, that is, a messenger,
from the Father, than that there is an angel in the Son. Forasmuch, however, as it has been
declared concerning the Son Himself, “Thou hast made Him a little lower than the angels”7142
how will it appear that He put on the nature of angels if He was made lower than the angels,
having become man, with flesh and soul as the Son of man? As “the Spirit7143 of God,”
however, and “the Power of the Highest,”7144 can He be regarded as lower than the an-

gels,—He who is verily God, and the Son of God? Well, but as bearing human nature, He
is so far made inferior to the angels; but as bearing angelic nature, He to the same degree
loses that inferiority. This opinion will be very suitable for Ebion,7145 who holds Jesus to
be a mere man, and nothing more than a descendant of David, and not also the Son of God;
although He is, to be sure,7146 in one respect more glorious than the prophets, inasmuch
as he declares that there was an angel in Him, just as there was in Zechariah. Only it was
never said by Christ, “And the angel, which spake within me, said unto me.”7147 Neither,
indeed, was ever used by Christ that familiar phrase of all the prophets, “Thus saith the
Lord.” For He was Himself the Lord, who openly spake by His own authority, prefacing His
words with the formula, “Verily, verily, I say unto you.” What need is there of further argument?

Himself who saved them.”7148</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—The Valentinian Figment of Christ’s Flesh Being of a Spiritual Nature,
Examined and Refuted Out of Scripture.</head>
<p>Valentinus, indeed, on the strength of his heretical system, might consistently devise a
spiritual flesh for Christ. Any one who refused to believe that that flesh was human might
pretend it to be anything he liked, forasmuch as (and this remark is applicable to all heretics),
if it was not human, and was not born of man, I do not see of what substance Christ Himself
spoke when He called Himself man and the Son of man, saying: “But now ye seek to kill me,
a man that hath told you the truth;”7149 and “The Son of man is Lord of the Sabbath-day.”7150
For it is of Him that Isaiah writes: “A man of suffering, and acquainted with the bearing of
weakness;”7151 and Jeremiah: “He is a man, and who hath known Him?”7152 and Daniel:
“Upon the clouds (He came) as the Son of man.”7153 The Apostle Paul likewise says: “The
man Christ Jesus is the one Mediator between God and man.”7154 Also Peter, in the Acts
of the Apostles, speaks of Him as verily human (when he says), “Jesus Christ was a man
approved of God among you.”7155 These passages alone ought to suffice as a prescriptive7156
testimony in proof that Christ had human flesh derived from man, and not spiritual, and
that His flesh was not composed of soul,7157 nor of stellar substance, and that it was not an
imaginary flesh; (and no doubt they would be sufficient) if heretics could only divest
themselves of all their contentious warmth and artifice. For, as I have read in some writer
of Valentinus’ wretched faction,7158 they refuse at the outset to believe that a human and
earthly substance was created7159 for Christ, lest the Lord should be regarded as inferior to
the angels, who are not formed of earthly flesh; whence, too, it would be necessary that, if
His flesh were like ours, it should be similarly born, not of the Spirit, nor of God, but of the
will of man. Why, moreover, should it be born, not of corruptible [seed], but of incorruptible?
Why, again, since His flesh has both risen and returned to heaven, is not ours, being like
His, also taken up at once? Or else, why does not His flesh, since it is like ours, return in like

manner to the ground, and suffer dissolution? Such objections even the heathen used constantly
to bandy about.7160 Was the Son of God reduced to such a depth of degradation?
Again, if He rose again as a precedent for our hope, how is it that nothing like it has been
thought desirable (to happen) to ourselves?7161 Such views are not improper for heathens
and they are fit and natural for the heretics too. For, indeed, what difference is there between
them, except it be that the heathen, in not believing, do believe; while the heretics, in believing,
do not believe? Then, again, they read: “Thou madest Him a little less than angels;”7162
and they deny the lower nature of that Christ who declares Himself to be, “not a man, but
a worm;”7163 who also had “no form nor comeliness, but His form was ignoble, despised
more than all men, a man in suffering, and acquainted with the bearing of weakness.”7164
Here they discover a human being mingled with a divine one and so they deny the manhood.
They believe that He died, and maintain that a being which has died was born of an incorruptible
substance;7165 as if, forsooth, corruptibility7166 were something else than death!
But our flesh, too, ought immediately to have risen again. Wait a while. Christ has not yet
subdued His enemies, so as to be able to triumph over them in company with His friends.</p>

<p>The famous Alexander,7167 too, instigated by his love of disputation in the true fashion
of heretical temper, has made himself conspicuous against us; he will have us say that Christ
put on flesh of an earthly origin,7168 in order that He might in His own person abolish sinful
flesh.7169 Now, even if we did assert this as our opinion, we should be able to defend it in
such a way as completely to avoid the extravagant folly which he ascribes to us in making
us suppose that the very flesh of Christ was in Himself abolished as being sinful; because
we mention our belief (in public),7170 that it is sitting at the right hand of the Father in
heaven; and we further declare that it will come again from thence in all the pomp7171 of
the Father’s glory: it is therefore just as impossible for us to say that it is abolished, as it is
for us to maintain that it is sinful, and so made void, since in it there has been no fault. We
maintain, moreover, that what has been abolished in Christ is not carnem peccati, “sinful
flesh,” but peccatum carnis, “sin in the flesh,”—not the material thing, but its condition;7172
not the substance, but its flaw;7173 and (this we aver) on the authority of the apostle, who
says, “He abolished sin in the flesh.”7174 Now in another sentence he says that Christ was

of the flesh,” in the sense of a semblance of body instead of its reality; but he means us to
understand likeness to the flesh which sinned,7176 because the flesh of Christ, which committed
no sin itself, resembled that which had sinned,—resembled it in its nature, but not
in the corruption it received from Adam; whence we also affirm that there was in Christ the
same flesh as that whose nature in man is sinful. In the flesh, therefore, we say that sin has
been abolished, because in Christ that same flesh is maintained without sin, which in man
was not maintained without sin. Now, it would not contribute to the purpose of Christ’s
abolishing sin in the flesh, if He did not abolish it in that flesh in which was the nature of
sin, nor (would it conduce) to His glory. For surely it would have been no strange thing if
He had removed the stain of sin in some better flesh, and one which should possess a different,
even a sinless, nature! Then, you say, if He took our flesh, Christ’s was a sinful one. Do
not, however, fetter with mystery a sense which is quite intelligible. For in putting on our
flesh, He made it His own; in making it His own, He made it sinless. A word of caution,
however, must be addressed to all who refuse to believe that our flesh was in Christ on the
ground that it came not of the seed of a human father,7177 let them remember that Adam
himself received this flesh of ours without the seed of a human father. As earth was converted
into this flesh of ours without the seed of a human father, so also was it quite possible for
the Son of God to take to Himself7178 the substance of the selfsame flesh, without a human
father’s agency.7179</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.—The Similarity of Circumstances Between the First and the Second
Adam, as to the Derivation of Their Flesh. An Analogy Also Pleasantly Traced
Between Eve and the Virgin Mary.</head>
<p>But, leaving Alexander with his syllogisms, which he so perversely applies in his discussions,
as well as with the hymns of Valentinus, which, with consummate assurance, he interpolates
as the production of some respectable7180 author, let us confine our inquiry to a
single point—Whether Christ received flesh from the virgin?—that we may thus arrive at
a certain proof that His flesh was human, if He derived its substance from His mother’s
womb, although we are at once furnished with clear evidences of the human character of
His flesh, from its name and description as that of a man, and from the nature of its constitution,
and from the system of its sensations, and from its suffering of death. Now, it will
first be necessary to show what previous reason there was for the Son of God’s being born
of a virgin. He who was going to consecrate a new order of birth, must Himself be born after
a novel fashion, concerning which Isaiah foretold how that the Lord Himself would give
the sign. What, then, is the sign? “Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son.”7181 Accordingly,
a virgin did conceive and bear “Emmanuel, God with us.”7182 This is the new nativity;
a man is born in God. And in this man God was born, taking the flesh of an ancient race,
without the help, however, of the ancient seed, in order that He might reform it with a new
seed, that is, in a spiritual manner, and cleanse it by the re-moval of all its ancient stains.
But the whole of this new birth was prefigured, as was the case in all other instances, in ancient
type, the Lord being born as man by a dispensation in which a virgin was the medium.
The earth was still in a virgin state, reduced as yet by no human labour, with no seed as yet
cast into its furrows, when, as we are told, God made man out of it into a living soul.7183
As, then, the first Adam is thus introduced to us, it is a just inference that the second Adam
likewise, as the apostle has told us, was formed by God into a quickening spirit out of the
ground,—in other words, out of a flesh which was unstained as yet by any human generation.
But that I may lose no opportunity of supporting my argument from the name of Adam,
why is Christ called Adam by the apostle, unless it be that, as man, He was of that earthly
origin? And even reason here maintains the same conclusion, because it was by just the
contrary7184 operation that God recovered His own image and likeness, of which He had
been robbed by the devil. For it was while Eve was yet a virgin, that the ensnaring word had

crept into her ear which was to build the edifice of death. Into a virgin’s soul, in like manner,
must be introduced that Word of God which was to raise the fabric of life; so that what had
been reduced to ruin by this sex, might by the selfsame sex be recovered to salvation. As
Eve had believed the serpent, so Mary believed the angel.7185 The delinquency which the
one occasioned by believing, the other by believing effaced. But (it will be said) Eve did not
at the devil’s word conceive in her womb. Well, she at all events conceived; for the devil’s
word afterwards became as seed to her that she should conceive as an outcast, and bring
forth in sorrow. Indeed she gave birth to a fratricidal devil; whilst Mary, on the contrary,
bare one who was one day to secure salvation to Israel, His own brother after the flesh, and
the murderer of Himself. God therefore sent down into the virgin’s womb His Word, as the
good Brother, who should blot out the memory of the evil brother. Hence it was necessary
that Christ should come forth for the salvation of man, in that condition of flesh into which
man had entered ever since his condemnation.</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—The Mystery of the Assumption of Our Perfect Human Nature by
the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity. He is Here Called, as Often Elsewhere,
the Spirit.</head>
<p>Now, that we may give a simpler answer, it was not fit that the Son of God should be
born of a human father’s seed, lest, if He were wholly the Son of a man, He should fail to be
also the Son of God, and have nothing more than “a Solomon” or “a Jonas,”7186—as Ebion7187
thought we ought to believe concerning Him. In order, therefore, that He who was already
the Son of God—of God the Father’s seed, that is to say, the Spirit—might also be the Son
of man, He only wanted to assume flesh, of the flesh of man7188 without the seed of a
man;7189 for the seed of a man was unnecessary7190 for One who had the seed of God. As,
then, before His birth of the virgin, He was able to have God for His Father without a human
mother, so likewise, after He was born of the virgin, He was able to have a woman for His
mother without a human father. He is thus man with God, in short, since He is man’s flesh
with God’s Spirit7191—flesh (I say) without seed from man, Spirit with seed from God. For
as much, then, as the dispensation of God’s purpose7192 concerning His Son required that
He should be born7193 of a virgin, why should He not have received of the virgin the body
which He bore from the virgin? Because, (forsooth) it is something else which He took from
God, for “the Word” say they, “was made flesh.”7194 Now this very statement plainly shows
what it was that was made flesh; nor can it possibly be that7195 anything else than the Word
was made flesh. Now, whether it was of the flesh that the Word was made flesh, or whether
it was so made of the (divine) seed itself, the Scripture must tell us. As, however, the Scripture
is silent about everything except what it was that was made (flesh), and says nothing of that
from which it was so made, it must be held to suggest that from something else, and not
from itself, was the Word made flesh. And if not from itself, but from something else, from
what can we more suitably suppose that the Word became flesh than from that flesh in

in the fact) that the Lord Himself sententiously and distinctly pronounced, “that which is
born of the flesh is flesh,”7197 even because it is born of the flesh. But if He here spoke of a
human being simply, and not of Himself, (as you maintain) then you must deny absolutely
that Christ is man, and must maintain that human nature was not suitable to Him. And
then He adds, “That which is born of the Spirit is spirit,”7198 because God is a Spirit, and
He was born of God. Now this description is certainly even more applicable to Him than it
is to those who believe in Him. But if this passage indeed apply to Him, then why does not
the preceding one also? For you cannot divide their relation, and adapt this to Him, and the
previous clause to all other men, especially as you do not deny that Christ possesses the two
substances, both of the flesh and of the Spirit. Besides, as He was in possession both of flesh
and of Spirit, He cannot possibly, when speaking of the condition of the two substances
which He Himself bears, be supposed to have determined that the Spirit indeed was His
own, but that the flesh was not His own. Forasmuch, therefore, as He is of the Spirit He is
God the Spirit, and is born of God; just as He is also born of the flesh of man, being generated
in the flesh as man.7199</p>

Not by Carnal Conception, Nor by the Will of the Flesh and of Man, But by the
Will of God. Christ’s Divine Nature, of Its Own Accord, Descended into the
Virgin’s Womb.</head>
<p>What, then, is the meaning of this passage, “Born7200 not of blood, nor of the will of
the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God?”7201 I shall make more use of this passage after
I have confuted those who have tampered with it. They maintain that it was written thus
(in the plural)7202 “Who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will
of man, but of God,” as if designating those who were before mentioned as “believing in
His name,” in order to point out the existence of that mysterious seed of the elect and spir-
itual which they appropriate to themselves.7203 But how can this be, when all who believe
in the name of the Lord are, by reason of the common principle of the human race, born of
blood, and of the will of the flesh, and of man, as indeed is Valentinus himself? The expression
is in the singular number, as referring to the Lord, “He was born of God.” And very properly,
because Christ is the Word of God, and with the Word the Spirit of God, and by the Spirit
the Power of God, and whatsoever else appertains to God. As flesh, however, He is not of
blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of man, because it was by the will of God that the
Word was made flesh. To the flesh, indeed, and not to the Word, accrues the denial of the
nativity which is natural to us all as men,7204 because it was as flesh that He had thus to be
born, and not as the Word. Now, whilst the passage actually denies that He was born of the
will of the flesh, how is it that it did not also deny (that He was born) of the substance of
the flesh? For it did not disavow the substance of the flesh when it denied His being “born
of blood” but only the matter of the seed, which, as all know, is the warm blood as convected
by ebullition7205 into the coagulum of the woman’s blood. In the cheese, it is from the coagulation
that the milky substance acquires that consistency,7206 which is condensed by
infusing the rennet.7207 We thus understand that what is denied is the Lord’s birth after

sexual intercourse (as is suggested by the phrase, “the will of man and of the flesh”), not His
nativity from a woman’s womb. Why, too, is it insisted on with such an accumulation of
emphasis that He was not born of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor (of the will) of man,
if it were not that His flesh was such that no man could have any doubt on the point of its
being born from sexual intercourse? Again, although denying His birth from such cohabitation,
the passage did not deny that He was born of real flesh; it rather affirmed this, by the
very fact that it did not deny His birth in the flesh in the same way that it denied His birth
from sexual intercourse. Pray, tell me, why the Spirit of God7208 descended into a woman’s
womb at all, if He did not do so for the purpose of partaking of flesh from the womb. For
He could have become spiritual flesh7209 without such a process,—much more simply, indeed,
without the womb than in it. He had no reason for enclosing Himself within one, if He was
to bear forth nothing from it. Not without reason, however, did He descend into a womb.
Therefore He received (flesh) therefrom; else, if He received nothing therefrom, His descent
into it would have been without a reason, especially if He meant to become flesh of that sort
which was not derived from a womb, that is to say, a spiritual one.7210</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—Christ Born of a Virgin, of Her Substance. The Physiological Facts
of His Real and Exact Birth of a Human Mother, as Suggested by Certain Passages
of Scripture.</head>
<p>But to what shifts you resort, in your attempt to rob the syllable ex (of)7211 of its proper
force as a preposition, and to substitute another for it in a sense not found throughout the
Holy Scriptures! You say that He was born through7212 a virgin, not of7213 a virgin, and in
a womb, not of a womb, because the angel in the dream said to Joseph, “That which is born
in her” (not of her) “is of the Holy Ghost.”7214 But the fact is, if he had meant “of her,” he
must have said “in her;” for that which was of her, was also in her. The angel’s expression,
therefore, “in her,” has precisely the same meaning as the phrase “of her.” It is, however, a
fortunate circumstance that Matthew also, when tracing down the Lord’s descent from
Abraham to Mary, says, “Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born
Christ.”7215 But Paul, too, silences these critics7216 when he says, “God sent forth His Son,
made of a woman.”7217 Does he mean through a woman, or in a woman? Nay more, for the
sake of greater emphasis, he uses the word “made” rather than born, although the use of the
latter expression would have been simpler. But by saying “made,” he not only confirmed
the statement, “The Word was made flesh,”7218 but he also asserted the reality of the flesh
which was made of a virgin. We shall have also the support of the Psalms on this point, not
the “Psalms” indeed of Valentinus the apostate, and heretic, and Platonist, but the Psalms
of David, the most illustrious saint and well-known prophet. He sings to us of Christ, and
through his voice Christ indeed also sang concerning Himself. Hear, then, Christ the Lord
speaking to God the Father: “Thou art He that didst draw7219 me out of my mother’s
womb.”7220 Here is the first point. “Thou art my hope from my mother’s breasts; upon Thee
have I been cast from the womb.”7221 Here is another point. “Thou art my God from my
mother’s belly.”7222 Here is a third point. Now let us carefully attend to the sense of these

passages. “Thou didst draw me,” He says, “out of the womb.” Now what is it which is drawn,
if it be not that which adheres, that which is firmly fastened to anything from which it is
drawn in order to be sundered? If He clove not to the womb, how could He have been drawn
from it? If He who clove thereto was drawn from it, how could He have adhered to it, if it
were not that, all the while He was in the womb, He was tied to it, as to His origin,7223 by
the umbilical cord, which communicated growth to Him from the matrix? Even when one
strange matter amalgamates with another, it becomes so entirely incorporated7224 with that
with which it amalgamates, that when it is drawn off from it, it carries with it some part of
the body from which it is torn, as if in consequence of the severance of the union and growth
which the constituent pieces had communicated to each other. But what were His “mother’s
breasts” which He mentions? No doubt they were those which He sucked. Midwives, and
doctors, and naturalists, can tell us, from the nature of women’s breasts, whether they usually
flow at any other time than when the womb is affected with pregnancy, when the veins
convey therefrom the blood of the lower parts7225 to the mamilla, and in the act of transference
convert the secretion into the nutritious7226 substance of milk. Whence it comes to
pass that during the period of lactation the monthly issues are suspended. But if the Word
was made flesh of Himself without any communication with a womb, no mother’s womb
operating upon Him with its usual function and support, how could the lacteal fountain
have been conveyed (from the womb) to the breasts, since (the womb) can only effect the
change by actual possession of the proper substance? But it could not possibly have had blood
for transformation into milk, unless it possessed the causes of blood also, that is to say, the
severance (by birth)7227 of its own flesh from the mother’s womb. Now it is easy to see what
was the novelty of Christ’s being born of a virgin. It was simply this, that (He was born) of
a virgin in the real manner which we have indicated, in order that our regeneration might
have virginal purity,—spiritually cleansed from all pollutions through Christ, who was
Himself a virgin, even in the flesh, in that He was born of a virgin’s flesh.</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—The Word of God Did Not Become Flesh Except in the Virgin’s
Womb and of Her Substance. Through His Mother He is Descended from Her
Great Ancestor David. He is Described Both in the Old and in the New Testament
as “The Fruit of David’s Loins.”</head>
<p>Whereas, then, they contend that the novelty (of Christ’s birth) consisted in this, that
as the Word of God became flesh without the seed of a human father, so there should be no
flesh of the virgin mother (assisting in the transaction), why should not the novelty rather
be confined to this, that His flesh, although not born of seed, should yet have proceeded
from flesh? I should like to go more closely into this discussion. “Behold,” says he, “a virgin
shall conceive in the womb.”7228 Conceive what? I ask. The Word of God, of course, and
not the seed of man, and in order, certainly, to bring forth a son. “For,” says he, “she shall
bring forth a son.”7229 Therefore, as the act of conception was her own,7230 so also what
she brought forth was her own, also, although the cause of conception7231 was not. If, on
the other hand, the Word became flesh of Himself, then He both conceived and brought
forth Himself, and the prophecy is stultified. For in that case a virgin did not conceive, and
did not bring forth; since whatever she brought forth from the conception of the Word, is
not her own flesh. But is this the only statement of prophecy which will be frustrated?7232
Will not the angel’s announcement also be subverted, that the virgin should “conceive in
her womb and bring forth a son?”7233 And will not in fact every scripture which declares
that Christ had a mother? For how could she have been His mother, unless He had been in
her womb? But then He received nothing from her womb which could make her a mother
in whose womb He had been.7234 Such a name as this7235 a strange flesh ought not to assume.
No flesh can speak of a mother’s womb but that which is itself the offspring of that womb;
nor can any be the offspring of the said womb if it owe its birth solely to itself. Therefore
even Elisabeth must be silent although she is carrying in her womb the prophetic babe,
which was already conscious of his Lord, and is, moreover, filled with the Holy Ghost.7236
For without reason does she say, “and whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord

should come to me?”7237 If it was not as her son, but only as a stranger that Mary carried
Jesus in her womb, how is it she says, “Blessed is the fruit of thy womb”?7238 What is this
fruit of the womb, which received not its germ from the womb, which had not its root in
the womb, which belongs not to her whose is the womb, and which is no doubt the real fruit
of the womb—even Christ? Now, since He is the blossom of the stem which sprouts from
the root of Jesse; since, moreover, the root of Jesse is the family of David, and the stem of
the root is Mary descended from David, and the blossom of the stem is Mary’s son, who is
called Jesus Christ, will not He also be the fruit? For the blossom is the fruit, because through
the blossom and from the blossom every product advances from its rudimental condition7239
to perfect fruit. What then? They, deny to the fruit its blossom, and to the blossom its stem,
and to the stem its root; so that the root fails to secure7240 for itself, by means of the stem,
that special product which comes from the stem, even the blossom and the fruit; for every
step indeed in a genealogy is traced from the latest up to the first, so that it is now a wellknown
fact that the flesh of Christ is inseparable,7241 not merely from Mary, but also from
David through Mary, and from Jesse through David. “This fruit,” therefore, “of David’s
loins,” that is to say, of his posterity in the flesh, God swears to him that “He will raise up
to sit upon his throne.”7242 If “of David’s loins,” how much rather is He of Mary’s loins, by
virtue of whom He is in “the loins of David?”</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—Holy Scripture in the New Testament, Even in Its Very First Verse,
Testifies to Christ’s True Flesh. In Virtue of Which He is Incorporated in the
Human Stock of David, and Abraham, and Adam.</head>
<p>They may, then, obliterate the testimony of the devils which proclaimed Jesus the son
of David; but whatever unworthiness there be in this testimony, that of the apostles they
will never be able to efface. There is, first of all, Matthew, that most faithful chronicler7243
of the Gospel, because the companion of the Lord; for no other reason in the world than to
show us clearly the fleshly original7244 of Christ, he thus begins his Gospel: “The book of
the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.”7245 With a nature
issuing from such fountal sources, and an order gradually descending to the birth of Christ,
what else have we here described than the very flesh of Abraham and of David conveying
itself down, step after step, to the very virgin, and at last introducing Christ,—nay, producing
Christ Himself of the virgin? Then, again, there is Paul, who was at once both a disciple,
and a master, and a witness of the selfsame Gospel; as an apostle of the same Christ, also,
he affirms that Christ “was made of the seed of David, according to the flesh,”7246—which,
therefore, was His own likewise. Christ’s flesh, then, is of David’s seed. Since He is of the
seed of David in consequence of Mary’s flesh, He is therefore of Mary’s flesh because of the
seed of David. In what way so ever you torture the statement, He is either of the flesh of
Mary because of the seed of David, or He is of the seed of David because of the flesh of Mary.
The whole discussion is terminated by the same apostle, when he declares Christ to be “the
seed of Abraham.” And if of Abraham, how much more, to be sure, of David, as a more recent
progenitor! For, unfolding the promised blessing upon all nations in the person7247 of Abraham,
“And in thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed,” he adds, “He saith not,
And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.”7248 When we
read and believe these things, what sort of flesh ought we, and can we, acknowledge in
Christ? Surely none other than Abraham’s, since Christ is “the seed of Abraham;” none
other than Jesse’s, since Christ is the blossom of “the stem of Jesse;” none other than David’s,
since Christ is “the fruit of David’s loins;” none other than Mary’s, since Christ came from
Mary’s womb; and, higher still, none other than Adam’s, since Christ is “the second Adam.”

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Simeon’s “Sign that Should Be Contradicted,” Applied to the
Heretical Gainsaying of the True Birth of Christ. One of the Heretics’ Paradoxes
Turned in Support of Catholic Truth.</head>
<p>We acknowledge, however, that the prophetic declaration of Simeon is fulfilled, which
he spoke over the recently-born Saviour:7250 “Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising
again of many in Israel, and for a sign that shall be spoken against.”7251 The sign (here
meant) is that of the birth of Christ, according to Isaiah: “Therefore the Lord Himself shall
give you a sign: behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son.”7252 We discover, then, what
the sign is which is to be spoken against—the conception and the parturition of the Virgin
Mary, concerning which these sophists7253 say: “She a virgin and yet not a virgin bare, and
yet did not bear;” just as if such language, if indeed it must be uttered, would not be more
suitable even for ourselves to use! For “she bare,” because she produced offspring of her
own flesh and “yet she did not bear,” since she produced Him not from a husband’s seed;
she was “a virgin,” so far as (abstinence) from a husband went, and “yet not a virgin,” as
regards her bearing a child. There is not, however, that parity of reasoning which the heretics
affect: in other words it does not follow that for the reason “she did not bear,”7254 she who
was “not a virgin” was “yet a virgin,” even because she became a mother without any fruit
of her own womb. But with us there is no equivocation, nothing twisted into a double
sense.7255 Light is light; and darkness, darkness; yea is yea; and nay, nay; “whatsoever is
more than these cometh of evil.”7256 She who bare (really) bare; and although she was a
virgin when she conceived, she was a wife7257 when she brought forth her son. Now, as a
wife, she was under the very law of “opening the womb,”7258 wherein it was quite immaterial
whether the birth of the male was by virtue of a husband’s co-operation or not;7259 it
was the same sex7260 that opened her womb. Indeed, hers is the womb on account of which
it is written of others also: “Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the

Lord.”7261 For who is really holy but the Son of God? Who properly opened the womb but
He who opened a closed one?7262 But it is marriage which opens the womb in all cases. The
virgin’s womb, therefore, was especially7263 opened, because it was especially closed. Indeed7264
she ought rather to be called not a virgin than a virgin, becoming a mother at a
leap, as it were, before she was a wife. And what must be said more on this point? Since it
was in this sense that the apostle declared that the Son of God was born not of a virgin, but
“of a woman,” he in that statement recognised the condition of the “opened womb” which
ensues in marriage.7265 We read in Ezekiel of “a heifer7266 which brought forth, and still
did not bring forth.” Now, see whether it was not in view of your own future contentions
about the womb of Mary, that even then the Holy Ghost set His mark upon you in this
passage; otherwise7267 He would not, contrary to His usual simplicity of style (in this
prophet), have uttered a sentence of such doubtful import, especially when Isaiah says, “She

Jesus Christ, Both God and Man, Thus Condemned.</head>
<p>For when Isaiah hurls denunciation against our very heretics, especially in his “Woe to
them that call evil good, and put darkness for light,”7269 he of course sets his mark upon
those amongst you7270 who preserve not in the words they employ the light of their true
significance, (by taking care) that the soul should mean only that which is so called, and the
flesh simply that which is confest to our view, and God none other than the One who is
preached.7271 Having thus Marcion in his prophetic view, he says, “I am God, and there is
none else; there is no God beside me.”7272 And when in another passage he says, in like
manner, “Before me there was no God,”7273 he strikes at those inexplicable genealogies of
the Valentinian Æons. Again, there is an answer to Ebion in the Scripture: “Born,7274 not
of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.” In like manner, in
the passage, “If even an angel of heaven preach unto you any other gospel than that which
we have preached unto you, let him be anathema,”7275 he calls attention to the artful influence
of Philumene,7276 the virgin friend of Apelles. Surely he is antichrist who denies that Christ
has come in the flesh.7277 By declaring that His flesh is simply and absolutely true, and taken
in the plain sense of its own nature, the Scripture aims a blow at all who make distinctions
in it.7278 In the same way, also, when it defines the very Christ to be but one, it shakes the
fancies of those who exhibit a multiform Christ, who make Christ to be one being and Jesus
another,—representing one as escaping out of the midst of the crowds, and the other as
detained by them; one as appearing on a solitary mountain to three companions, clothed

<head>Chapter XXV.—Conclusion. This Treatise Forms a Preface to the Other Work, “On
the Resurrection of the Flesh,” Proving the Reality of the Flesh Which Was Truly
Born, and Died, and Rose Again.</head>
<p>But let this suffice on our present subject; for I think that by this time proof enough has
been adduced of the flesh in Christ having both been born of the virgin, and being human
in its nature. And this discussion alone might have been sufficient, without encountering
the isolated opinions which have been raised from different quarters. We have, however,
challenged these opinions to the test, both of the arguments which sustain them, and of the
Scriptures which are appealed to, and this we have done ex abundanti; so that we have, by
showing what the flesh of Christ was, and whence it was derived, also predetermined the
question, against all objectors, of what that flesh was not. The resurrection, however, of our
own flesh will have to be maintained in another little treatise, and so bring to a close this
present one, which serves as a general preface, and which will pave the way for the approaching
subject now that it is plain what kind of body that was which rose again in Christ.</p>

<head>Elucidations.</head>

<p>I.
(In the body of a dove, cap. iii. p. 523.)</p>
<p>The learned John Scott, in his invaluable work The Christian Life,7283 identifies the
glory shed upon the Saviour at his baptism, with that mentioned by Ezekiel (Cap. xliii. 2)
and adds: “In this same glorious splendor was Christ arrayed first at his Baptism and afterward
at his Transfiguration.…By the Holy Ghost’s descending like a Dove, it is not necessary
we should understand his descending in the shape or form of a Dove, but that in some
glorious form, or appearance, he descended in the same manner as a Dove descends.…Came
down from above just as a dove with his wings spread forth is observed to do, and lighted
upon our Saviour’s head.” I quote this as the opinion of one of the most learned and orthodox
of divines, but not as my own, for I cannot reconcile it, as he strives to do, with St. Luke iii.
22. Compare Justin Martyr, vol. i. p. 243, and note 6, this series. Grotius observes, says Dr.
Scott, that in the apocryphal Gospel of the Nazarenes, it is said that at the Baptism of our
Lord “a great light shone round about the place.”</p>

 <p>II.
(His mother and His brethren, cap. vii. p. 527.)</p>
<p>It is not possible that the author of this chapter had ever conceived of the Blessed Virgin
otherwise than as “Blessed among women,” indeed, but enjoying no especial prerogative as
the mother of our Lord. He speaks of “denying her” and “putting her away” after He began
His Ministry, as He requires His ministers to do, after His example. How extraordinary this
language—“the repudiation of carnal relationship.” According to our author, never charged
with heresy on this point, the high rewards of the holy Mary, in the world to come will be
those due to her faith, not to the blessing of “her breasts and of her womb.” Christ designates
those as “more blessed,” who hear His word and keep it. This the Blessed Virgin did preeminently,
and herein was her own greater blessedness; that is, (our author shews) her crown
of glory depends chiefly, like that of other saints, on her faith and works, not on her mere
Maternity.</p>

On the Resurrection of the Flesh.</head>
<p>The heretics against whom this work is directed, were the same
who maintained that the demiurge, or the god who created this world
and gave the Mosaic dispensation, was opposed to the supreme God.
Hence they attached an idea of inherent corruption and worthlessness
to all his works—amongst the rest, to the flesh or body of man; affirming
that it could not rise again, and that the soul alone was capable of
inheriting immortality.7284</p>

<p>The resurrection of the dead is the Christian’s trust.7285 By it we are believers. To the
belief of this (article of the faith) truth compels us—that truth which God reveals, but the
crowd derides, which supposes that nothing will survive after death. And yet they do honour7286
to their dead, and that too in the most expensive way according to their bequest,
and with the daintiest banquets which the seasons can produce,7287 on the presumption
that those whom they declare to be incapable of all perception still retain an appetite.7288
But (let the crowd deride): I on my side must deride it still more, especially when it burns

up its dead with harshest inhumanity, only to pamper them immediately afterwards with
gluttonous satiety, using the selfsame fires to honour them and to insult them. What piety
is that which mocks its victims with cruelty? Is it sacrifice or insult (which the crowd offers),
when it burns its offerings to those it has already burnt?7289 But the wise, too, join with the
vulgar crowd in their opinion sometimes. There is nothing after death, according to the
school of Epicurus. After death all things come to an end, even death itself, says Seneca to
like effect. It is satisfactory, however, that the no less important philosophy of Pythagoras
and Empedocles, and the Plantonists, take the contrary view, and declare the soul to be
immortal; affirming, moreover, in a way which most nearly approaches (to our own doctrine),
7290 that the soul actually returns into bodies, although not the same bodies, and not
even those of human beings invariably: thus Euphorbus is supposed to have passed into
Phythagoras, and Homer into a peacock. They firmly pronounced the soul’s renewal7291 to
be in a body,7292 (deeming it) more tolerable to change the quality (of the corporeal state)
than to deny it wholly: they at least knocked at the door of truth, although they entered not.
Thus the world, with all its errors, does not ignore the resurrection of the dead.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—The Jewish Sadducees a Link Between the Pagan Philosophers and the
Heretics on This Doctrine. Its Fundamental Importance Asserted. The Soul Fares
Better Than the Body, in Heretical Estimation, as to Its Future State. Its Extinction,
However, Was Held by One Lucan.</head>
<p>Since there is even within the confines of God’s Church7293 a sect which is more nearly
allied to the Epicureans than to the prophets, an opportunity is afforded us of knowing7294
what estimate Christ forms of the (said sect, even the) Sadducees. For to Christ was it reserved
to lay bare everything which before was concealed: to impart certainty to doubtful points;
to accomplish those of which men had had but a foretaste; to give present reality to the objects
of prophecy; and to furnish not only by Himself, but actually in Himself, certain proofs of
the resurrection of the dead. It is, however, against other Sadducees that we have now to
prepare ourselves, but still partakers of their doctrine. For instance, they allow a moiety of
the resurrection; that is, simply of the soul, despising the flesh, just as they also do the Lord
of the flesh Himself. No other persons, indeed, refuse to concede to the substance of the
body its recovery from death,7295 heretical inventors of a second deity. Driven then, as they
are, to give a different dispensation to Christ, so that He may not be accounted as belonging
to the Creator, they have achieved their first error in the article of His very flesh; contending
with Marcion and Basilides that it possessed no reality; or else holding, after the heretical
tenets of Valentinus, and according to Apelles, that it had qualities peculiar to itself. And
so it follows that they shut out from all recovery from death that substance of which they
say that Christ did not partake, confidently assuming that it furnishes the strongest presumption
against the resurrection, since the flesh is already risen in Christ. Hence it is that we
have ourselves previously issued our volume On the flesh of Christ; in which we both furnish
proofs of its reality,7296 in opposition to the idea of its being a vain phantom; and claim for
it a human nature without any peculiarity of condition—such a nature as has marked out
Christ to be both man and the Son of man. For when we prove Him to be invested with the
flesh and in a bodily condition, we at the same time refute heresy, by establishing the rule
that no other being than the Creator must be believed to be God, since we show that Christ,
in whom God is plainly discerned, is precisely of such a nature as the Creator promised that
He should be. Being thus refuted touching God as the Creator, and Christ as the Redeemer
of the flesh, they will at once be defeated also on the resurrection of the flesh. No procedure,
indeed, can be more reasonable. And we affirm that controversy with heretics should in

most cases be conducted in this way. For due method requires that conclusions should always
be drawn from the most important premises, in order that there be a prior agreement on
the essential point, by means of which the particular question under review may be said to
have been determined. Hence it is that the heretics, from their conscious weakness, never
conduct discussion in an orderly manner. They are well aware how hard is their task in insinuating
the existence of a second god, to the disparagement of the Creator of the world,
who is known to all men naturally by the testimony of His works, who is before all others
in the mysteries7297 of His being, and is especially manifested in the prophets;7298 then,
under the pretence of considering a more urgent inquiry, namely man’s own salvation—a
question which transcends all others in its importance—they begin with doubts about the
resurrection; for there is greater difficulty in believing the resurrection of the flesh than the
oneness of the Deity. In this way, after they have deprived the discussion of the advantages
of its logical order, and have embarrassed it with doubtful insinuations7299 in disparagement
of the flesh, they gradually draw their argument to the reception of a second god after destroying
and changing the very ground of our hopes. For when once a man is fallen or removed
from the sure hope which he had placed in the Creator, he is easily led away to the object
of a different hope, whom however of his own accord he can hardly help suspecting. Now
it is by a discrepancy in the promises that a difference of gods is insinuated. How many do
we thus see drawn into the net vanquished on the resurrection of the flesh, before they could
carry their point on the oneness of the Deity! In respect, then, of the heretics, we have shown
with what weapons we ought to meet them. And indeed we have already encountered them
in treatises severally directed against them: on the one only God and His Christ, in our work
against Marcion,7300 on the Lord’s flesh, in our book against the four heresies,7301 for the
special purpose of opening the way to the present inquiry: so that we have now only to discuss
the resurrection of the flesh, (treating it) just as if it were uncertain in regard to ourselves
also, that is, in the system of the Creator.7302 Because many persons are uneducated; still
more are of faltering faith, and several are weak-minded: these will have to be instructed,
directed, strengthened, inasmuch as the very oneness of the Godhead will be defended along

with the maintenance of our doctrine.7303 For if the resurrection of the flesh be denied, that
prime article of the faith is shaken; if it be asserted, that is established. There is no need, I
suppose, to treat of the soul’s safety; for nearly all the heretics, in whatever way they conceive
of it, certainly refrain from denying that. We may ignore a certain Lucan,7304 who does not
spare even this part of our nature, which he follows Aristotle in reducing to dissolution, and
substitutes some other thing in lieu of it. Some third nature it is which, according to him,
is to rise again, neither soul nor flesh; in other words, not man, but a bear perhaps—for instance,
Lucan himself.7305 Even he7306 has received from us a copious notice in our book
on the entire condition of the soul,7307 the especial immortality of which we there maintain,
whilst we also both acknowledge the dissolution of the flesh alone, and emphatically assert
its restitution. Into the body of that work were collected whatever points we elsewhere had
to reserve from the pressure of incidental causes. For as it is my custom to touch some
questions but lightly on their first occurrence, so I am obliged also to postpone the consideration

<head>Chapter III.—Some Truths Held Even by the Heathen. They Were, However, More
Often Wrong Both in Religious Opinions and in Moral Practice. The Heathen
Not to Be Followed in Their Ignorance of the Christian Mystery. The Heretics
Perversely Prone to Follow Them.</head>
<p>One may no doubt be wise in the things of God, even from one’s natural powers, but
only in witness to the truth, not in maintenance of error; (only) when one acts in accordance
with, not in opposition to, the divine dispensation. For some things are known even by
nature: the immortality of the soul, for instance, is held by many; the knowledge of our God
is possessed by all. I may use, therefore, the opinion of a Plato, when he declares, “Every
soul is immortal.” I may use also the conscience of a nation, when it attests the God of gods.
I may, in like manner, use all the other intelligences of our common nature, when they
pronounce God to be a judge. “God sees,” (say they); and, “I commend you to God.”7308
But when they say, “What has undergone death is dead,” and, “Enjoy life whilst you live,”
and, “After death all things come to an end, even death itself;” then I must remember both
that “the heart of man is ashes,”7309 according to the estimate of God, and that the very
“Wisdom of the world is foolishness,” (as the inspired word) pronounces it to be.7310 Then,
if even the heretic seek refuge in the depraved thoughts of the vulgar, or the imaginations
of the world, I must say to him: Part company with the heathen, O heretic! for although you
are all agreed in imagining a God, yet while you do so in the name of Christ, so long as you
deem yourself a Christian, you are a different man from a heathen: give him back his own
views of things, since he does not himself learn from yours. Why lean upon a blind guide,
if you have eyes of your own? Why be clothed by one who is naked, if you have put on
Christ? Why use the shield of another, when the apostle gives you armour of your own? It
would be better for him to learn from you to acknowledge the resurrection of the flesh, than
for you from him to deny it; because if Christians must needs deny it, it would be sufficient
if they did so from their own knowledge, without any instruction from the ignorant multitude.
He, therefore, will not be a Christian who shall deny this doctrine which is confessed
by Christians; denying it, moreover, on grounds which are adopted by a man who is not a
Christian. Take away, indeed, from the heretics the wisdom which they share with the heathen,
and let them support their inquiries from the Scriptures alone: they will then be unable
to keep their ground. For that which commends men’s common sense is its very simplicity,
and its participation in the same feelings, and its community of opinions; and it is deemed
to be all the more trustworthy, inasmuch as its definitive statements are naked and open,

<head>Chapter IV.—Heathens and Heretics Alike in Their Vilification of the Flesh and Its
Functions, the Ordinary Cavils Against the Final Restitution of So Weak and
Ignoble a Substance.</head>
<p>Hence it is that heretics start at once from this point,7311 from which they sketch the
first draft of their dogmas, and afterwards add the details, being well aware how easily men’s
minds are caught by its influence, (and actuated) by that community of human sentiment
which is so favourable to their designs. Is there anything else that you can hear of from the
heretic, as also from the heathen, earlier in time or greater in extent? Is not (their burden)
from the beginning and everywhere an invective against the flesh—against its origin, against
its substance, against the casualties and the invariable end which await it; unclean from its
first formation of the dregs of the ground, uncleaner afterwards from the mire of its own
seminal transmission; worthless,7312 weak, covered with guilt, laden with misery, full of
trouble; and after all this record of its degradation, dropping into its original earth and the
appellation of a corpse, and destined to dwindle away even from this7313 loathsome name
into none henceforth at all—into the very death of all designation? Now you are a shrewd
man, no doubt: will you then persuade yourself, that after this flesh has been withdrawn
from sight, and touch, and memory, it can never be rehabilitated from corruption to integrity,
from a shattered to a solid state, from an empty to a full condition, from nothing at all to
something—the devouring fires, and the waters of the sea, and the maws of beasts, and the
crops of birds and the stomachs of fishes, and time’s own great paunch7314 itself of course
yielding it all up again? Shall the same flesh which has fallen to decay be so expected to recover,
as that the lame, and the one-eyed, and the blind, and the leper, and the palsied shall
come back again, although there can be no pleasure in returning to their old condition? Or
shall they be whole, and so have to fear exposure to such sufferings? What, in that case,
(must we say) of the consequences of resuming the flesh? Will it again be subject to all its
present wants, especially meats and drinks? Shall we have with our lungs to float (in air or
water),7315 and suffer pain in our bowels, and with organs of shame to feel no shame, and
with all our limbs to toil and labour? Must there again be ulcers, and wounds, and fever,
and gout, and once more the wishing to die? Of course these will be the longings incident
on the recovery of the flesh, only the repetition of desires to escape out of it. Well now, we

<head>Chapter V.—Some Considerations in Reply Eulogistic of the Flesh. It Was Created
by God. The Body of Man Was, in Fact, Previous to His Soul.</head>
<p>Inasmuch as all uneducated men, therefore, still form their opinions after these commonsense
views, and as the falterers and the weak-minded have a renewal of their perplexities
occasioned by the selfsame views; and as the first battering-ram which is directed against
ourselves is that which shatters the condition of the flesh, we must on our side necessarily
so manage our defences, as to guard, first of all, the condition of the flesh, their disparagement
of it being repulsed by our own eulogy. The heretics, therefore, challenged us to use our
rhetoric no less than our philosophy. Respecting, then, this frail and poor, worthless body,
which they do not indeed hesitate to call evil, even if it had been the work of angels, as
Menander and Marcus are pleased to think, or the formation of some fiery being, an angel,
as Apelles teaches, it would be quite enough for securing respect for the body, that it had
the support and protection of even a secondary deity. The angels, we know, rank next to
God. Now, whatever be the supreme God of each heretic, I should not unfairly derive the
dignity of the flesh likewise from Him to whom was present the will for its production. For,
of course, if He had not willed its production, He would have prohibited it, when He knew
it was in progress. It follows, then, that even on their principle the flesh is equally the work
of God. There is no work but belongs to Him who has permitted it to exist. It is indeed a
happy circumstance, that most of their doctrines, including even the harshest, accord to
our God the entire formation of man. How mighty He is, you know full well who believe
that He is the only God. Let, then, the flesh begin to give you pleasure, since the Creator
thereof is so great. But, you say, even the world is the work of God, and yet “the fashion of
this world passeth away,”7316 as the apostle himself testifies; nor must it be predetermined
that the world will be restored, simply because it is the work of God. And surely if the universe,
after its ruin, is not to be formed again, why should a portion of it be? You are right,
if a portion is on an equality with the whole. But we maintain that there is a difference. In
the first place, because all things were made by the Word of God, and without Him was
nothing made.7317 Now the flesh, too, had its existence from the Word of God, because of
the principle,7318 that here should be nothing without that Word. “Let us make man,”7319
said He, before He created him, and added, “with our hand,” for the sake of his pre-eminence,
that so he might not be compared with the rest of creation.7320 And “God,” says (the

Scripture), “formed man.”7321 There is undoubtedly a great difference in the procedure,
springing of course from the nature of the case. For the creatures which were made were
inferior to him for whom they were made; and they were made for man, to whom they were
afterwards made subject by God. Rightly, therefore, had the creatures which were thus intended
for subjection, come forth into being at the bidding and command and sole power
of the divine voice; whilst man, on the contrary, destined to be their lord, was formed by
God Himself, to the intent that he might be able to exercise his mastery, being created by
the Master the Lord Himself. Remember, too, that man is properly called flesh, which had a
prior occupation in man’s designation: “And God formed man the clay of the ground.”7322
He now became man, who was hitherto clay. “And He breathed upon his face the breath of
life, and man (that is, the clay) became a living soul; and God placed the man whom He had
formed in the garden.”7323 So that man was clay at first, and only afterwards man entire. I
wish to impress this on your attention, with a view to your knowing, that whatever God has
at all purposed or promised to man, is due not to the soul simply, but to the flesh also; if
not arising out of any community in their origin, yet at all events by the privilege possessed
by the latter in its name.7324</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—Not the Lowliness of the Material, But the Dignity and Skill of the
Maker, Must Be Remembered, in Gauging the Excellence of the Flesh. Christ
Partook of Our Flesh.</head>
<p>Let me therefore pursue the subject before me—if I can but succeed in vindicating for
the flesh as much as was conferred on it by Him who made it, glorying as it even then was,
because that poor paltry material, clay, found its way into the hands of God, whatever these
were, happy enough at merely being touched by them. But why this glorying? Was it that,7325
without any further labour, the clay had instantly assumed its form at the touch of God?
The truth is,7326 a great matter was in progress, out of which the creature under consideration7327
was being fashioned. So often then does it receive honour, as often as it experiences
the hands of God, when it is touched by them, and pulled, and drawn out, and moulded
into shape. Imagine God wholly employed and absorbed in it—in His hand, His eye, His
labour, His purpose, His wisdom, His providence, and above all, in His love, which was
dictating the lineaments (of this creature). For, whatever was the form and expression which
was then given to the clay (by the Creator) Christ was in His thoughts as one day to become
man, because the Word, too, was to be both clay and flesh, even as the earth was then. For
so did the Father previously say to the Son: “Let us make man in our own image, after our
likeness.”7328 And God made man, that is to say, the creature which He moulded and fashioned;
after the image of God (in other words, of Christ) did He make him. And the Word
was God also, who being7329 in the image of God, “thought it not robbery to be equal to
God.”7330 Thus, that clay which was even then putting on the image of Christ, who was to
come in the flesh, was not only the work, but also the pledge and surety, of God. To what
purpose is it to bandy about the name earth, as that of a sordid and grovelling element, with
the view of tarnishing the origin of the flesh, when, even if any other material had been
available for forming man, it would be requisite that the dignity of the Maker should be
taken into consideration, who even by His selection of His material deemed it, and by His
management made it, worthy? The hand of Phidias forms the Olympian Jupiter of ivory;
worship is given to the statue, and it is no longer regarded as a god formed out of a most

silly animal, but as the world’s supreme Deity—not because of the bulk of the elephant, but
on account of the renown of Phidias. Could not therefore the living God, the true God,
purge away by His own operation whatever vileness might have accrued to His material,
and heal it of all infirmity? Or must this remain to show how much more nobly man could
fabricate a god, than God could form a man? Now, although the clay is offensive (for its
poorness), it is now something else. What I possess is flesh, not earth, even although of the
flesh it is said: “Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.”7331 In these words there is
the mention of the origin, not a recalling of the substance. The privilege has been granted
to the flesh to be nobler than its origin, and to have happiness aggrandized by the change
wrought in it. Now, even gold is earth, because of the earth; but it remains earth no longer
after it becomes gold, but is a far different substance, more splendid and more noble, though
coming from a source which is comparatively faded and obscure. In like manner, it was
quite allowable for God that He should clear the gold of our flesh from all the taints, as you
deem them, of its native clay, by purging the original substance of its dross.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—The Earthy Material of Which Flesh is Created Wonderfully Improved
by God’s Manipulation. By the Addition of the Soul in Man’s Constitution It
Became the Chief Work in the Creation.</head>
<p>But perhaps the dignity of the flesh may seem to be diminished, because it has not been
actually manipulated by the hand of God, as the clay was at first. Now, when God handled
the clay for the express purpose of the growth of flesh out of it afterwards, it was for the
flesh that He took all the trouble. But I want you, moreover, to know at what time and in
what manner the flesh flourished into beauty out of its clay. For it cannot be, as some will
have it, that those “coats of skins”7332 which Adam and Eve put on when they were stripped
of paradise, were really themselves the forming of the flesh out of clay,7333 because long
before that Adam had already recognised the flesh which was in the woman as the
propagation of his own substance (“This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh”7334),
and the very taking of the woman out of the man was supplemented with flesh; but it ought,
I should suppose, to have been made good with clay, if Adam was still clay. The clay,
therefore, was obliterated and absorbed into flesh. When did this happen? At the time that
man became a living soul by the inbreathing of God—by the breath indeed which was capable
of hardening clay into another substance, as into some earthenware, so now into flesh. In
the same way the potter, too, has it in his power, by tempering the blast of his fire, to
modify his clayey material into a stiffer one, and to mould one form after another more
beautiful than the original substance, and now possessing both a kind and name of its own.
For although the Scripture says, “Shall the clay say to the potter?”7335 that is, Shall man
contend with God? although the apostle speaks of “earthen vessels”7336 he refers to man,
who was originally clay. And the vessel is the flesh, because this was made of clay by the
breath of the divine afflatus; and it was afterwards clothed with “the coats of skins,” that is,
with the cutaneous covering which was placed over it. So truly is this the fact, that if you
withdraw the skin, you lay bare the flesh. Thus, that which becomes a spoil when stripped
off, was a vestment as long as it remained laid over. Hence the apostle, when he call circumcision
“a putting off (or spoliation) of the flesh,”7337 affirmed the skin to be a coat or tunic.
Now this being the case, you have both the clay made glorious by the hand of God, and the
flesh more glorious still by His breathing upon it, by virtue of which the flesh not only laid

aside its clayey rudiments, but also took on itself the ornaments of the soul. You surely are
not more careful than God, that you indeed should refuse to mount the gems of Scythia and
India and the pearls of the Red Sea in lead, or brass, or iron, or even in silver, but should
set them in the most precious and most highly-wrought gold; or, again, that you should
provide for your finest wines and most costly unguents the most fitting vessels; or, on the
same principle, should find for your swords of finished temper scabbards of equal worth;
whilst God must consign to some vilest sheath the shadow of His own soul, the breath of
His own Spirit, the operation of His own mouth, and by so ignominious a consignment secure,
of course, its condemnation. Well, then, has He placed, or rather inserted and commingled,
it with the flesh? Yes; and so intimate is the union, that it may be deemed to be
uncertain whether the flesh bears about the soul, or the soul the flesh; or whether the flesh
acts as apparitor to the soul, or the soul to the flesh. It is, however, more credible that the
soul has service rendered to it,7338 and has the mastery,7339 as being more proximate in
character to God.7340 This circumstance even redounds to the glory of the flesh, inasmuch
as it both contains an essence nearest to God’s, and renders itself a partaker of (the soul’s)
actual sovereignty. For what enjoyment of nature is there, what produce of the world, what
relish of the elements, which is not imparted to the soul by means of the body? How can it
be otherwise? Is it not by its means that the soul is supported by the entire apparatus of the
senses—the sight, the hearing, the taste, the smell, the touch? Is it not by its means that it
has a sprinkling of the divine power, there being nothing which it does not effect by its faculty
of speech, even when it is only tacitly indicated? And speech is the result of a fleshly organ.
The arts come through the flesh; through the flesh also effect is given to the mind’s pursuits
and powers; all work, too, and business and offices of life, are accomplished by the flesh;
and so utterly are the living acts of the soul the work of the flesh, that for the soul to cease
to do living acts, would be nothing else than sundering itself from the flesh. So also the very
act of dying is a function of the flesh, even as the process of life is. Now, if all things are
subject to the soul through the flesh, their subjection is equally due to the flesh. That which
is the means and agent of your enjoyment, must needs be also the partaker and sharer of
your enjoyment. So that the flesh, which is accounted the minister and servant of the soul,
turns out to be also its associate and co-heir. And if all this in temporal things, why not also
in things eternal?</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Christianity, by Its Provision for the Flesh, Has Put on It the Greatest
Honour. The Privileges of Our Religion in Closest Connection with Our Flesh.
Which Also Bears a Large Share in the Duties and Sacrifices of Religion.</head>
<p>Now such remarks have I wished to advance in defence of the flesh, from a general view
of the condition of our human nature. Let us now consider its special relation to Christianity,
and see how vast a privilege before God has been conferred on this poor and worthless
substance. It would suffice to say, indeed, that there is not a soul that can at all procure salvation,
except it believe whilst it is in the flesh, so true is it that the flesh is the very condition
on which salvation hinges. And since the soul is, in consequence of its salvation, chosen to
the service of God, it is the flesh which actually renders it capable of such service. The flesh,
indeed, is washed, in order that the soul may be cleansed; the flesh is anointed, that the soul
may be consecrated; the flesh is signed (with the cross), that the soul too may be fortified;
the flesh is shadowed with the imposition of hands, that the soul also maybe illuminated by
the Spirit; the flesh feeds on the body and blood of Christ, that the soul likewise may fatten
on its God. They cannot then be separated in their recompense, when they are united in
their service. Those sacrifices, moreover, which are acceptable to God—I mean conflicts of
the soul, fastings, and abstinences, and the humiliations which are annexed to such duty—it
is the flesh which performs again and again7341 to its own especial suffering. Virginity,
likewise, and widowhood, and the modest restraint in secret on the marriage-bed, and the
one only adoption7342 of it, are fragrant offerings to God paid out of the good services of
the flesh. Come, tell me what is your opinion of the flesh, when it has to contend for the
name of Christ, dragged out to public view, and exposed to the hatred of all men; when it
pines in prisons under the cruellest privation of light, in banishment from the world, amidst
squalor, filth, and noisome food, without freedom even in sleep, for it is bound on its very
pallet and mangled in its bed of straw; when at length before the public view it is racked by
every kind of torture that can be devised, and when finally it is spent beneath its agonies,
struggling to render its last turn for Christ by dying for Him—upon His own cross many
times, not to say by still more atrocious devices of torment. Most blessed, truly, and most
glorious, must be the flesh which can repay its Master Christ so vast a debt, and so completely,
that the only obligation remaining due to Him is, that it should cease by death to owe Him
more—all the more bound even then in gratitude, because (for ever) set free.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—God’s Love for the Flesh of Man, as Developed in the Grace of Christ
Towards It. The Flesh the Best Means of Displaying the Bounty and Power of
God.</head>
<p>To recapitulate, then: Shall that very flesh, which the Divine Creator formed with His
own hands in the image of God; which He animated with His own afflatus, after the likeness
of His own vital vigour; which He set over all the works of His hand, to dwell amongst, to
enjoy, and to rule them; which He clothed with His sacraments and His instructions; whose
purity He loves, whose mortifications He approves; whose sufferings for Himself He deems
precious;—(shall that flesh, I say), so often brought near to God, not rise again? God forbid,
God forbid, (I repeat), that He should abandon to everlasting destruction the labour of His
own hands, the care of His own thoughts, the receptacle of His own Spirit,7343 the queen
of His creation, the inheritor of His own liberality, the priestess of His religion, the champion
of His testimony, the sister of His Christ! We know by experience the goodness of God;
from His Christ we learn that He is the only God, and the very good. Now, as He requires
from us love to our neighbour after love to Himself,7344 so He will Himself do that which
He has commanded. He will love the flesh which is, so very closely and in so many ways,
His neighbour—(He will love it), although infirm, since His strength is made perfect in
weakness;7345 although disordered, since “they that are whole need not the physician, but
they that are sick;”7346 although not honourable, since “we bestow more abundant honour
upon the less honourable members;”7347 although ruined, since He says, “I am come to save
that which was lost;”7348 although sinful, since He says, “I desire rather the salvation of the
sinner than his death;”7349 although condemned, for says He, “I shall wound, and also
heal.”7350 Why reproach the flesh with those conditions which wait for God, which hope
in God, which receive honour from God, which He succours? I venture to declare, that if
such casualties as these had never befallen the flesh, the bounty, the grace, the mercy, (and
indeed) all the beneficent power of God, would have had no opportunity to work.7351</p>

<head>Chapter X.—Holy Scripture Magnifies the Flesh, as to Its Nature and Its Prospects.</head>
<p>You hold to the scriptures in which the flesh is disparaged; receive also those in which
it is ennobled. You read whatever passage abases it; direct your eyes also to that which elevates
it. “All flesh is grass.”7352 Well, but Isaiah was not content to say only this; but he also declared,
“All flesh shall see the salvation of God.”7353 They notice God when He says in
Genesis, “My Spirit shall not remain among these men, because they are flesh;”7354 but then
He is also heard saying by Joel, “I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh.”7355 Even the
apostle ought not to be known for any one statement in which he is wont to reproach the
flesh. For although he says that “in his flesh dwelleth no good thing;”7356 although he affirms
that “they who are in the flesh cannot please God,”7357 because “the flesh lusteth against
the Spirit;”7358 yet in these and similar assertions which he makes, it is not the substance of
the flesh, but its actions, which are censured. Moreover, we shall elsewhere7359 take occasion
to remark, that no reproaches can fairly be cast upon the flesh, without tending also to the
castigation of the soul, which compels the flesh to do its bidding. However, let me meanwhile
add that in the same passage Paul “carries about in his body the marks of the Lord Jesus;”7360
he also forbids our body to be profaned, as being “the temple of God;”7361 he makes our
bodies “the members of Christ;”7362 and he exhorts us to exalt and “glorify God in our
body.”7363 If, therefore, the humiliations of the flesh thrust off its resurrection, why shall
not its high prerogatives rather avail to bring it about?—since it better suits the character
of God to restore to salvation what for a while He rejected, than to surrender to perdition
what He once approved.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—The Power of God Fully Competent to Effect the Resurrection of the
Flesh.</head>
<p>Thus far touching my eulogy of the flesh, in opposition to its enemies, who are, notwithstanding,
its greatest friends also; for there is nobody who lives so much in accordance with
the flesh as they who deny the resurrection of the flesh, inasmuch as they despise all its discipline,
while they disbelieve its punishment. It is a shrewd saying which the Paraclete utters
concerning these persons by the mouth of the prophetess Prisca: “They are carnal,7364 and
yet they hate the flesh.” Since, then, the flesh has the best guarantee that could possibly accrue
for securing to it the recompense of salvation, ought we not also to consider well the power,
and might, and competency7365 of God Himself, whether He be so great as to be able to
rebuild and restore the edifice of the flesh, which had become dilapidated and blocked
up,7366 and in every possible way dislocated?—whether He has promulgated in the public
domains of nature any analogies to convince us of His power in this respect, lest any should
happen to be still thirsting for the knowledge of God, when faith in Him must rest on no
other basis than the belief that He is able to do all things? You have, no doubt amongst your
philosophers men who maintain that this world is without a beginning or a maker. It is,
however, much more true, that nearly all the heresies allow it an origin and a maker, and
ascribe its creation to our God. Firmly believe, therefore, that He produced it wholly out of
nothing, and then you have found the knowledge of God, by believing that He possesses
such mighty power. But some persons are too weak to believe all this at first, owing to their
views about Matter. They will rather have it, after the philosophers, that the universe was
in the beginning made by God out of underlying matter. Now, even if this opinion could
be held in truth, since He must be acknowledged to have produced in His reformation of
matter far different substances and far different forms from those which Matter itself possessed,
I should maintain, with no less persistence, that He produced these things out of
nothing, since they absolutely had no existence at all previous to His production of them.
Now, where is the difference between a thing’s being produced out of nothing or out of
something, if so be that what existed not comes into being, when even to have had no existence
is tantamount to having been nothing? The contrary is likewise true; for having once
existed amounts to having been something. If, however, there is a difference, both alternatives
support my position. For if God produced all things whatever out of nothing, He will be
able to draw forth from nothing even the flesh which had fallen into nothing; or if He
moulded other things out of matter, He will be able to call forth the flesh too from somewhere

else, into whatever abyss it may have been engulphed. And surely He is most competent to
re-create who created, inasmuch as it is a far greater work to have produced than to have
reproduced, to have imparted a beginning, than to have maintained a continuance. On this
principle, you may be quite sure that the restoration of the flesh is easier than its first
formation.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Some Analogies in Nature Which Corroborate the Resurrection of
the Flesh.</head>
<p>Consider now those very analogies of the divine power (to which we have just alluded).
Day dies into night, and is buried everywhere in darkness. The glory of the world is obscured
in the shadow of death; its entire substance is tarnished with blackness; all things become
sordid, silent, stupid; everywhere business ceases, and occupations rest. And so over the
loss of the light there is mourning. But yet it again revives, with its own beauty, its own
dowry, is own sun, the same as ever, whole and entire, over all the world, slaying its own
death, night—opening its own sepulchre, the darkness—coming forth the heir to itself, until
the night also revives—it, too, accompanied with a retinue of its own. For the stellar rays
are rekindled, which had been quenched in the morning glow; the distant groups of the
constellations are again brought back to view, which the day’s temporary interval had removed
out of sight. Readorned also are the mirrors of the moon, which her monthly course
had worn away. Winters and summers return, as do the spring-tide and autumn, with their
resources, their routines, their fruits. Forasmuch as earth receives its instruction from
heaven to clothe the trees which had been stripped, to colour the flowers afresh, to spread
the grass again, to reproduce the seed which had been consumed, and not to reproduce
them until consumed. Wondrous method! from a defrauder to be a preserver, in order to
restore, it takes away; in order to guard, it destroys; that it may make whole, it injures; and
that it may enlarge, it first lessens. (This process) indeed, renders back to us richer and fuller
blessings than it deprived us of—by a destruction which is profit, by an injury which is advantage,
and by a loss which is gain. In a word, I would say, all creation is instinct with renewal.
Whatever you may chance upon, has already existed; whatever you have lost, returns
again without fail. All things return to their former state, after having gone out of sight; all
things begin after they have ended; they come to an end for the very purpose of coming into
existence again. Nothing perishes but with a view to salvation. The whole, therefore, of this
revolving order of things bears witness to the resurrection of the dead. In His works did
God write it, before He wrote it in the Scriptures; He proclaimed it in His mighty deeds
earlier than in His inspired words. He first sent Nature to you as a teacher, meaning to send
Prophecy also as a supplemental instructor, that, being Nature’s disciple, you may more
easily believe Prophecy, and without hesitation accept (its testimony) when you come to
hear what you have seen already on every side; nor doubt that God, whom you have discovered
to be the restorer of all things, is likewise the reviver of the flesh. And surely, as all
things rise again for man, for whose use they have been provided—but not for man except
for his flesh also—how happens it that (the flesh) itself can perish utterly, because of which
and for the service of which nothing comes to nought?</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—From Our Author’s View of a Verse in the Ninety-Second Psalm,
the Phoenix is Made a Symbol of the Resurrection of Our Bodies.</head>
<p>If, however, all nature but faintly figures our resurrection; if creation affords no sign
precisely like it, inasmuch as its several phenomena can hardly be said to die so much as to
come to an end, nor again be deemed to be reanimated, but only re-formed; then take a
most complete and unassailable symbol of our hope, for it shall be an animated being, and
subject alike to life and death. I refer to the bird which is peculiar to the East, famous for its
singularity, marvelous from its posthumous life, which renews its life in a voluntary death;
its dying day is its birthday, for on it it departs and returns; once more a phoenix where just
now there was none; once more himself, but just now out of existence; another, yet the same.
What can be more express and more significant for our subject; or to what other thing can
such a phenomenon bear witness? God even in His own Scripture says: “The righteous shall
flourish like the phoenix;”7367 that is, shall flourish or revive, from death, from the grave—to
teach you to believe that a bodily substance may be recovered even from the fire. Our Lord
has declared that we are “better than many sparrows:”7368 well, if not better than many a
phoenix too, it were no great thing. But must men die once for all, while birds in Arabia are
sure of a resurrection?</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—A Sufficient Cause for the Resurrection of the Flesh Occurs in the
Future Judgment of Man. It Will Take Cognisance of the Works of the Body No
Less Than of the Soul.</head>
<p>Such, then, being the outlines of the divine energies which God has displayed as much
in the parables of nature as in His spoken word, let us now approach His very edicts and
decrees, since this is the division which we mainly adopt in our subject-matter. We began
with the dignity of the flesh, whether it were of such a nature that when once destroyed it
was capable of being restored. Then we pursued an inquiry touching the power of God,
whether it was sufficiently great to be habitually able to confer this restoration on a thing
which had been destroyed. Now, if we have proved these two points, I should like you to
inquire into the (question of) cause, whether it be one of sufficient weight to claim the resurrection
of the flesh as necessary and as conformable in every way to reason; because there
underlies this demurrer: the flesh may be quite capable of being restored, and the Deity be
perfectly able to effect the restoration, but a cause for such recovery must needs pre-exist.
Admit then a sufficient one, you who learn of a God who is both supremely good as well as
just7369—supremely good from His own (character), just in consequence of ours. For if
man had never sinned, he would simply and solely have known God in His superlative
goodness, from the attribute of His nature. But now he experiences Him to be a just God
also, from the necessity of a cause; still, however, retaining under this very circumstance
His excellent goodness, at the same time that He is also just. For, by both succouring the
good and punishing the evil, He displays His justice, and at the same time makes both processes
contribute proofs of His goodness, whilst on the one hand He deals vengeance, and
on the other dispenses reward. But with Marcion7370 you will have the opportunity of more
fully learning whether this be the whole character of God. Meanwhile, so perfect is our
(God), that He is rightly Judge, because He is the Lord; rightly the Lord, because the Creator;
rightly the Creator, because He is God. Whence it happens that that heretic, whose name I
know not, holds that He properly is not a Judge, since He is not Lord; properly not Lord,
since He is not the Creator. And so I am at a loss to know how He is God, who is neither
the Creator, which God is; nor the Lord, which the Creator is. Inasmuch, then, as it is most
suitable for the great Being who is God, and Lord, and Creator to summon man to a judgment
on this very question, whether he has taken care or not to acknowledge and honour his Lord
and Creator, this is just such a judgment as the resurrection shall achieve. The entire cause,
then, or rather necessity of the resurrection, will be this, namely, that arrangement of the
final judgment which shall be most suitable to God. Now, in effecting this arrangement,

you must consider whether the divine censure superintends a judicial examination of the
two natures of man—both his soul and his flesh. For that which is a suitable object to be
judged, is also a competent one to be raised. Our position is, that the judgment of God must
be believed first of all to be plenary, and then absolute, so as to be final, and therefore irrevocable;
to be also righteous, not bearing less heavily on any particular part; to be moreover
worthy of God, being complete and definite, in keeping with His great patience. Thus it
follows that the fulness and perfection of the judgment consists simply in representing the
interests of the entire human being. Now, since the entire man consists of the union of the
two natures, he must therefore appear in both, as it is right that he should be judged in his
entirety; nor, of course, did he pass through life except in his entire state. As therefore he
lived, so also must he be judged, because he has to be judged concerning the way in which
he lived. For life is the cause of judgment, and it must undergo investigation in as many
natures as it possessed when it discharged its vital functions.</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—As the Flesh is a Partaker with the Soul in All Human Conduct, So
Will It Be in the Recompense of Eternity.</head>
<p>Come now, let our opponents sever the connection of the flesh with the soul in the affairs
of life, that they may be emboldened to sunder it also in the recompense of life. Let them
deny their association in acts, that they may be fairly able to deny also their participation
in rewards. The flesh ought not to have any share in the sentence, if it had none in the cause
of it. Let the soul alone be called back, if it alone went away. But (nothing of the kind ever
happened); for the soul alone no more departed from life, than it ran through alone the
course from which it departed—I mean this present life. Indeed, the soul alone is so far from
conducting (the affairs of) life, that we do not withdraw from community with the flesh
even our thoughts, however isolated they be, however unprecipitated into act by means of
the flesh; since whatever is done in man’s heart is done by the soul in the flesh, and with the
flesh, and through the flesh. The Lord Himself, in short, when rebuking our thoughts, includes
in His censures this aspect of the flesh, (man’s heart), the citadel of the soul: “Why
think ye evil in your hearts?”7371 and again: “Whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after
her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.”7372 So that even the thought,
without operation and without effect, is an act of the flesh. But if you allow that the faculty
which rules the senses, and which they call Hegemonikon,7373 has its sanctuary in the brain,
or in the interval between the eyebrows, or wheresoever the philosophers are pleased to
locate it, the flesh will still be the thinking place of the soul. The soul is never without the
flesh, as long as it is in the flesh. There is nothing which the flesh does not transact in company
with the soul, when without it it does not exist. Consider carefully, too, whether the
thoughts are not administered by the flesh, since it is through the flesh that they are distinguished
and known externally. Let the soul only meditate some design, the face gives the
indication—the face being the mirror of all our intentions. They may deny all combination
in acts, but they cannot gainsay their co-operation in thoughts. Still they enumerate the sins
of the flesh; surely, then, for its sinful conduct it must be consigned to punishment. But we,
moreover, allege against them the virtues of the flesh; surely also for its virtuous conduct it
deserves a future reward. Again, as it is the soul which acts and impels us in all we do, so it
is the function of the flesh to render obedience. Now we are not permitted to suppose that
God is either unjust or idle. Unjust, (however He would be,) were He to exclude from reward
the flesh which is associated in good works; and idle, were He to exempt it from punishment,
when it has been an accomplice in evil deeds: whereas human judgment is deemed to be
the more perfect, when it discovers the agents in every deed, and neither spares the guilty

<head>Chapter XVI.—The Heretics Called the Flesh “The Vessel of the Soul,” In Order to
Destroy the Responsibility of the Body. Their Cavil Turns Upon Themselves
and Shows the Flesh to Be a Sharer in Human Actions.</head>
<p>When, however, we attribute to the soul authority, and to the flesh submission, we must
see to it that (our opponents) do not turn our position by another argument, by insisting
on so placing the flesh in the service of the soul, that it be not (considered as) its servant,
lest they should be compelled, if it were so regarded, to admit its companionship (to the
soul). For they would argue that servants and companions possess a discretion in discharging
the functions of their respective office, and a power over their will in both relations: in short,
(they would claim to be) men themselves, and therefore (would expect) to share the credit
with their principals, to whom they voluntarily yielded their assistance; whereas the flesh
had no discretion, no sentiment in itself, but possessing no power of its own of willing or
refusing, it, in fact, appears to stand to the soul in the stead of a vessel as an instrument
rather than a servant. The soul alone, therefore, will have to be judged (at the last day) preeminently
as to how it has employed the vessel of the flesh; the vessel itself, of course, not
being amenable to a judicial award: for who condemns the cup if any man has mixed poison
in it? or who sentences the sword to the beasts, if a man has perpetrated with it the atrocities
of a brigand? Well, now, we will grant that the flesh is innocent, in so far as bad actions will
not be charged upon it: what, then, is there to hinder its being saved on the score of its innocence?
For although it is free from all imputation of good works, as it is of evil ones, yet
it is more consistent with the divine goodness to deliver the innocent. A beneficent man,
indeed, is bound to do so: it suits then the character of the Most Bountiful to bestow even
gratuitously such a favour. And yet, as to the cup, I will not take the poisoned one, into
which some certain death is injected, but one which has been infected with the breath of a
lascivious woman,7374 or of Cybele’s priest, or of a gladiator, or of a hangman: then I want
to know whether you would pass a milder condemnation on it than on the kisses of such
persons? One indeed which is soiled with our own filth, or one which is not mingled to our
own mind we are apt to dash to pieces, and then to increase our anger with our servant. As
for the sword, which is drunk with the blood of the brigand’s victims, who would not banish
it entirely from his house, much more from his bed-room, or from his pillow, from the
presumption that he would be sure to dream of nothing but the apparitions of the souls
which were pursuing and disquieting him for lying down with the blade which shed their
own blood? Take, however, the cup which has no reproach on it, and which deserves the
credit of a faithful ministration, it will be adorned by its drinking-master with chaplets, or
be honoured with a handful of flowers. The sword also which has received honourable stains
in war, and has been thus engaged in a better manslaughter, will secure its own praise by

<pb n="1242"/>
consecration. It is quite possible, then, to pass decisive sentences even on vessels and on
instruments, that so they too may participate in the merits of their proprietors and employers.
Thus much do I say from a desire to meet even this argument, although there is a failure in
the example, owing to the diversity in the nature of the objects. For every vessel or every
instrument becomes useful from without, consisting as it does of material perfectly extraneous
to the substance of the human owner or employer; whereas the flesh, being conceived, formed,
and generated along with the soul from its earliest existence in the womb, is mixed up with
it likewise in all its operations. For although it is called “a vessel” by the apostle, such as he
enjoins to be treated “with honour,”7375 it is yet designated by the same apostle as “the
outward man,”7376—that clay, of course, which at the first was inscribed with the title of a
man, not of a cup or a sword, or any paltry vessel. Now it is called a “vessel” in consideration
of its capacity, whereby it receives and contains the soul; but “man,” from its community
of nature, which renders it in all operations a servant and not an instrument. Accordingly,
in the judgment it will be held to be a servant (even though it may have no independent
discretion of its own), on the ground of its being an integral portion of that which possesses
such discretion, and is not a mere chattel. And although the apostle is well aware that the
flesh does nothing of itself which is not also imputed to the soul, he yet deems the flesh to
be “sinful;”7377 lest it should be supposed to be free from all responsibility by the mere fact
of its seeming to be impelled by the soul. So, again, when he is ascribing certain praiseworthy
actions to the flesh, he says, “Therefore glorify and exalt God in your body,”7378—being
certain that such efforts are actuated by the soul; but still he ascribes them to the flesh, because
it is to it that he also promises the recompense. Besides, neither rebuke, (on the one hand),
would have been suitable to it, if free from blame; nor, (on the other hand), would exhortation,
if it were incapable of glory. Indeed, both rebuke and exhortation would be alike idle
towards the flesh, if it were an improper object for that recompence which is certainly received
in the resurrection.</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.—The Flesh Will Be Associated with the Soul in Enduring the Penal
Sentences of the Final Judgment.</head>
<p>“Every uneducated7379 person who agrees with our opinion will be apt to suppose that
the flesh will have to be present at the final judgment even on this account, because otherwise
the soul would be incapable of suffering pain or pleasure, as being incorporeal; for this is
the common opinion. We on our part, however, do here maintain, and in a special treatise
on the subject prove, that the soul is corporeal, possessing a peculiar kind of solidity in its
nature, such as enables it both to perceive and suffer. That souls are even now susceptible
of torment and of blessing in Hades, though they are disembodied, and notwithstanding
their banishment from the flesh, is proved by the case of Lazarus. I have no doubt given to
my opponent room to say: Since, then, the soul has a bodily substance of its own, it will be
sufficiently endowed with the faculty of suffering and sense, so as not to require the presence
of the flesh. No, no, (is my reply): it will still need the flesh; not as being unable to feel anything
without the help of the flesh, but because it is necessary that it should possess such a
faculty along with the flesh. For in as far as it has a sufficiency of its own for action, in so
far has it likewise a capacity for suffering. But the truth is, in respect of action, it labours
under some amount of incapacity; for in its own nature it has simply the ability to think, to
will, to desire, to dispose: for fully carrying out the purpose, it looks for the assistance of the
flesh. In like manner, it also requires the conjunction of the flesh to endure suffering, in
order that by its aid it may be as fully able to suffer, as without its assistance it was not fully
able to act. In respect, indeed, of those sins, such as concupiscence, and thought, and wish,
which it has a competency of its own to commit, it at once7380 pays the penalty of them.
Now, no doubt, if these were alone sufficient to constitute absolute desert without requiring
the addition of acts, the soul would suffice in itself to encounter the full responsibility of the
judgment, being to be judged for those things in the doing of which it alone had possessed
a sufficiency. Since, however, acts too are indissolubly attached to deserts; since also acts
are ministerially effected by the flesh, it is no longer enough that the soul apart from the
flesh be requited with pleasure or pain for what are actually works of the flesh, although it
has a body (of its own), although it has members (of its own), which in like manner are insufficient
for its full perception, just as they are also for its perfect action. Therefore as it
has acted in each several instance, so proportionably does it suffer in Hades, being the first
to taste of judgment as it was the first to induce to the commission of sin; but still it is
waiting for the flesh in order that it may through the flesh also compensate for its deeds,
inasmuch as it laid upon the flesh the execution of its own thoughts. This, in short, will be
the process of that judgment which is postponed to the last great day, in order that by the
<note type="footnote">7379 Simplicior.</note>

<pb n="1244"/>
exhibition of the flesh the entire course of the divine vengeance may be accomplished. Besides,
(it is obvious to remark) there would be no delaying to the end of that doom which souls
are already tasting in Hades, if it was destined for souls alone.</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Scripture Phrases and Passages Clearly Assert “The Resurrection
of the Dead.” The Force of This Very Phrase Explained as Indicating the
Prominent Place of the Flesh in the General Resurrection.</head>
<p>Thus far it has been my object by prefatory remarks to lay a foundation for the defence
of all the Scriptures which promise a resurrection of the flesh. Now, inasmuch as this verity
is supported by so many just and reasonable considerations—I mean the dignity of the flesh
itself,7381 the power and might of God,7382 the analogous cases in which these are displayed,
7383 as well as the good reasons for the judgment, and the need thereof7384—it will
of course be only right and proper that the Scriptures should be understood in the sense
suggested by such authoritative considerations, and not after the conceits of the heretics,
which arise from infidelity solely, because it is deemed incredible that the flesh should be
recovered from death and restored to life; not because (such a restoration) is either unattainable
by the flesh itself, or impossible for God to effect, or unsuitable to the final judgment.
Incredible, no doubt, it might be, if it had not been revealed in the word of God;7385 except
that, even if it had not been thus first announced by God, it might have been fairly enough
assumed, that the revelation of it had been withheld, simply because so many strong presumptions
in its favour had been already furnished. Since, however, (the great fact) is proclaimed
in so many inspired passages, that is so far a dissuasive against understanding it in
a sense different from that which is attested by such arguments as persuade us to its reception,
even irrespective of the testimonies of revelation. Let us see, then, first of all in what title
this hope of ours is held out to our view.7386 There is, I imagine, one divine edict which is
exposed to the gaze of all men: it is “The Resurrection of the Dead.”7387 These words are
prompt, decisive, clear. I mean to take these very terms, discuss them, and discover to what
substance they apply. As to the word resurrectio, whenever I hear of its impending over a
human being, I am forced to inquire what part of him has been destined to fall, since nothing
can be expected to rise again, unless it has first been prostrated. It is only the man who is
ignorant of the fact that the flesh falls by death, that can fail to discover that it stands erect
by means of life. Nature pronounces God’s sentence: “Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt
thou return.”7388 Even the man who has not heard the sentence, sees the fact. No death but

<pb n="1246"/>
is the ruin of our limbs. This destiny of the body the Lord also described, when, clothed as
He was in its very substance, He said, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it
up again.”7389 For He showed to what belongs (the incidents of) being destroyed, thrown
down, and kept down—even to that to which it also appertains to be lifted and raised up
again; although He was at the same time bearing about with Him “a soul that was trembling
even unto death,”7390 but which did not fall through death, because even the Scripture informs
us that “He spoke of His body.”7391 So that it is the flesh which falls by death; and
accordingly it derives its name, cadaver, from cadendo.7392 The soul, however, has no trace
of a fall in its designation, as indeed there is no mortality in its condition. Nay it is the soul
which communicates its ruin to the body when it is breathed out of it, just as it is also destined
to raise it up again from the earth when it shall re-enter it. That cannot fall which by its entrance
raises; nor can that droop which by its departure causes ruin. I will go further, and
say that the soul does not even fall into sleep along with the body, nor does it with its companion
even lie down in repose. For it is agitated in dreams, and disturbed: it might, however,
rest, if it lay down; and lie down it certainly would, if it fell. Thus that which does not fall
even into the likeness of death, does not succumb to the reality thereof. Passing now to the
other word mortuorum, I wish you to look carefully, and see to what substance it is applicable.
Were we to allow, under this head, as is sometimes held by the heretics, that the soul is
mortal, so that being mortal it shall attain to a resurrection; this would afford a presumption
that the flesh also, being no less mortal, would share in the same resurrection. But our present
point is to derive from the proper signification of this word an idea of the destiny which it
indicates. Now, just as the term resurrection is predicated of that which falls—that is, the
flesh—so will there be the same application of the word dead, because what is called “the
resurrection of the dead” indicates the rising up again of that which is fallen down. We learn
this from the case of Abraham, the father of the faithful, a man who enjoyed close intercourse
with God. For when he requested of the sons of Heth a spot to bury Sarah in, he said to
them, “Give me the possession of a burying place with you, that I may bury my
dead,”7393—meaning, of course, her flesh; for he could not have desired a place to bury her
soul in, even if the soul is to be deemed mortal, and even if it could bear to be described by
the word “dead.” Since, then, this word indicates the body, it follows that when “the resurrection
of the dead” is spoken of, it is the rising again of men’s bodies that is meant.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—The Sophistical Sense Put by Heretics on the Phrase “Resurrection
of the Dead,” As If It Meant the Moral Change of a New Life.</head>
<p>Now this consideration of the phrase in question, and its signification—besides maintaining,
of course, the true meaning of the important words—must needs contribute to this
further result, that whatever obscurity our adversaries throw over the subject under the
pretence of figurative and allegorical language, the truth will stand out in clearer light, and
out of uncertainties certain and definite rules will be prescribed. For some, when they have
alighted on a very usual form of prophetic statement, generally expressed in figure and allegory,
though not always, distort into some imaginary sense even the most clearly described
doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, alleging that even death itself must be understood
in a spiritual sense. They say that which is commonly supposed to be death is not really
so,—namely, the separation of body and soul: it is rather the ignorance of God, by reason
of which man is dead to God, and is not less buried in error than he would be in the grave.
Wherefore that also must be held to be the resurrection, when a man is reanimated by access
to the truth, and having dispersed the death of ignorance, and being endowed with new life
by God, has burst forth from the sepulchre of the old man, even as the Lord likened the
scribes and Pharisees to “whited sepulchres.”7394 Whence it follows that they who have by
faith attained to the resurrection, are with the Lord after they have once put Him on in their
baptism. By such subtlety, then, even in conversation have they often been in the habit of
misleading our brethren, as if they held a resurrection of the dead as well as we. Woe, say
they, to him who has not risen in the present body; for they fear that they might alarm their
hearers if they at once denied the resurrection. Secretly, however, in their minds they think
this: Woe betide the simpleton who during his present life fails to discover the mysteries of
heresy; since this, in their view, is the resurrection. There are however, a great many also,
who, claiming to hold a resurrection after the soul’s departure, maintain that going out of
the sepulchre means escaping out of the world, since in their view the world is the habitation
of the dead—that is, of those who know not God; or they will go so far as to say that it actually
means escaping out of the body itself, since they imagine that the body detains the soul,
when it is shut up in the death of a worldly life, as in a grave.</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—Figurative Senses Have Their Foundation in Literal Fact. Besides, the
Allegorical Style is by No Means the Only One Found in the Prophetic Scriptures,
as Alleged by the Heretics.</head>
<p>Now, to upset all conceits of this sort, let me dispel at once the preliminary idea on
which they rest—their assertion that the prophets make all their announcements in figures
of speech. Now, if this were the case, the figures themselves could not possibly have been
distinguished, inasmuch as the verities would not have been declared, out of which the figurative
language is stretched. And, indeed, if all are figures, where will be that of which they
are the figures? How can you hold up a mirror for your face, if the face nowhere exists? But,
in truth, all are not figures, but there are also literal statements; nor are all shadows, but
there are bodies too: so that we have prophecies about the Lord Himself even, which are
clearer than the day. For it was not figuratively that the Virgin conceived in her womb; nor
in a trope did she bear Emmanuel, that is, Jesus, God with us.7395 Even granting that He
was figuratively to take the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria,7396 still it was
literally that He was to “enter into judgment with the elders and princes of the people.”7397
For in the person of Pilate “the heathen raged,” and in the person of Israel “the people
imagined vain things;” “the kings of the earth” in Herod, and the rulers in Annas and Caiaphas,
were gathered together “against the Lord, and against His anointed.”7398 He, again,
was “led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a sheep before the shearer,” that is, Herod, “is
dumb, so He opened not His mouth.”7399 “He gave His back to scourges, and His cheeks
to blows, not turning His face even from the shame of spitting.”7400 “He was numbered
with the transgressors;”7401 “He was pierced in His hands and His feet;”7402 “they cast lots
for his raiment;”7403 “they gave Him gall, and made Him drink vinegar;”7404 “they shook
their heads, and mocked Him;”7405 “He was appraised by the traitor in thirty pieces of silver.”

statements of prophecy, according to the analogy of the physical diseases which were healed
by the Lord; but still they were all fulfilled literally: thus showing that the prophets foretold
both senses, except that very many of their words can only be taken in a pure and simple
signification, and free from all allegorical obscurity; as when we hear of the downfall of nations
and cities, of Tyre and Egypt, and Babylon and Edom, and the navy of Carthage; also
when they foretell Israel’s own chastisements and pardons, its captivities, restorations, and
at last its final dispersion. Who would prefer affixing a metaphorical interpretation to all
these events, instead of accepting their literal truth? The realities are involved in the words,
just as the words are read in the realities. Thus, then, (we find that) the allegorical style is
not used in all parts of the prophetic record, although it occasionally occurs in certain portions

<head>Chapter XXI.—No Mere Metaphor in the Phrase Resurrection of the Dead. In Proportion
to the Importance of Eternal Truths, is the Clearness of Their Scriptural
Enunciation.</head>
<p>Well, if it occurs occasionally in certain portions of it, you will say, then why not in that
phrase,7410 where the resurrection might be spiritually understood? There are several reasons
why not. First, what must be the meaning of so many important passages of Holy Scripture,
which so obviously attest the resurrection of the body, as to admit not even the appearance
of a figurative signification? And, indeed, (since some passages are more obscure than others),
it cannot but be right—as we have shown above7411—that uncertain statements should be
determined by certain ones, and obscure ones by such as are clear and plain; else there is
fear that, in the conflict of certainties and uncertainties, of explicitness and obscurity, faith
may be shattered, truth endangered, and the Divine Being Himself be branded as inconstant.
Then arises the improbability that the very mystery on which our trust wholly rests, on
which also our instruction entirely depends, should have the appearance of being ambiguously
announced and obscurely propounded, inasmuch as the hope of the resurrection, unless it
be clearly set forth on the sides both of punishment and reward, would fail to persuade any
to embrace a religion like ours, exposed as it is to public detestation and the imputation of
hostility to others. There is no certain work where the remuneration is uncertain. There is
no real apprehension when the peril is only doubtful. But both the recompense of reward,
and the danger of losing it, depend on the issues of the resurrection. Now, if even those
purposes of God against cities, and nations, and kings, which are merely temporal, local,
and personal in their character, have been proclaimed so clearly in prophecy, how is it to
be supposed that those dispensations of His which are eternal, and of universal concern to
the human race, should be void of all real light in themselves? The grander they are, the
clearer should be their announcement, in order that their superior greatness might be believed.
And I apprehend that God cannot possibly have ascribed to Him either envy, or
guile, or inconsistency, or artifice, by help of which evil qualities it is that all schemes of
unusual grandeur are litigiously promulgated.</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—The Scriptures Forbid Our Supposing Either that the Resurrection
is Already Past, or that It Takes Place Immediately at Death. Our Hopes and
Prayers Point to the Last Great Day as the Period of Its Accomplishment.</head>
<p>We must after all this turn our attention to those scriptures also which forbid our belief
in such a resurrection as is held by your Animalists (for I will not call them Spiritualists),7412
that it is either to be assumed as taking place now, as soon as men come to the knowledge
of the truth, or else that it is accomplished immediately after their departure from this life.
Now, forasmuch as the seasons of our entire hope have been fixed in the Holy Scripture,
and since we are not permitted to place the accomplishment thereof, as I apprehend, previous
to Christ’s coming, our prayers are directed towards7413 the end of this world, to the passing
away thereof at the great day of the Lord—of His wrath and vengeance—the last day, which
is hidden (from all), and known to none but the Father, although announced beforehand
by signs and wonders, and the dissolution of the elements, and the conflicts of nations. I
would turn out the words of the prophets, if the Lord Himself had said nothing (except that
prophecies were the Lord’s own word); but it is more to my purpose that He by His own
mouth confirms their statement. Being questioned by His disciples when those things were
to come to pass which He had just been uttering about the destruction of the temple, He
discourses to them first of the order of Jewish events until the overthrow of Jerusalem, and
then of such as concerned all nations up to the very end of the world. For after He had declared
that “Jerusalem was to be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles
should be fulfilled,”7414—meaning, of course, those which were to be chosen of God, and
gathered in with the remnant of Israel—He then goes on to proclaim, against this world
and dispensation (even as Joel had done, and Daniel, and all the prophets with one consent7415),
that “there should be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars, distress
of nations with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring, men’s hearts failing them for fear,
and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth.”7416 “For,” says He, “the
powers of heaven shall be shaken; and then shall they see the Son of man coming in the
clouds, with power and great glory. And when these things begin to come to pass, then look
up, and lift up your heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.”7417 He spake of its “drawing

nigh,” not of its being present already; and of “those things beginning to come to pass,” not
of their having happened: because when they have come to pass, then our redemption shall
be at hand, which is said to be approaching up to that time, raising and exciting our minds
to what is then the proximate harvest of our hope. He immediately annexes a parable of this
in “the trees which are tenderly sprouting into a flower-stalk, and then developing the flower,
which is the precursor of the fruit.”7418 “So likewise ye,” (He adds), “when ye shall see all
these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of heaven is nigh at hand.”7419 “Watch
ye, therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all those things,
and to stand before the Son of man;”7420 that is, no doubt, at the resurrection, after all these
things have been previously transacted. Therefore, although there is a sprouting in the acknowledgment
of all this mystery, yet it is only in the actual presence of the Lord that the
flower is developed and the fruit borne. Who is it then, that has aroused the Lord, now at
God’s right hand, so unseasonably and with such severity “shake terribly” (as Isaiah7421
expresses it) “that earth,” which, I suppose, is as yet unshattered? Who has thus early put
“Christ’s enemies beneath His feet” (to use the language of David7422), making Him more
hurried than the Father, whilst every crowd in our popular assemblies is still with shouts
consigning “the Christians to the lions?”7423 Who has yet beheld Jesus descending from
heaven in like manner as the apostles saw Him ascend, according to the appointment of the
two angels?7424 Up to the present moment they have not, tribe by tribe, smitten their breasts,
looking on Him whom they pierced.7425 No one has as yet fallen in with Elias;7426 no one
has as yet escaped from Antichrist;7427 no one has as yet had to bewail the downfall of
Babylon.7428 And is there now anybody who has risen again, except the heretic? He, of
course, has already quitted the grave of his own corpse—although he is even now liable to
fevers and ulcers; he, too, has already trodden down his enemies—although he has even
now to struggle with the powers of the world. And as a matter of course, he is already a
king—although he even now owes to Cæsar the things which are Cæsar’s.7429</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Sundry Passages of St. Paul, Which Speak of a Spiritual Resurrection,
Compatible with the Future Resurrection of the Body, Which is Even Assumed
in Them.</head>
<p>The apostle indeed teaches, in his Epistle to the Colossians, that we were once dead,
alienated, and enemies to the Lord in our minds, whilst we were living in wicked works;7430
that we were then buried with Christ in baptism, and also raised again with Him through
the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised Him from the dead.7431 “And you, (adds
he), when ye were dead in sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath He quickened
together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses.”7432 And again: “If ye are dead with
Christ from the elements of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to
ordinances?”7433 Now, since he makes us spiritually dead—in such a way, however, as to
allow that we shall one day have to undergo a bodily death,—so, considering indeed that
we have been also raised in a like spiritual sense, he equally allows that we shall further have
to undergo a bodily resurrection. In so many words7434 he says: “Since ye are risen with
Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. Set
your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.”7435 Accordingly, it is in our
mind that he shows that we rise (with Christ), since it is by this alone that we are as yet able
to reach to heavenly objects. These we should not “seek,” nor “set our affection on,” if we
had them already in our possession. He also adds: “For ye are dead”—to your sins, he means,
not to yourselves—“and your life is hid with Christ in God.”7436 Now that life is not yet
apprehended which is hidden. In like manner John says: “And it doth not yet appear what
we shall be: we know, however, that when He shall be manifest, we shall be like Him.”7437
We are far indeed from being already what we know not of; we should, of course, be sure
to know it if we were already (like Him). It is therefore the contemplation of our blessed
hope even in this life by faith (that he speaks of)—not its presence nor its possession, but
only its expectation. Concerning this expectation and hope Paul writes to the Galatians:
“For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.”7438 He says “we wait

for it,” not we are in possession of it. By the righteousness of God, he means that judgment
which we shall have to undergo as the recompense of our deeds. It is in expectation of this
for himself that the apostle writes to the Philippians: “If by any means,” says he, “I might
attain to the resurrection of the dead. Not as though I had already attained, or were already
perfect.”7439 And yet he had believed, and had known all mysteries, as an elect vessel and
the great teacher of the Gentiles; but for all that he goes on to say: “I, however, follow on, if
so be I may apprehend that for which I also am apprehended of Christ.”7440 Nay, more:
“Brethren,” (he adds), “I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing (I do),
forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are
before, I press toward the mark for the prize of blamelessness,7441 whereby I may attain it;”
meaning the resurrection from the dead in its proper time. Even as he says to the Galatians:
“Let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap.”7442 Similarly, concerning
Onesiphorus, does he also write to Timothy: “The Lord grant unto him that he may find
mercy in that day;”7443 unto which day and time he charges Timothy himself “to keep what
had been committed to his care, without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of the Lord
Jesus Christ: which in His times He shall show, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the
King of kings and Lord of lords,”7444 speaking of (Him as) God. It is to these same times
that Peter in the Acts refers, when he says: “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your
sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the
Lord; and He shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: whom the
heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by
the mouth of His holy prophets.”7445</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—Other Passages Quoted from St. Paul, Which Categorically Assert
the Resurrection of the Flesh at the Final Judgment.</head>
<p>The character of these times learn, along with the Thessalonians. For we read: “How ye
turned from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for His Son from heaven,
whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus.”7446 And again: “For what is our hope, or joy,
or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord God, Jesus Christ, at His
coming?”7447 Likewise: “Before God, even our Father, at the coming of the Lord Jesus
Christ, with the whole company of His saints.”7448 He teaches them that they must “not
sorrow concerning them that are asleep,” and at the same time explains to them the times
of the resurrection, saying, “For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them
also which sleep in Jesus shall God bring with Him. For this we say unto you by the word
of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of our Lord, shall not
prevent them that are asleep. For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,
with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise
first: then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds,
to meet the Lord in the air; and so shall we be ever with the Lord.”7449 What archangel’s
voice, (I wonder), what trump of God is now heard, except it be, forsooth, in the entertainments
of the heretics? For, allowing that the word of the gospel may be called “the trump
of God,” since it was still calling men, yet they must at that time either be dead as to the
body, that they may be able to rise again; and then how are they alive? Or else caught up
into the clouds; and how then are they here? “Most miserable,” no doubt, as the apostle declared
them, are they “who in this life only” shall be found to have hope:7450 they will have
to be excluded while they are with premature haste seizing that which is promised after this
life; erring concerning the truth, no less than Phygellus and Hermogenes.7451 Hence it is
that the Holy Ghost, in His greatness, foreseeing clearly all such interpretations as these,
suggests (to the apostle), in this very epistle of his to the Thessalonians, as follows: “But of
the times and the seasons, brethren, there is no necessity for my writing unto you. For ye
yourselves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord cometh as a thief in the night. For when
they shall say, ‘Peace,’ and ‘All things are safe,’ then sudden destruction shall come upon
them.”7452 Again, in the second epistle he addresses them with even greater earnestness:

“Now I beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering
together unto Him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, nor be troubled, either by spirit, or
by word,” that is, the word of false prophets, “or by letter,” that is, the letter of false apostles,
“as if from us, as that the day of the Lord is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means.
For that day shall not come, unless indeed there first come a falling away,” he means indeed
of this present empire, “and that man of sin be revealed,” that is to say, Antichrist, “the son
of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or religion; so
that he sitteth in the temple of God, affirming that he is God. Remember ye not, that when
I was with you, I used to tell you these things? And now ye know what detaineth, that he
might be revealed in his time. For the mystery of iniquity doth already work; only he who
now hinders must hinder, until he be taken out of the way.”7453 What obstacle is there but
the Roman state, the falling away of which, by being scattered into ten kingdoms, shall introduce
Antichrist upon (its own ruins)? “And then shall be revealed the wicked one, whom
the Lord shall consume with the spirit of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness
of His coming: even him whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and
signs, and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—St. John, in the Apocalypse, Equally Explicit in Asserting the Same
Great Doctrine.</head>
<p>In the Revelation of John, again, the order of these times is spread out to view, which
“the souls of the martyrs” are taught to wait for beneath the altar, whilst they earnestly pray
to be avenged and judged:7455 (taught, I say, to wait), in order that the world may first drink
to the dregs the plagues that await it out of the vials of the angels,7456 and that the city of
fornication may receive from the ten kings its deserved doom,7457 and that the beast Antichrist
with his false prophet may wage war on the Church of God; and that, after the casting
of the devil into the bottomless pit for a while,7458 the blessed prerogative of the first resurrection
may be ordained from the thrones;7459 and then again, after the consignment of
him to the fire, that the judgment of the final and universal resurrection may be determined
out of the books.7460 Since, then, the Scriptures both indicate the stages of the last times,
and concentrate the harvest of the Christian hope in the very end of the world, it is evident,
either that all which God promises to us receives its accomplishment then, and thus what
the heretics pretend about a resurrection here falls to the ground; or else, even allowing that
a confession of the mystery (of divine truth) is a resurrection, that there is, without any
detriment to this view, room for believing in that which is announced for the end. It moreover
follows, that the very maintenance of this spiritual resurrection amounts to a presumption
in favour of the other bodily resurrection; for if none were announced for that time, there
would be fair ground for asserting only this purely spiritual resurrection. Inasmuch, however,
as (a resurrection) is proclaimed for the last time, it is proved to be a bodily one, because
there is no spiritual one also then announced. For why make a second announcement of a
resurrection of only one character, that is, the spiritual one, since this ought to be undergoing
accomplishment either now, without any regard to different times, or else then, at the very
conclusion of all the periods? It is therefore more competent for us even to maintain a
spiritual resurrection at the commencement of a life of faith, who acknowledge the full
completion thereof at the end of the world.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVI.—Even the Metaphorical Descriptions of This Subject in the Scriptures
Point to the Bodily Resurrection, the Only Sense Which Secures Their Consistency
and Dignity.</head>
<p>To a preceding objection, that the Scriptures are allegorical, I have still one answer to
make—that it is open to us also to defend the bodily character of the resurrection by means
of the language of the prophets, which is equally figurative. For consider that primeval
sentence which God spake when He called man earth; saying, “Earth thou art, and to earth
shalt thou return.”7461 In respect, of course, to his fleshly substance, which had been taken
out of the ground, and which was the first to receive the name of man, as we have already
shown,7462 does not this passage give one instruction to interpret in relation to the flesh
also whatever of wrath or of grace God has determined for the earth, because, strictly
speaking, the earth is not exposed to His judgment, since it has never done any good or evil?
“Cursed,” no doubt, it was, for it drank the blood of man;7463 but even this was as a figure
of homicidal flesh. For if the earth has to suffer either joy or injury, it is simply on man’s
account, that he may suffer the joy or the sorrow through the events which happen to his
dwelling-place, whereby he will rather have to pay the penalty which, simply on his account,
even the earth must suffer. When, therefore, God even threatens the earth, I would prefer
saying that He threatens the flesh: so likewise, when He makes a promise to the earth, I
would rather understand Him as promising the flesh; as in that passage of David: “The Lord
is King, let the earth be glad,”7464—meaning the flesh of the saints, to which appertains the
enjoyment of the kingdom of God. Then he afterwards says: “The earth saw and trembled;
the mountains melted like wax at the presence of the Lord,”—meaning, no doubt the flesh
of the wicked; and (in a similar sense) it is written: “For they shall look on Him whom they
pierced.”7465 If indeed it will be thought that both these passages were pronounced simply
of the element earth, how can it be consistent that it should shake and melt at the presence
of the Lord, at whose royal dignity it before exulted? So again in Isaiah, “Ye shall eat the
good of the land,”7466 the expression means the blessings which await the flesh when in the
kingdom of God it shall be renewed, and made like the angels, and waiting to obtain the
things “which neither eye hath seen, nor ear heard, and which have not entered into the
heart of man.”7467 Otherwise, how vain that God should invite men to obedience by the

fruits of the field and the elements of this life, when He dispenses these to even irreligious
men and blasphemers; on a general condition once for all made to man, “sending rain on
the good and on the evil, and making His sun to shine on the just and on the unjust!”7468
Happy, no doubt, is faith, if it is to obtain gifts which the enemies of God and Christ not
only use, but even abuse, “worshipping the creature itself in opposition to the Creator!”7469
You will reckon, (I suppose) onions and truffles among earth’s bounties, since the Lord
declares that “man shall not live on bread alone!”7470 In this way the Jews lose heavenly
blessings, by confining their hopes to earthly ones, being ignorant of the promise of heavenly
bread, and of the oil of God’s unction, and the wine of the Spirit, and of that water of life
which has its vigour from the vine of Christ. On exactly the same principle, they consider
the special soil of Judæa to be that very holy land, which ought rather to be interpreted of
the Lord’s flesh, which, in all those who put on Christ, is thenceforward the holy land; holy
indeed by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, truly flowing with milk and honey by the
sweetness of His assurance, truly Judæan by reason of the friendship of God. For “he is not
a Jew which is one outwardly, but he who is one inwardly.”7471 In the same way it is that
both God’s temple and Jerusalem (must be understood) when it is said by Isaiah: “Awake,
awake, O Jerusalem! put on the strength of thine arm; awake, as in thine earliest time,”7472
that is to say, in that innocence which preceded the fall into sin. For how can words of this
kind of exhortation and invitation be suitable for that Jerusalem which killed the prophets,
and stoned those that were sent to them, and at last crucified its very Lord? Neither indeed
is salvation promised to any one land at all, which must needs pass away with the fashion
of the whole world. Even if anybody should venture strongly to contend that paradise is the
holy land, which it may be possible to designate as the land of our first parents Adam and
Eve, it will even then follow that the restoration of paradise will seem to be promised to the
flesh, whose lot it was to inhabit and keep it, in order that man may be recalled thereto just
such as he was driven from it.</p>

<head>Chapter XXVII.—Certain Metaphorical Terms Explained of the Resurrection of the
Flesh.</head>
<p>We have also in the Scriptures robes mentioned as allegorizing the hope of the flesh.
Thus in the Revelation of John it is said: “These are they which have not defiled their clothes
with women,”7473—indicating, of course, virgins, and such as have become “eunuchs for
the kingdom of heaven’s sake.”7474 Therefore they shall be “clothed in white raiment,”7475
that is, in the bright beauty of the unwedded flesh. In the gospel even, “the wedding garment”
may be regarded as the sanctity of the flesh.7476 And so, when Isaiah tells us what sort of
“fast the Lord hath chosen,” and subjoins a statement about the reward of good works, he
says: “Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy garments,7477 shall speedily
arise;”7478 where he has no thought of cloaks or stuff gowns, but means the rising of the
flesh, which he declared the resurrection of, after its fall in death. Thus we are furnished
even with an allegorical defence of the resurrection of the body. When, then, we read, “Go,
my people, enter into your closets for a little season, until my anger pass away,”7479 we have
in the closets graves, in which they will have to rest for a little while, who shall have at the
end of the world departed this life in the last furious onset of the power of Antichrist. Why
else did He use the expression closets, in preference to some other receptacle, if it were not
that the flesh is kept in these closets or cellars salted and reserved for use, to be drawn out
thence on a suitable occasion? It is on a like principle that embalmed corpses are set aside
for burial in mausoleums and sepulchres, in order that they may be removed therefrom
when the Master shall order it. Since, therefore, there is consistency in thus understanding
the passage (for what refuge of little closets could possibly shelter us from the wrath of
God?), it appears that by the very phrase which he uses, “Until His anger pass away,”7480
which shall extinguish Antichrist, he in fact shows that after that indignation the flesh will
come forth from the sepulchre, in which it had been deposited previous to the bursting out
of the anger. Now out of the closets nothing else is brought than that which had been put

and also by deeds, is the resurrection foretold. When Moses puts his hand into his bosom,
and then draws it out again dead, and again puts his hand into his bosom, and plucks it out
living,7481 does not this apply as a presage to all mankind?—inasmuch as those three signs7482
denoted the threefold power of God: when it shall, first, in the appointed order, subdue to
man the old serpent, the devil,7483 however formidable; then, secondly, draw forth the flesh
from the bosom of death;7484 and then, at last, shall pursue all blood (shed) in judgment.7485
On this subject we read in the writings of the same prophet, (how that) God says: “For your
blood of your lives will I require of all wild beasts; and I will require it of the hand of man,
and of his brother’s hand.”7486 Now nothing is required except that which is demanded
back again, and nothing is thus demanded except that which is to be given up; and that will
of course be given up, which shall be demanded and required on the ground of vengeance.
But indeed there cannot possibly be punishment of that which never had any existence.
Existence, however, it will have, when it is restored in order to be punished. To the flesh,
therefore, applies everything which is declared respecting the blood, for without the flesh
there cannot be blood. The flesh will be raised up in order that the blood may be punished.
There are, again, some statements (of Scripture) so plainly made as to be free from all obscurity
of allegory, and yet they strongly require7487 their very simplicity to be interpreted.
There is, for instance, that passage in Isaiah: “I will kill, and I will make alive.”7488 Certainly
His making alive is to take place after He has killed. As, therefore, it is by death that He kills,
it is by the resurrection that He will make alive. Now it is the flesh which is killed by death;
the flesh, therefore, will be revived by the resurrection. Surely if killing means taking away
life from the flesh, and its opposite, reviving, amounts to restoring life to the flesh, it must
needs be that the flesh rise again, to which the life, which has been taken away by killing,
has to be restored by vivification.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIX.—Ezekiel’s Vision of the Dry Bones Quoted.</head>
<p>Inasmuch, then, as even the figurative portions of Scripture, and the arguments of facts,
and some plain statements of Holy Writ, throw light upon the resurrection of the flesh (al-
though without specially naming the very substance), how much more effectual for determining
the question will not those passages be which indicate the actual substance of the
body by expressly mentioning it! Take Ezekiel: “And the hand of the Lord,” says he, “was
upon me; and the Lord brought me forth in the Spirit, and set me in the midst of a plain
which was full of bones; and He led me round about them in a circuit: and, behold, there
were many on the face of the plain; and, lo, they were very dry. And He said unto me, Son
of man, will these bones live? And I said, O Lord God, Thou knowest. And He said unto
me, Prophesy upon these bones; and thou shalt say, Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.
Thus saith the Lord God to these bones, Behold, I bring upon you the breath of life, and ye
shall live: and I will give unto you the spirit, and I will place muscles over you, and I will
spread skin upon you; and ye shall live, and shall know that I am the Lord. And I prophesied
as the Lord commanded me: and while I prophesy, behold there is a voice, behold also a
movement, and bones approached bones. And I saw, and behold sinews and flesh came up
over them, and muscles were placed around them; but there was no breath in them. And
He said unto me, Prophesy to the wind, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord
God, Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe in these dead men, and let them
live. So I prophesied to the wind, as He commanded me, and the spirit entered into the
bones, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, strong and exceeding many. And the Lord
said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. They say themselves,
Our bones are become dry, and our hope is perished, and we in them have been violently
destroyed. Therefore prophesy unto them, (and say), Behold, even I will open your sepulchres,
and will bring you out of your sepulchres, O my people, and will bring you into the
land of Israel: and ye shall know how that I the Lord opened your sepulchres, and brought
you, O my people, out of your sepulchres; and I will give my Spirit unto you, and ye shall
live, and shall rest in your own land: and ye shall know how that I the Lord have spoken
and done these things, saith the Lord.”7489</p>

<head>Chapter XXX.—This Vision Interpreted by Tertullian of the Resurrection of the
Bodies of the Dead. A Chronological Error of Our Author, Who Supposes that
Ezekiel in His Ch. XXXI. Prophesied Before the Captivity.</head>
<p>I am well aware how they torture even this prophecy into a proof of the allegorical sense,
on the ground that by saying, “These bones are the whole house of Israel,” He made them
a figure of Israel, and removed them from their proper literal condition; and therefore (they
contend) that there is here a figurative, not a true prediction of the resurrection, for (they
say) the state of the Jews is one of humiliation, in a certain sense dead, and very dry, and
dispersed over the plain of the world. Therefore the image of a resurrection is allegorically
applied to their state, since it has to be gathered together, and recompacted bone to bone
(in other words, tribe to tribe, and people to people), and to be reincorporated by the sinews
of power and the nerves of royalty, and to be brought out as it were from sepulchres, that
is to say, from the most miserable and degraded abodes of captivity, and to breathe afresh
in the way of a restoration, and to live thenceforward in their own land of Judæa. And what
is to happen after all this? They will die, no doubt. And what will there be after death? No
resurrection from the dead, of course, since there is nothing of the sort here revealed to
Ezekiel. Well, but the resurrection is elsewhere foretold: so that there will be one even in
this case, and they are rash in applying this passage to the state of Jewish affairs; or even if
it do indicate a different recovery from the resurrection which we are maintaining, what
matters it to me, provided there be also a resurrection of the body, just as there is a restoration
of the Jewish state? In fact, by the very circumstance that the recovery of the Jewish state is
prefigured by the reincorporation and reunion of bones, proof is offered that this event will
also happen to the bones themselves; for the metaphor could not have been formed from
bones, if the same thing exactly were not to be realized in them also. Now, although there
is a sketch of the true thing in its image, the image itself still possesses a truth of its own: it
must needs be, therefore, that must have a prior existence for itself, which is used figuratively
to express some other thing. Vacuity is not a consistent basis for a similitude, nor does
nonentity form a suitable foundation for a parable. It will therefore be right to believe that
the bones are destined to have a rehabiliment of flesh and breath, such as it is here said they
will have, by reason indeed of which their renewed state could alone express the reformed
condition of Jewish affairs, which is pretended to be the meaning of this passage. It is,
however, more characteristic of a religious spirit to maintain the truth on the authority of
a literal interpretation, such as is required by the sense of the inspired passage. Now, if this
vision had reference to the condition of the Jews, as soon as He had revealed to him the
position of the bones, He would at once have added, “These bones are the whole house of
Israel,” and so forth. But immediately on showing the bones, He interrupts the scene by
saying somewhat of the prospect which is most suited to bones; without yet naming Israel,

<pb n="1265"/>
He tries the prophet’s own faith: “Son of man, can these bones ever live?” so that he makes
answer: “O Lord, Thou knowest.” Now God would not, you may be sure, have tried the
prophet’s faith on a point which was never to be a real one, of which Israel should never
hear, and in which it was not proper to repose belief. Since, however, the resurrection of
the dead was indeed foretold, but Israel, in the distrust of his great unbelief, was offended
at it; and, whilst gazing on the condition of the crumbling grave, despaired of a resurrection;
or rather, did not direct his mind mainly to it, but to his own harassing circumstances,—therefore
God first instructed the prophet (since he, too, was not free from doubt), by revealing
to him the process of the resurrection, with a view to his earnest setting forth of the same.
He then charged the people to believe what He had revealed to the prophet, telling them
that they were themselves, though refusing to believe their resurrection, the very bones
which were destined to rise again. Then in the concluding sentence He says, “And ye shall
know how that I the Lord have spoken and done these things,” intending of course to do
that of which He had spoken; but certainly not meaning to do that which He had spoken
of, if His design had been to do something different from what He had said.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXI.—Other Passages Out of the Prophets Applied to the Resurrection
of the Flesh.</head>
<p>Unquestionably, if the people were indulging in figurative murmurs that their bones
were become dry, and that their hope had perished—plaintive at the consequences of their
dispersion—then God might fairly enough seem to have consoled their figurative despair
with a figurative promise. Since, however, no injury had as yet alighted on the people from
their dispersion, although the hope of the resurrection had very frequently failed amongst
them, it is manifest that it was owing to the perishing condition of their bodies that their
faith in the resurrection was shaken. God, therefore, was rebuilding the faith which the
people were pulling down. But even if it were true that Israel was then depressed at some
shock in their existing circumstances, we must not on that account suppose that the purpose
of revelation could have rested in a parable: its aim must have been to testify a resurrection,
in order to raise the nation’s hope to even an eternal salvation and an indispensable restoration,
and thereby turn off their minds from brooding over their present affairs. This indeed
is the aim of other prophets likewise. “Ye shall go forth,” (says Malachi), “from your sepulchres,
as young calves let loose from their bonds, and ye shall tread down your enemies.”
7490 And again, (Isaiah says): “Your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall spring
up like the grass,”7491 because the grass also is renewed by the dissolution and corruption
of the seed. In a word, if it is contended that the figure of the rising bones refers properly
to the state of Israel, why is the same hope announced to all nations, instead of being limited
to Israel only, of reinvesting those osseous remains with bodily substance and vital breath,
and of raising up their dead out of the grave? For the language is universal: “The dead shall
arise, and come forth from their graves; for the dew which cometh from Thee is medicine
to their bones.”7492 In another passage it is written: “All flesh shall come to worship before
me, saith the Lord.”7493 When? When the fashion of this world shall begin to pass away.
For He said before: “As the new heaven and the new earth, which I make, remain before
me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed remain.”7494 Then also shall be fulfilled what is written
afterwards: “And they shall go forth” (namely, from their graves), “and shall see the carcases
of those who have transgressed: for their worm shall never die, nor shall their fire be
quenched; and they shall be a spectacle to all flesh”7495 even to that which, being raised

<head>Chapter XXXII.—Even Unburied Bodies Will Be Raised Again. Whatever Befalls
Them God Will Restore Them Again. Jonah’s Case Quoted in Illustration of
God’s Power.</head>
<p>But, that you may not suppose that it is merely those bodies which are consigned to
tombs whose resurrection is foretold, you have it declared in Scripture: “And I will com
mand the fishes of the sea, and they shall cast up the bones which they have devoured; and
I will bring joint to joint, and bone to bone.” You will ask, Will then the fishes and other
animals and carnivorous birds be raised again, in order that they may vomit up what they
have consumed, on the ground of your reading in the law of Moses, that blood is required
of even all the beasts? Certainly not. But the beasts and the fishes are mentioned in relation
to the restoration of flesh and blood, in order the more emphatically to express the resurrection
of such bodies as have even been devoured, when redress is said to be demanded of
their very devourers. Now I apprehend that in the case of Jonah we have a fair proof of this
divine power, when he comes forth from the fish’s belly uninjured in both his natures—his
flesh and his soul. No doubt the bowels of the whale would have had abundant time during
three days for consuming and digesting Jonah’s flesh, quite as effectually as a coffin, or a
tomb, or the gradual decay of some quiet and concealed grave; only that he wanted to prefigure
even those beasts (which symbolize) especially the men who are wildly opposed to the
Christian name, or the angels of iniquity, of whom blood will be required by the full exaction
of an avenging judgment. Where, then, is the man who, being more disposed to learn than
to assume, more careful to believe than to dispute, and more scrupulous of the wisdom of
God than wantonly bent on his own, when he hears of a divine purpose respecting sinews
and skin, and nerves and bones, will forthwith devise some different application of these
words, as if all that is said of the substances in question were not naturally intended for
man? For either there is here no reference to the destiny of man—in the gracious provision
of the kingdom (of heaven), in the severity of the judgment-day, in all the incidents of the
resurrection; or else, if there is any reference to his destiny, the destination must necessarily
be made in reference to those substances of which the man is composed, for whom the
destiny is reserved. Another question I have also to ask of these very adroit transformers of
bones and sinews, and nerves and sepulchres: Why, when anything is declared of the soul,
do they not interpret the soul to be something else, and transfer it to another signification?—
since, whenever any distinct statement is made of a bodily substance, they will obstinately
prefer taking any other sense whatever, rather than that which the name indicates.
If things which pertain to the body are figurative, why are not those which pertain to the
soul figurative also? Since, however, things which belong to the soul have nothing allegorical
in them, neither therefore have those which belong to the body. For man is as much

<pb n="1269"/>
body as he is soul; so that it is impossible for one of these natures to admit a figurative sense,
and the other to exclude it.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIII.—So Much for the Prophetic Scriptures. In the Gospels, Christ’s
Parables, as Explained by Himself, Have a Clear Reference to the Resurrection
of the Flesh.</head>
<p>This is evidence enough from the prophetic Scriptures. I now appeal to the Gospels.
But here also I must first meet the same sophistry as advanced by those who contend that
the Lord, like (the prophets), said everything in the way of allegory, because it is written:
“All these things spake Jesus in parables, and without a parable spake He not unto them,”7496
that is, to the Jews. Now the disciples also asked Him, “Why speakest Thou in parables?”7497
And the Lord gave them this answer: “Therefore I speak unto them in parables: because
they seeing, see not; and hearing, they hear not, according to the prophecy of Esaias.”7498
But since it was to the Jews that He spoke in parables, it was not then to all men; and if not
to all, it follows that it was not always and in all things parables with Him, but only in certain
things, and when addressing a particular class. But He addressed a particular class when He
spoke to the Jews. It is true that He spoke sometimes even to the disciples in parables. But
observe how the Scripture relates such a fact: “And He spake a parable unto them.”7499 It
follows, then, that He did not usually address them in parables; because if He always did so,
special mention would not be made of His resorting to this mode of address. Besides, there
is not a parable which you will not find to be either explained by the Lord Himself, as that
of the sower, (which He interprets) of the management of the word of God;7500 or else
cleared by a preface from the writer of the Gospel, as in the parable of the arrogant judge
and the importunate widow, which is expressly applied to earnestness in prayer;7501 or capable
of being spontaneously understood,7502 as in the parable of the fig-tree, which was spared
a while in hopes of improvement—an emblem of Jewish sterility. Now, if even parables
obscure not the light of the gospel, how unlikely it is that plain sentences and declarations,
which have an unmistakeable meaning, should signify any other thing than their literal
sense! But it is by such declarations and sentences that the Lord sets forth either the last
judgment, or the kingdom, or the resurrection: “It shall be more tolerable,” He says, “for
Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.”7503 And “Tell them that the kingdom

<pb n="1271"/>
of God is at hand.”7504 And again, “It shall be recompensed to you at the resurrection of
the just.”7505 Now, if the mention of these events (I mean the judgment-day, and the kingdom
of God, and the resurrection) has a plain and absolute sense, so that nothing about them
can be pressed into an allegory, neither should those statements be forced into parables
which describe the arrangement, and the process, and the experience of the kingdom of
God, and of the judgment, and of the resurrection. On the contrary, things which are destined
for the body should be carefully understood in a bodily sense,—not in a spiritual sense, as
having nothing figurative in their nature. This is the reason why we have laid it down as a
preliminary consideration, that the bodily substance both of the soul and of the flesh is liable
to the recompense, which will have to be awarded in return for the co-operation of the two
natures, that so the corporeality of the soul may not exclude the bodily nature of the flesh
by suggesting a recourse to figurative descriptions, since both of them must needs be regarded
as destined to take part in the kingdom, and the judgment, and the resurrection. And now
we proceed to the special proof of this proposition, that the bodily character of the flesh is
indicated by our Lord whenever He mentions the resurrection, at the same time without
disparagement to the corporeal nature of the soul,—a point which has been actually admitted
but by a few.</p>

<pb n="1272"/>
<head>Chapter XXXIV.—Christ Plainly Testifies to the Resurrection of the Entire Man.
Not in His Soul Only, Without the Body.</head>
<p>To begin with the passage where He says that He is come to “to seek and to save that
which is lost.”7506 What do you suppose that to be which is lost? Man, undoubtedly. The
entire man, or only a part of him? The whole man, of course. In fact, since the transgression
which caused man’s ruin was committed quite as much by the instigation of the soul from
concupiscence as by the action of the flesh from actual fruition, it has marked the entire
man with the sentence of transgression, and has therefore made him deservedly amenable
to perdition. So that he will be wholly saved, since he has by sinning been wholly lost. Unless
it be true that the sheep (of the parable) is a “lost” one, irrespective of its body; then its recovery
may be effected without the body. Since, however, it is the bodily substance as well
as the soul, making up the entire animal, which was carried on the shoulders of the Good
Shepherd, we have here unquestionably an example how man is restored in both his natures.
Else how unworthy it were of God to bring only a moiety of man to salvation—and almost
less than that; whereas the munificence of princes of this world always claims for itself the
merit of a plenary grace! Then must the devil be understood to be stronger for injuring man,
ruining him wholly? and must God have the character of comparative weakness, since He
does not relieve and help man in his entire state? The apostle, however, suggests that “where
sin abounded, there has grace much more abounded.”7507 How, in fact, can he be regarded
as saved, who can at the same time be said to be lost—lost, that is, in the flesh, but saved as
to his soul? Unless, indeed, their argument now makes it necessary that the soul should be
placed in a “lost” condition, that it may be susceptible of salvation, on the ground that is
properly saved which has been lost. We, however, so understand the soul’s immortality as
to believe it “lost,” not in the sense of destruction, but of punishment, that is, in hell. And
if this is the case, then it is not the soul which salvation will affect, since it is “safe” already
in its own nature by reason of its immortality, but rather the flesh, which, as all readily allow,
is subject to destruction. Else, if the soul is also perishable (in this sense), in other words,
not immortal—the condition of the flesh—then this same condition ought in all fairness to
benefit the flesh also, as being similarly mortal and perishable, since that which perishes the
Lord purposes to save. I do not care now to follow the clue of our discussion, so far as to
consider whether it is in one of his natures or in the other that perdition puts in its claim
on man, provided that salvation is equally distributed over the two substances, and makes
him its aim in respect of them both. For observe, in which substance so-ever you assume
man to have perished, in the other he does not perish. He will therefore be saved in the
<note type="footnote">7506 Luke xix. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">7507 Rom. v. 20.</note>

<pb n="1273"/>
substance in which he does not perish, and yet obtain salvation in that in which he does
perish. You have (then) the restoration of the entire man, inasmuch as the Lord purposes
to save that part of him which perishes, whilst he will not of course lose that portion which
cannot be lost. Who will any longer doubt of the safety of both natures, when one of them
is to obtain salvation, and the other is not to lose it? And, still further, the Lord explains to
us the meaning of the thing when He says: “I came not to do my own will, but the Father’s,
who hath sent me.”7508 What, I ask, is that will? “That of all which He hath given me I should
lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.”7509 Now, what had Christ received
of the Father but that which He had Himself put on? Man, of course, in his texture of flesh
and soul. Neither, therefore, of those parts which He has received will He allow to perish;
nay, no considerable portion—nay, not the least fraction, of either. If the flesh be, as our
opponents slightingly think, but a poor fraction, then the flesh is safe, because not a fraction
of man is to perish; and no larger portion is in danger, because every portion of man is in
equally safe keeping with Him. If, however, He will not raise the flesh also up at the last day,
then He will permit not only a fraction of man to perish, but (as I will venture to say, in
consideration of so important a part) almost the whole of him. But when He repeats His
words with increased emphasis, “And this is the Father’s will, that every one which seeth
the Son, and believeth on Him, may have eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last
day,”7510—He asserts the full extent of the resurrection. For He assigns to each several
nature that reward which is suited to its services: both to the flesh, for by it the Son was
“seen;” and to the soul, for by it He was “believed on.” Then, you will say, to them was this
promise given by whom Christ was “seen.” Well, be it so; only let the same hope flow on
from them to us! For if to them who saw, and therefore believed, such fruit then accrued to
the operations of the flesh and the soul, how much more to us! For more “blessed,” says
Christ, “are they who have not seen, and yet have believed;”7511 since, even if the resurrection
of the flesh must be denied to them, it must at any rate be a fitting boon to us, who are the
more blessed. For how could we be blessed, if we were to perish in any part of us?</p>

<head>Chapter XXXV.—Explanation of What is Meant by the Body, Which is to Be Raised
Again. Not the Corporeality of the Soul.</head>
<p>But He also teaches us, that “He is rather to be feared, who is able to destroy both body
and soul in hell,” that is, the Lord alone; “not those which kill the body, but are not able to
hurt the soul,”7512 that is to say, all human powers. Here, then, we have a recognition of the
natural immortality of the soul, which cannot be killed by men; and of the mortality of the
body, which may be killed: whence we learn that the resurrection of the dead is a resurrection
of the flesh; for unless it were raised again, it would be impossible for the flesh to be “killed
in hell.” But as a question may be here captiously raised about the meaning of “the body”
(or “the flesh”), I will at once state that I understand by the human body nothing else than
that fabric of the flesh which, whatever be the kind of material of which it is constructed
and modified, is seen and handled, and sometimes indeed killed, by men. In like manner,
I should not admit that anything but cement and stones and bricks form the body of a wall.
If any one imports into our argument some body of a subtle, secret nature, he must show,
disclose, and prove to me that that identical body is the very one which was slain by human
violence, and then (I will grant) that it is of such a body that (our scripture) speaks. If, again,
the body or corporeal nature of the soul7513 is cast in my teeth, it will only be an idle subterfuge!
For since both substances are set before us (in this passage, which affirms) that “body
and soul” are destroyed in hell, a distinction is obviously made between the two; and we are
left to understand the body to be that which is tangible to us, that is, the flesh, which, as it
will be destroyed in hell—since it did not “rather fear” being destroyed by God—so also will
it be restored to life eternal, since it preferred to be killed by human hands. If, therefore, any
one shall violently suppose that the destruction of the soul and the flesh in hell amounts to
a final annihilation of the two substances, and not to their penal treatment (as if they were
to be consumed, not punished), let him recollect that the fire of hell is eternal—expressly
announced as an everlasting penalty; and let him then admit that it is from this circumstance
that this never-ending “killing” is more formidable than a merely human murder, which is
only temporal. He will then come to the conclusion that substances must be eternal, when
their penal “killing” is an eternal one. Since, then, the body after the resurrection has to be
killed by God in hell along with the soul, we surely have sufficient information in this fact
respecting both the issues which await it, namely the resurrection of the flesh, and its
eternal “killing.” Else it would be most absurd if the flesh should be raised up and destined
to “the killing in hell,” in order to be put an end to, when it might suffer such an annihilation

(more directly) if not raised again at all. A pretty paradox,7514 to be sure, that an essence
must be refitted with life, in order that it may receive that annihilation which has already
in fact accrued to it! But Christ, whilst confirming us in the selfsame hope, adds the example
of “the sparrows”—how that “not one of them falls to the ground without the will of God.”7515
He says this, that you may believe that the flesh which has been consigned to the ground, is
able in like manner to rise again by the will of the same God. For although this is not allowed
to the sparrows, yet “we are of more value than many sparrows,”7516 for the very reason
that, when fallen, we rise again. He affirms, lastly, that “the very hairs of our head are all
numbered,”7517 and in the affirmation He of course includes the promise of their safety;
for if they were to be lost, where would be the use of having taken such a numerical care of
them? Surely the only use lies (in this truth): “That of all which the Father hath given to me,
I should lose none,”7518—not even a hair, as also not an eye nor a tooth. And yet whence
shall come that “weeping and gnashing of teeth,”7519 if not from eyes and teeth?—even at
that time when the body shall be slain in hell, and thrust out into that outer darkness which
shall be the suitable torment of the eyes. He also who shall not be clothed at the marriage
feast in the raiment of good works, will have to be “bound hand and foot,”—as being, of
course, raised in his body. So, again, the very reclining at the feast in the kingdom of God,
and sitting on Christ’s thrones, and standing at last on His right hand and His left, and eating
of the tree of life: what are all these but most certain proofs of a bodily appointment and
destination?</p>

<head>Chapter XXXVI.—Christ’s Refutation of the Sadducees, and Affirmation of Catholic
Doctrine.</head>
<p>Let us now see whether (the Lord) has not imparted greater strength to our doctrine in
breaking down the subtle cavil of the Sadducees. Their great object, I take it, was to do away
altogether with the resurrection, for the Sadducees in fact did not admit any salvation either
for the soul or the flesh;7520 and therefore, taking the strongest case they could for impairing
the credibility of the resurrection, they adapted an argument from it in support of the
question which they started. Their specious inquiry concerned the flesh, whether or not it
would be subject to marriage after the resurrection; and they assumed the case of a woman
who had married seven brothers, so that it was a doubtful point to which of them she should
be restored.7521 Now, let the purport both of the question and the answer be kept steadily
in view, and the discussion is settled at once. For since the Sadducees indeed denied the resurrection,
whilst the Lord affirmed it; since, too, (in affirming it,) He reproached them as
being both ignorant of the Scriptures—those, of course which had declared the resurrection—
as well as incredulous of the power of God, though, of course, effectual to raise the
dead, and lastly, since He immediately added the words, “Now, that the dead are raised,”7522
(speaking) without misgiving, and affirming the very thing which was being denied, even
the resurrection of the dead before Him who is “the God of the living,”—(it clearly follows)
that He affirmed this verity in the precise sense in which they were denying it; that it was,
in fact, the resurrection of the two natures of man. Nor does it follow, (as they would have
it,) that because Christ denied that men would marry, He therefore proved that they would
not rise again. On the contrary, He called them “the children of the resurrection,”7523 in a
certain sense having by the resurrection to undergo a birth; and after that they marry no
more, but in their risen life are “equal unto the angels,”7524 inasmuch as they are not to
marry, because they are not to die, but are destined to pass into the angelic state by putting
on the raiment of incorruption, although with a change in the substance which is restored
to life. Besides, no question could be raised whether we are to marry or die again or not,
without involving in doubt the restoration most especially of that substance which has a
particular relation both to death and marriage—that is, the flesh. Thus, then, you have the

<head>Chapter XXXVII.—Christ’s Assertion About the Unprofitableness of the Flesh Explained
Consistently with Our Doctrine.</head>
<p>He says, it is true, that “the flesh profiteth nothing;”7525 but then, as in the former case,
the meaning must be regulated by the subject which is spoken of. Now, because they thought
His discourse was harsh and intolerable, supposing that He had really and literally enjoined
on them to eat his flesh, He, with the view of ordering the state of salvation as a spiritual
thing, set out with the principle, “It is the spirit that quickeneth;” and then added, “The flesh
profiteth nothing,”—meaning, of course, to the giving of life. He also goes on to explain
what He would have us to understand by spirit: “The words that I speak unto you, they are
spirit, and they are life.” In a like sense He had previously said: “He that heareth my words,
and believeth on Him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation,
but shall pass from death unto life.”7526 Constituting, therefore, His word as the
life-giving principle, because that word is spirit and life, He likewise called His flesh by the
same appellation; because, too, the Word had become flesh,7527 we ought therefore to desire
Him in order that we may have life, and to devour Him with the ear, and to ruminate on
Him with the understanding, and to digest Him by faith. Now, just before (the passage in
hand), He had declared His flesh to be “the bread which cometh down from heaven,”7528
impressing on (His hearers) constantly under the figure of necessary food the memory of
their forefathers, who had preferred the bread and flesh of Egypt to their divine calling.7529
Then, turning His subject to their reflections, because He perceived that they were going to
be scattered from Him, He says: “The flesh profiteth nothing.” Now what is there to destroy
the resurrection of the flesh? As if there might not reasonably enough be something which,
although it “profiteth nothing” itself, might yet be capable of being profited by something
else. The spirit “profiteth,” for it imparts life. The flesh profiteth nothing, for it is subject to
death. Therefore He has rather put the two propositions in a way which favours our belief:
for by showing what “profits,” and what “does not profit,” He has likewise thrown light on
the object which receives as well as the subject which gives the “profit.” Thus, in the present
instance, we have the Spirit giving life to the flesh which has been subdued by death; for “the
hour,” says He, “is coming, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they
that hear shall live.”7530 Now, what is “the dead” but the flesh? and what is “the voice of

God” but the Word? and what is the Word but the Spirit,7531 who shall justly raise the flesh
which He had once Himself become, and that too from death, which He Himself suffered,
and from the grave, which He Himself once entered? Then again, when He says, “Marvel
not at this: for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of
the Son of God, and shall come forth; they that have done good, to the resurrection of life;
and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation,”7532—none will after such
words be able to interpret the dead “that are in the graves” as any other than the bodies of
the flesh, because the graves themselves are nothing but the resting-place of corpses: for it
is incontestable that even those who partake of “the old man,” that is to say, sinful men—in
other words, those who are dead through their ignorance of God (whom our heretics, forsooth,
foolishly insist on understanding by the word “graves”7533)—are plainly here spoken
of as having to come from their graves for judgment. But how are graves to come forth from
graves?</p>

<head>Chapter XXXVIII.—Christ, by Raising the Dead, Attested in a Practical Way the
Doctrine of the Resurrection of the Flesh.</head>
<p>After the Lord’s words, what are we to think of the purport of His actions, when He
raises dead persons from their biers and their graves? To what end did He do so? If it was
only for the mere exhibition of His power, or to afford the temporary favour of restoration
to life, it was really no great matter for Him to raise men to die over again. If, however, as
was the truth, it was rather to put in secure keeping men’s belief in a future resurrection,
then it must follow from the particular form of His own examples, that the said resurrection
will be a bodily one. I can never allow it to be said that the resurrection of the future, being
destined for the soul only, did then receive these preliminary illustrations of a raising of the
flesh, simply because it would have been impossible to have shown the resurrection of an
invisible soul except by the resuscitation of a visible substance. They have but a poor
knowledge of God, who suppose Him to be only capable of doing what comes within the
compass of their own thoughts; and after all, they cannot but know full well what His capability
has ever been, if they only make acquaintance with the writings of John. For unquestionably
he, who has exhibited to our sight the martyrs’ hitherto disembodied souls resting
under the altar,7534 was quite able to display them before our eyes rising without a body of
flesh. I, however, for my part prefer (believing) that it is impossible for God to practise deception
(weak as He only could be in respect of artifice), from any fear of seeming to have
given preliminary proofs of a thing in a way which is inconsistent with His actual disposal
of the thing; nay more, from a fear that, since He was not powerful enough to show us a
sample of the resurrection without the flesh, He might with still greater infirmity be unable
to display (by and by) the full accomplishment of the sample in the self-same substance of
the flesh. No example, indeed, is greater than the thing of which it is a sample. Greater,
however, it is, if souls with their body are to be raised as the evidence of their resurrection
without the body, so as that the entire salvation of man in soul and body should become a
guarantee for only the half, the soul; whereas the condition in all examples is, that which
would be deemed the less—I mean the resurrection of the soul only—should be the foretaste,
as it were, of the rising of the flesh also at its appointed time. And therefore, according to
our estimate of the truth, those examples of dead persons who were raised by the Lord were
indeed a proof of the resurrection both of the flesh and of the soul,—a proof, in fact, that
this gift was to be denied to neither substance. Considered, however, as examples only, they
expressed all the less significance—less, indeed, than Christ will express at last—for they
were not raised up for glory and immortality, but only for another death.</p>

<head>Chapter XXXIX.—Additional Evidence Afforded to Us in the Acts of the Apostles.</head>
<p>The Acts of the Apostles, too, attest7535 the resurrection. Now the apostles had nothing
else to do, at least among the Jews, than to explain7536 the Old Testament and confirm7537
the New, and above all, to preach God in Christ. Consequently they introduced nothing
new concerning the resurrection, besides announcing it to the glory of Christ: in every
other respect it had been already received in simple and intelligent faith, without any question
as to what sort of resurrection it was to be, and without encountering any other opponents
than the Sadducees. So much easier was it to deny the resurrection altogether, than to understand
it in an alien sense. You find Paul confessing his faith before the chief priests, under
the shelter of the chief captain,7538 among the Sadducees and the Pharisees: “Men and
brethren,” he says, “I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; of the hope and resurrection of
the dead I am now called in question by you,”7539—referring, of course, to the nation’s hope;
in order to avoid, in his present condition, as an apparent transgressor of the law, being
thought to approach to the Sadducees in opinion on the most important article of the
faith—even the resurrection. That belief, therefore, in the resurrection which he would not
appear to impair, he really confirmed in the opinion of the Pharisees, since he rejected the
views of the Sadducees, who denied it. In like manner, before Agrippa also, he says that he
was advancing “none other things than those which the prophets had announced.”7540 He
was therefore maintaining just such a resurrection as the prophets had foretold. He mentions
also what is written by “Moses,” touching the resurrection of the dead; (and in so doing) he
must have known that it would be a rising in the body, since requisition will have to be made
therein of the blood of man.7541 He declared it then to be of such a character as the Pharisees
had admitted it, and such as the Lord had Himself maintained it, and such too as the Sadducees
refused to believe it—such refusal leading them indeed to an absolute rejection of
the whole verity. Nor had the Athenians previously understood Paul to announce any other
resurrection.7542 They had, in fact, derided his announcement; but they would have indulged
no such derision if they had heard from him nothing but the restoration of the soul, for they
would have received that as the very common anticipation of their own native philosophy.

absolute novelty excited the heathen, and a not unnatural incredulity in so wonderful a
matter began to harass the simple faith with many discussions, then the apostle took care
in almost every one of his writings to strengthen men’s belief of this Christian hope, pointing
out that there was such a hope, and that it had not as yet been realized, and that it would be
in the body,—a point which was the especial object of inquiry, and, what was besides a
doubtful question, not in a body of a different kind from ours.</p>

<head>Chapter XL.—Sundry Passages of St. Paul Which Attest Our Doctrine Rescued from
the Perversions of Heresy.</head>
<p>Now it is no matter of surprise if arguments are captiously taken from the writings of
(the apostle) himself, inasmuch as there “must needs be heresies;”7543 but these could not
be, if the Scriptures were not capable of a false interpretation. Well, then, heresies finding
that the apostle had mentioned two “men”—“the inner man,” that is, the soul, and “the
outward man,” that is, the flesh—awarded salvation to the soul or inward man, and destruction
to the flesh or outward man, because it is written (in the Epistle) to the Corinthians:
“Though our outward man decayeth, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.”7544 Now,
neither the soul by itself alone is “man” (it was subsequently implanted in the clayey mould
to which the name man had been already given), nor is the flesh without the soul “man”:
for after the exile of the soul from it, it has the title of corpse. Thus the designation man is,
in a certain sense, the bond between the two closely united substances, under which designation
they cannot but be coherent natures. As for the inward man, indeed, the apostle
prefers its being regarded as the mind and heart7545 rather than the soul;7546 in other words,
not so much the substance itself as the savour of the substance. Thus when, writing to the
Ephesians, he spoke of “Christ dwelling in their inner man,” he meant, no doubt, that the
Lord ought to be admitted into their senses.7547 He then added, “in your hearts by faith,
rooted and grounded in love,”—making “faith” and “love” not substantial parts, but only
conceptions of the soul. But when he used the phrase “in your hearts,” seeing that these are
substantial parts of the flesh, he at once assigned to the flesh the actual “inward man,” which
he placed in the heart. Consider now in what sense he alleged that “the outward man decayeth,
while the inward man is renewed day by day.” You certainly would not maintain
that he could mean that corruption of the flesh which it undergoes from the moment of
death, in its appointed state of perpetual decay; but the wear and tear which for the name
of Christ it experiences during its course of life before and until death, in harassing cares
and tribulations as well as in tortures and persecutions. Now the inward man will have, of
course, to be renewed by the suggestion of the Spirit, advancing by faith and holiness day
after day, here in this life, not there after the resurrection, were our renewal is not a gradual
process from day to day, but a consummation once for all complete. You may learn this,
too, from the following passage, where the apostle says: “For our light affliction, which is
but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while

we look not at the things which are seen,” that is, our sufferings, “but at the things which
are not seen,” that is, our rewards: “for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things
which are not seen are eternal.”7548 For the afflictions and injuries wherewith the outward
man is worn away, he affirms to be only worthy of being despised by us, as being light and
temporary; preferring those eternal recompenses which are also invisible, and that “weight
of glory” which will be a counterpoise for the labours in the endurance of which the flesh
here suffers decay. So that the subject in this passage is not that corruption which they ascribe
to the outward man in the utter destruction of the flesh, with the view of nullifying the resurrection.
So also he says elsewhere: “If so be that we suffer with Him, that we may be also
glorified together; for I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be
compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us.”7549 Here again he shows us that our
sufferings are less than their rewards. Now, since it is through the flesh that we suffer with
Christ—for it is the property of the flesh to be worn by sufferings—to the same flesh belongs
the recompense which is promised for suffering with Christ. Accordingly, when he is going
to assign afflictions to the flesh as its especial liability—according to the statement he had
already made—he says, “When we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest;”7550
then, in order to make the soul a fellow-sufferer with the body, he adds, “We were troubled
on every side; without were fightings,” which of course warred down the flesh, “within were
fears,” which afflicted the soul.7551 Although, therefore, the outward man decays—not in
the sense of missing the resurrection, but of enduring tribulation—it will be understood
from this scripture that it is not exposed to its suffering without the inward man. Both
therefore, will be glorified together, even as they have suffered together. Parallel with their
participation in troubles, must necessarily run their association also in rewards.</p>

<head>Chapter XLI.—The Dissolution of Our Tabernacle Consistent with the Resurrection
of Our Bodies.</head>
<p>It is still the same sentiment which he follows up in the passage in which he puts the
recompense above the sufferings: “for we know;” he says, “that if our earthly house of this
tabernacle were dissolved, we have a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens;”7552
in other words, owing to the fact that our flesh is undergoing dissolution through its sufferings,
we shall be provided with a home in heaven. He remembered the award (which the
Lord assigns) in the Gospel: “Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”7553 Yet, when he thus contrasted the recompense of
the reward, he did not deny the flesh’s restoration; since the recompense is due to the same
substance to which the dissolution is attributed,—that is, of course, the flesh. Because,
however, he had called the flesh a house, he wished elegantly to use the same term in his
comparison of the ultimate reward; promising to the very house, which undergoes dissolution
through suffering, a better house through the resurrection. Just as the Lord also promises
us many mansions as of a house in His Father’s home;7554 although this may possibly be
understood of the domicile of this world, on the dissolution of whose fabric an eternal abode
is promised in heaven, inasmuch as the following context, having a manifest reference to
the flesh, seems to show that these preceding words have no such reference. For the apostle
makes a distinction, when he goes on to say, “For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be
clothed upon with our house which is from heaven, if so be that being clothed we shall not
be found naked;”7555 which means, before we put off the garment of the flesh, we wish to
be clothed with the celestial glory of immortality. Now the privilege of this favour awaits
those who shall at the coming of the Lord be found in the flesh, and who shall, owing to the
oppressions of the time of Antichrist, deserve by an instantaneous death,7556 which is accomplished
by a sudden change, to become qualified to join the rising saints; as he writes
to the Thessalonians: “For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are
alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For
the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel,
and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we too shall ourselves
be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we
ever be with the Lord.”7557</p>

<head>Chapter XLII.—Death Changes, Without Destroying, Our Mortal Bodies. Remains
of the Giants.</head>
<p>It is the transformation these shall undergo which he explains to the Corinthians, when
he writes: “We shall all indeed rise again (though we shall not all undergo the transformation)
in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump”—for none shall experience this
change but those only who shall be found in the flesh. “And the dead,” he says, “shall be
raised, and we shall be changed.” Now, after a careful consideration of this appointed order,
you will be able to adjust what follows to the preceding sense. For when he adds, “This
corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality,”7558 this
will assuredly be that house from heaven, with which we so earnestly desire to be clothed
upon, whilst groaning in this our present body,—meaning, of course, over this flesh in which
we shall be surprised at last; because he says that we are burdened whilst in this tabernacle,
which we do not wish indeed to be stripped of, but rather to be in it clothed over, in such a
way that mortality may be swallowed up of life, that is, by putting on over us whilst we are
transformed that vestiture which is from heaven. For who is there that will not desire, while
he is in the flesh, to put on immortality, and to continue his life by a happy escape from
death, through the transformation which must be experienced instead of it, without encountering
too that Hades which will exact the very last farthing?7559 Notwithstanding, he who
has already traversed Hades is destined also to obtain the change after the resurrection. For
from this circumstance it is that we definitively declare that the flesh will by all means rise
again, and, from the change that is to come over it, will assume the condition of angels.
Now, if it were merely in the case of those who shall be found in the flesh that the change
must be undergone, in order that mortality may be swallowed up of life—in other words,
that the flesh (be covered) with the heavenly and eternal raiment—it would either follow
that those who shall be found in death would not obtain life, deprived as they would then
be of the material and so to say the aliment of life, that is, the flesh; or else, these also must
needs undergo the change, that in them too mortality may be swallowed up of life, since it
is appointed that they too should obtain life. But, you say, in the case of the dead, mortality
is already swallowed up of life. No, not in all cases, certainly. For how many will most
probably be found of men who had just died—so recently put into their graves, that nothing
in them would seem to be decayed? For you do not of course deem a thing to be decayed
unless it be cut off, abolished, and withdrawn from our perception, as having in every possible
way ceased to be apparent. There are the carcases of the giants of old time; it will be obvious
enough that they are not absolutely decayed, for their bony frames are still extant. We have

already spoken of this elsewhere.7560 For instance,7561 even lately in this very city,7562 when
they were sacrilegiously laying the foundations of the Odeum on a good many ancient graves,
people were horror-stricken to discover, after some five hundred years, bones, which still
retained their moisture, and hair which had not lost its perfume. It is certain not only that
bones remain indurated, but also that teeth continue undecayed for ages—both of them the
lasting germs of that body which is to sprout into life again in the resurrection. Lastly, even
if everything that is mortal in all the dead shall then be found decayed—at any rate consumed
by death, by time, and through age,—is there nothing which will be “swallowed up of life,”7563
nor by being covered over and arrayed in the vesture of immortality? Now, he who says that
mortality is going to be swallowed up of life has already admitted that what is dead is not
destroyed by those other before-mentioned devourers. And verily it will be extremely fit that
all shall be consummated and brought about by the operations of God, and not by the laws
of nature. Therefore, inasmuch as what is mortal has to be swallowed up of life, it must
needs be brought out to view in order to be so swallowed up; (needful) also to be swallowed
up, in order to undergo the ultimate transformation. If you were to say that a fire is to be
lighted, you could not possibly allege that what is to kindle it is sometimes necessary and
sometimes not. In like manner, when he inserts the words “If so be that being unclothed7564
we be not found naked,”7565—referring, of course, to those who shall not be found in the
day of the Lord alive and in the flesh—he did not say that they whom he had just described
as unclothed or stripped, were naked in any other sense than meaning that they should be
understood to be reinvested with the very same substance they had been divested of. For
although they shall be found naked when their flesh has been laid aside, or to some extent
sundered or worn away (and this condition may well be called nakedness,) they shall afterwards
recover it again, in order that, being reinvested with the flesh, they may be able also
to have put over that the supervestment of immortality; for it will be impossible for the
outside garment to fit except over one who is already dressed.</p>

<head>Chapter XLIII.—No Disparagement of Our Doctrine in St. Paul’s Phrase, Which
Calls Our Residence in the Flesh Absence from the Lord.</head>
<p>In the same way, when he says, “Therefore we are always confident, and fully aware,
that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord; for we walk by faith, not
be sight,”7566 it is manifest that in this statement there is no design of disparaging the flesh,
as if it separated us from the Lord. For there is here pointedly addressed to us an exhortation
to disregard this present life, since we are absent from the Lord as long as we are passing
through it—walking by faith, not by sight; in other words, in hope, not in reality. Accordingly
he adds: “We are indeed confident and deem it good rather to be absent from the body, and
present with the Lord;”7567 in order, that is, that we may walk by sight rather than by faith,
in realization rather than in hope. Observe how he here also ascribes to the excellence of
martyrdom a contempt for the body. For no one, on becoming absent from the body, is at
once a dweller in the presence of the Lord, except by the prerogative of martyrdom,7568 he
gains a lodging in Paradise, not in the lower regions. Now, had the apostle been at a loss for
words to describe the departure from the body? Or does he purposely use a novel phraseo-
logy? For, wanting to express our temporary absence from the body, he says that we are
strangers, absent from it, because a man who goes abroad returns after a while to his home.
Then he says even to all: “We therefore earnestly desire to be acceptable unto God, whether
absent or present; for we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ Jesus.”7569 If
all of us, then all of us wholly; if wholly, then our inward man and outward too—that is, our
bodies no less than our souls. “That every one,” as he goes on to say, “may receive the things
done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.”7570 Now I
ask, how do you read this passage? Do you take it to be confusedly constructed, with a
transposition7571 of ideas? Is the question about what things will have to be received by the
body, or the things which have been already done in the body? Well, if the things which are
to be borne by the body are meant, then undoubtedly a resurrection of the body is implied;
and if the things which have been already done in the body are referred to, (the same conclusion
follows): for of course the retribution will have to be paid by the body, since it was
by the body that the actions were performed. Thus the apostle’s whole argument from the
beginning is unravelled in this concluding clause, wherein the resurrection of the flesh is

of Our Doctrine.</head>
<p>Now, if you will examine the words which precede the passage where mention is made
of the outward and the inward man, will you not discover the whole truth, both of the dignity
and the hope of the flesh? For, when he speaks of the “light which God hath commanded
to shine in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of the Lord in the person
of Jesus Christ,”7572 and says that “we have this treasure in earthen vessels,”7573 meaning
of course the flesh, which is meant—that the flesh shall be destroyed, because it is “an earthen
vessel,” deriving its origin from clay; or that it is to be glorified, as being the receptacle of a
divine treasure? Now if that true light, which is in the person of Christ, contains in itself
life, and that life with its light is committed to the flesh, is that destined to perish which has
life entrusted to it? Then, of course, the treasure will perish also; for perishable things are
entrusted to things which are themselves perishable, which is like putting new wine into
old bottles. When also he adds, “Always bearing about in our body the dying of the Lord
Jesus Christ,”7574 what sort of substance is that which, after (being called) the temple of
God, can now be also designated the tomb of Christ? But why do we bear about in the body
the dying of the Lord? In order, as he says, “that His life also may be manifested.”7575 Where?
“In the body.” In what body? “In our mortal body.”7576 Therefore in the flesh, which is
mortal indeed through sin, but living through grace—how great a grace you may see when
the purpose is, “that the life of Christ may be manifested in it.” Is it then in a thing which
is a stranger to salvation, in a substance which is perpetually dissolved, that the life of Christ
will be manifested, which is eternal, continuous, incorruptible, and already the life of God?
Else to what epoch belongs that life of the Lord which is to be manifested in our body? It
surely is the life which He lived up to His passion, which was not only openly shown among
the Jews, but has now been displayed even to all nations. Therefore that life is meant which
“has broken the adamantine gates of death and the brazen bars of the lower world,”7577—a
life which thenceforth has been and will be ours. Lastly, it is to be manifested in the body.
When? After death. How? By rising in our body, as Christ also rose in His. But lest any one
should here object, that the life of Jesus has even now to be manifested in our body by the
discipline of holiness, and patience, and righteousness, and wisdom, in which the Lord’s
life abounded, the most provident wisdom of the apostle inserts this purpose: “For we which

live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that His life may be manifested in our
mortal body.”7578 In us, therefore, even when dead, does he say that this is to take place in
us. And if so, how is this possible except in our body after its resurrection? Therefore he
adds in the concluding sentence: “Knowing that He which raised up the Lord Jesus, shall
raise up us also with Him,”7579 risen as He is already from the dead. But perhaps “with
Him” means “like Him:” well then, if it be like Him, it is not of course without the flesh.</p>

<head>Chapter XLV.—The Old Man and the New Man of St. Paul Explained.</head>
<p>But in their blindness they again impale themselves on the point of the old and the new
man. When the apostle enjoins us “to put off the old man, which is corrupt according to
the deceitful lusts; and to be renewed in the spirit of our mind; and to put on the new man,
which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness,”7580 (they maintain) that by
here also making a distinction between the two substances, and applying the old one to the
flesh and the new one to the spirit, he ascribes to the old man—that is to say, the flesh—a
permanent corruption. Now, if you follow the order of the substances, the soul cannot be
the new man because it comes the later of the two; nor can the flesh be the old man because
it is the former. For what fraction of time was it that intervened between the creative hand
of God and His afflatus? I will venture to say, that even if the soul was a good deal prior to
the flesh, by the very circumstance that the soul had to wait to be itself completed, it made
the other7581 really the former. For everything which gives the finishing stroke and perfection
to a work, although it is subsequent in its mere order, yet has the priority in its effect. Much
more is that prior, without which preceding things could have no existence. If the flesh be
the old man, when did it become so? From the beginning? But Adam was wholly a new
man, and of that new man there could be no part an old man. And from that time, ever
since the blessing which was pronounced upon man’s generation,7582 the flesh and the soul
have had a simultaneous birth, without any calculable difference in time; so that the two
have been even generated together in the womb, as we have shown in our Treatise on the
Soul.7583 Contemporaneous in the womb, they are also temporally identical in their birth.
The two are no doubt produced by human parents7584 of two substances, but not at two
different periods; rather they are so entirely one, that neither is before the other in point of
time. It is more correct (to say), that we are either entirely the old man or entirely the new,
for we cannot tell how we can possibly be anything else. But the apostle mentions a very
clear mark of the old man. For “put off,” says he, “concerning the former conversation, the
old man;”7585 (he does) not say concerning the seniority of either substance. It is not indeed
the flesh which he bids us to put off, but the works which he in another passage shows to
be “works of the flesh.”7586 He brings no accusation against men’s bodies, of which he even
writes as follows: “Putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are

members one of another. Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:
neither give place to the devil. Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour,
working with his hands (the thing which is good), that he may have to give to him that
needeth. Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good
for the edification of faith, that it may minister grace unto the hearers. And grieve not the
Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption. Let all bitterness,
and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:
but be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ
hath forgiven you.”7587 Why, therefore, do not those who suppose the flesh to be the old
man, hasten their own death, in order that by laying aside the old man they may satisfy the
apostle’s precepts? As for ourselves, we believe that the whole of faith is to be administered
in the flesh, nay more, by the flesh, which has both a mouth for the utterance of all holy
words, and a tongue to refrain from blasphemy, and a heart to avoid all irritation, and hands
to labour and to give; while we also maintain that as well the old man as the new has relation
to the difference of moral conduct, and not to any discrepancy of nature. And just as we
acknowledge that that which according to its former conversation was “the old man” was
also corrupt, and received its very name in accordance with “its deceitful lusts,” so also (do
we hold) that it is “the old man in reference to its former conversation,”7588 and not in respect
of the flesh through any permanent dissolution. Moreover, it is still unimpaired in the flesh,
and identical in that nature, even when it has become “the new man;” since it is of its sinful
course of life, and not of its corporeal substance, that it has been divested.</p>

<head>Chapter XLVI.—It is the Works of the Flesh, Not the Substance of the Flesh, Which
St. Paul Always Condemns.</head>
<p>You may notice that the apostle everywhere condemns the works of the flesh in such a
way as to appear to condemn the flesh; but no one can suppose him to have any such view
as this, since he goes on to suggest another sense, even though somewhat resembling it. For
when he actually declares that “they who are in the flesh cannot please God,” he immediately
recalls the statement from an heretical sense to a sound one, by adding, “But ye are not in
the flesh, but in the Spirit.”7589 Now, by denying them to be in the flesh who yet obviously
were in the flesh, he showed that they were not living amidst the works of the flesh, and
therefore that they who could not please God were not those who were in the flesh, but only
those who were living after the flesh; whereas they pleased God, who, although existing in
the flesh, were yet walking after the Spirit. And, again, he says that “the body is dead;” but
it is “because of sin,” even as “the Spirit is life because of righteousness.”7590 When, however,
he thus sets life in opposition to the death which is constituted in the flesh, he unquestionably
promises the life of righteousness to the same state for which he determined the death of
sin. But unmeaning is this opposition which he makes between the “life” and the “death,”
if the life is not there where that very thing is to which he opposes it—even the death which
is to be extirpated of course from the body. Now, if life thus extirpates death from the body,
it can accomplish this only by penetrating thither where that is which it is excluding. But
why am I resorting to knotty arguments,7591 when the apostle treats the subject with perfect
plainness? “For if,” says he, “the Spirit of Him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
you, He that raised up Jesus from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies, because
of His Spirit that dwelleth in you;”7592 so that even if a person were to assume that the soul
is “the mortal body,” he would (since he cannot possibly deny that the flesh is this also) be
constrained to acknowledge a restoration even of the flesh, in consequence of its participation
in the selfsame state. From the following words, moreover, you may learn that it is the
works of the flesh which are condemned, and not the flesh itself: “Therefore, brethren, we
are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh: for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die; but
if ye, through the Spirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.”7593 Now (that I
may answer each point separately), since salvation is promised to those who are living in
the flesh, but walking after the Spirit, it is no longer the flesh which is an adversary to salvation,
but the working of the flesh. When, however, this operativeness of the flesh is done

away with, which is the cause of death, the flesh is shown to be safe, since it is freed from
the cause of death. “For the law,” says he, “of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me
free from the law of sin and death,”7594—that, surely, which he previously mentioned as
dwelling in our members.7595 Our members, therefore, will no longer be subject to the law
of death, because they cease to serve that of sin, from both which they have been set free.
“For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own
Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and through7596 sin condemned sin in the flesh,”7597—not
the flesh in sin, for the house is not to be condemned with its inhabitant. He said, indeed,
that “sin dwelleth in our body.”7598 But the condemnation of sin is the acquittal of the flesh,
just as its non-condemnation subjugates it to the law of sin and death. In like manner, he
called “the carnal mind” first “death,”7599 and afterwards “enmity against God;”7600 but he
never predicated this of the flesh itself. But to what then, you will say, must the carnal mind
be ascribed, if it be not to the carnal substance itself? I will allow your objection, if you will
prove to me that the flesh has any discernment of its own. If, however, it has no conception
of anything without the soul, you must understand that the carnal mind must be referred
to the soul, although ascribed sometimes to the flesh, on the ground that it is ministered to
for the flesh and through the flesh. And therefore (the apostle) says that “sin dwelleth in the
flesh,” because the soul by which sin is provoked has its temporary lodging in the flesh,
which is doomed indeed to death, not however on its own account, but on account of sin.
For he says in another passage also: “How is it that you conduct yourselves as if you were
even now living in the world?”7601 where he is not writing to dead persons, but to those
who ought to have ceased to live after the ways of the world.</p>

<head>Chapter XLVII.—St. Paul, All Through, Promises Eternal Life to the Body.</head>
<p>For that must be living after the world, which, as the old man, he declares to be “crucified
with Christ,”7602 not as a bodily structure, but as moral behaviour. Besides, if we do not
understand it in this sense, it is not our bodily frame which has been transfixed (at all events),
nor has our flesh endured the cross of Christ; but the sense is that which he has subjoined,
“that the body of sin might be made void,”7603 by an amendment of life, not by a destruction
of the substance, as he goes on to say, “that henceforth we should not serve sin;”7604 and
that we should believe ourselves to be “dead with Christ,” in such a manner as that “we shall
also live with Him.”7605 On the same principle he says: “Likewise reckon ye also yourselves
to be dead indeed.”7606 To what? To the flesh? No, but “unto sin.”7607 Accordingly as to
the flesh they will be saved—“alive unto God in Christ Jesus,”7608 through the flesh of course,
to which they will not be dead; since it is “unto sin,” and not to the flesh, that they are dead.
For he pursues the point still further: “Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that
ye should obey it, and that ye should yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness
unto sin: but yield ye yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead”—not simply
alive, but as alive from the dead—“and your members as instruments of righteousness.”7609
And again: “As ye have yielded your members servants of uncleanness, and of iniquity unto
iniquity, even so now yield your members servants of righteousness unto holiness; for whilst
ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness. What fruit had ye then in those
things of which ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death. But now, being
made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the
end everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through
Jesus Christ our Lord.”7610 Thus throughout this series of passages, whilst withdrawing our
members from unrighteousness and sin, and applying them to righteousness and holiness,
and transferring the same from the wages of death to the donative of eternal life, he undoubtedly
promises to the flesh the recompense of salvation. Now it would not at all have
been consistent that any rule of holiness and righteousness should be especially enjoined

for the flesh, if the reward of such a discipline were not also within its reach; nor could even
baptism be properly ordered for the flesh, if by its regeneration a course were not inaugurated
tending to its restitution; the apostle himself suggesting this idea: “Know ye not, that so
many of us as are baptized into Jesus Christ, are baptized into His death? We are therefore
buried with Him by baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised up from the dead,
even so we also should walk in newness of life.”7611 And that you may not suppose that this
is said merely of that life which we have to walk in the newness of, through baptism, by faith,
the apostle with superlative forethought adds: “For if we have been planted together in the
likeness of Christ’s death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection.”7612 By a figure
we die in our baptism, but in a reality we rise again in the flesh, even as Christ did, “that, as
sin has reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness unto life eternal,
through Jesus Christ our Lord.”7613 But how so, unless equally in the flesh? For where the
death is, there too must be the life after the death, because also the life was first there, where
the death subsequently was. Now, if the dominion of death operates only in the dissolution
of the flesh, in like manner death’s contrary, life, ought to produce the contrary effect, even
the restoration of the flesh; so that, just as death had swallowed it up in its strength, it also,
after this mortal was swallowed up of immortality, may hear the challenge pronounced
against it: “O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?”7614 For in this way
“grace shall there much more abound, where sin once abounded.”7615 In this way also “shall
strength be made perfect in weakness,”7616—saving what is lost, reviving what is dead,
healing what is stricken, curing what is faint, redeeming what is lost, freeing what is enslaved,
recalling what has strayed, raising what is fallen; and this from earth to heaven, where, as
the apostle teaches the Philippians, “we have our citizenship,7617 from whence also we look
for our Saviour Jesus Christ, who shall change our body of humiliation, that it may be
fashioned like unto His glorious body”7618—of course after the resurrection, because Christ
Himself was not glorified before He suffered. These must be “the bodies” which he “be-

how a living sacrifice, if these bodies are to perish? How a holy one, if they are profanely
soiled? How acceptable to God, if they are condemned? Come, now, tell me how that passage
(in the Epistle) to the Thessalonians—which, because of its clearness, I should suppose to
have been written with a sunbeam—is understood by our heretics, who shun the light of
Scripture: “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly.” And as if this were not plain
enough, it goes on to say: “And may your whole body, and soul, and spirit be preserved
blameless unto the coming of the Lord.”7620 Here you have the entire substance of man
destined to salvation, and that at no other time than at the coming of the Lord, which is the
key of the resurrection.7621</p>

<p>But “flesh and blood,” you say, “cannot inherit the kingdom of God.”7622 We are quite
aware that this too is written; but although our opponents place it in the front of the battle,
we have intentionally reserved the objection until now, in order that we may in our last assault
overthrow it, after we have removed out of the way all the questions which are auxiliary to
it. However, they must contrive to recall to their mind even now our preceding arguments,
in order that the occasion which originally suggested this passage may assist our judgment
in arriving at its meaning. The apostle, as I take it, having set forth for the Corinthians the
details of their church discipline, had summed up the substance of his own gospel, and of
their belief in an exposition of the Lord’s death and resurrection, for the purpose of deducing
therefrom the rule of our hope, and the groundwork thereof. Accordingly he subjoins this
statement: “Now if Christ be preached that He rose from the dead, how say some among
you that there is no resurrection of the dead? If there be no resurrection of the dead, then
Christ is not risen: and if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is
also vain. Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God
that He raised up Christ, whom He raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. For if the
dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain, because
ye are yet in your sins, and they which have fallen asleep in Christ are perished.”7623 Now,
what is the point which he evidently labours hard to make us believe throughout this passage?
The resurrection of the dead, you say, which was denied: he certainly wished it to be believed
on the strength of the example which he adduced—the Lord’s resurrection. Certainly, you
say. Well now, is an example borrowed from different circumstances, or from like ones?
From like ones, by all means, is your answer. How then did Christ rise again? In the flesh,
or not? No doubt, since you are told that He “died according to the Scriptures,”7624 and
“that He was buried according to the Scriptures,”7625 no otherwise than in the flesh, you will
also allow that it was in the flesh that He was raised from the dead. For the very same body
which fell in death, and which lay in the sepulchre, did also rise again; (and it was) not so
much Christ in the flesh, as the flesh in Christ. If, therefore, we are to rise again after the
example of Christ, who rose in the flesh, we shall certainly not rise according to that example,
unless we also shall ourselves rise again in the flesh. “For,” he says, “since by man came
death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.”7626 (This he says) in order, on the

one hand, to distinguish the two authors—Adam of death, Christ of resurrection; and, on
the other hand, to make the resurrection operate on the same substance as the death, by
comparing the authors themselves under the designation man. For if “as in Adam all die,
even so in Christ shall all be made alive,”7627 their vivification in Christ must be in the flesh,
since it is in the flesh that arises their death in Adam. “But every man in his own order,”7628
because of course it will be also every man in his own body. For the order will be arranged
severally, on account of the individual merits. Now, as the merits must be ascribed to the
body, it must needs follow that the order also should be arranged in respect of the bodies,
that it may be in relation to their merits. But inasmuch as “some are also baptized for the
dead,”7629 we will see whether there be a good reason for this. Now it is certain that they
adopted this (practice) with such a presumption as made them suppose that the vicarious
baptism (in question) would be beneficial to the flesh of another in anticipation of the resur-
rection; for unless it were a bodily resurrection, there would be no pledge secured by this
process of a corporeal baptism. “Why are they then baptized for the dead,”7630 he asks, unless
the bodies rise again which are thus baptized? For it is not the soul which is sanctified by
the baptismal bath:7631 its sanctification comes from the “answer.”7632 “And why,” he inquires,
“stand we in jeopardy every hour?”7633—meaning, of course, through the flesh. “I
die daily,”7634 (says he); that is, undoubtedly, in the perils of the body, in which “he even
fought with beasts at Ephesus,”7635—even with those beasts which caused him such peril
and trouble in Asia, to which he alludes in his second epistle to the same church of Corinth:
“For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia,
that we were pressed above measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of
life.”7636 Now, if I mistake not, he enumerates all these particulars in order that in his unwillingness
to have his conflicts in the flesh supposed to be useless, he may induce an unfaltering
belief in the resurrection of the flesh. For useless must that conflict be deemed (which
is sustained in a body) for which no resurrection is in prospect. “But some man will say,
How are the dead to be raised? And with what body will they come?”7637 Now here he

discusses the qualities of bodies, whether it be the very same, or different ones, which men
are to resume. Since, however, such a question as this must be regarded as a subsequent
one, it will in passing be enough for us that the resurrection is determined to be a bodily
one even from this, that it is about the quality of bodies that the inquiry arises.</p>

<head>Chapter XLIX.—The Same Subject Continued. What Does the Apostle Exclude from
the Dead? Certainly Not the Substance of the Flesh.</head>
<p>We come now to the very gist7638 of the whole question: What are the substances, and
of what nature are they, which the apostle has disinherited of the kingdom of God? The
preceding statements give us a clue to this point also. He says: “The first man is of the earth,
earthy”—that is, made of dust, that is, Adam; “the second man is from heaven”7639—that
is, the Word of God, which is Christ, in no other way, however, man (although “from
heaven”), than as being Himself flesh and soul, just as a human being is, just as Adam was.
Indeed, in a previous passage He is called “the second Adam,”7640 deriving the identity of
His name from His participation in the substance, because not even Adam was flesh of human
seed, in which Christ is also like Him.7641 “As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy;
and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.”7642 Such (does he mean), in
substance; or first of all in training, and afterwards in the dignity and worth which that
training aimed at acquiring? Not in substance, however, by any means will the earthy and
the heavenly be separated, designated as they have been by the apostle once for all, as men.
For even if Christ were the only true “heavenly,” nay, super-celestial Being, He is still man,
as composed of body and soul; and in no respect is He separated from the quality of
“earthiness,” owing to that condition of His which makes Him a partaker of both substances.
In like manner, those also who after Him are heavenly, are understood to have this celestial
quality predicated of them not from their present nature, but from their future glory; because
in a preceding sentence, which originated this distinction respecting difference of dignity,
there was shown to be “one glory in celestial bodies, and another in terrestrial
ones,”7643—“one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the
stars: for even one star differeth from another star in glory,”7644 although not in substance.
Then, after having thus premised the difference in that worth or dignity which is even now
to be aimed at, and then at last to be enjoyed, the apostle adds an exhortation, that we should
both here in our training follow the example of Christ, and there attain His eminence in
glory: “As we have borne the image of the earthy, let us also bear the image of the heavenly.”
7645 We have indeed borne the image of the earthy, by our sharing in his transgression,

<pb n="1303"/>
by our participation in his death, by our banishment from Paradise. Now, although the
image of Adam is here borne by is in the flesh, yet we are not exhorted to put off the flesh;
but if not the flesh, it is the conversation, in order that we may then bear the image of the
heavenly in ourselves,—no longer indeed the image of God, and no longer the image of a
Being whose state is in heaven; but after the lineaments of Christ, by our walking here in
holiness, righteousness, and truth. And so wholly intent on the inculcation of moral conduct
is he throughout this passage, that he tells us we ought to bear the image of Christ in this
flesh of ours, and in this period of instruction and discipline. For when he says “let us bear”
in the imperative mood, he suits his words to the present life, in which man exists in no
other substance than as flesh and soul; or if it is another, even the heavenly, substance to
which this faith (of ours) looks forward, yet the promise is made to that substance to which
the injunction is given to labour earnestly to merit its reward. Since, therefore, he makes
the image both of the earthy and the heavenly consist of moral conduct—the one to be abjured,
and the other to be pursued—and then consistently adds, “For this I say” (on account,
that is, of what I have already said, because the conjunction “for” connects what follows
with the preceding words) “that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God,”7646—he
means the flesh and blood to be understood in no other sense than the before-mentioned
“image of the earthy;” and since this is reckoned to consist in “the old conversation,”7647
which old conversation receives not the kingdom of God, therefore flesh and blood, by not
receiving the kingdom of God, are reduced to the life of the old conversation. Of course, as
the apostle has never put the substance for the works of man, he cannot use such a construction
here. Since, however he has declared of men which are yet alive in the flesh, that they
“are not in the flesh,”7648 meaning that they are not living in the works of the flesh, you
ought not to subvert its form nor its substance, but only the works done in the substance
(of the flesh), alienating us from the kingdom of God. It is after displaying to the Galatians
these pernicious works that he professes to warn them beforehand, even as he had “told
them in time past, that they which do such things should not inherit the kingdom of
God,”7649 even because they bore not the image of the heavenly, as they had borne the image
of the earthy; and so, in consequence of their old conversation, they were to be regarded as
nothing else than flesh and blood. But even if the apostle had abruptly thrown out the sentence
that flesh and blood must be excluded from the kingdom of God, without any previous
intimation of his meaning, would it not have been equally our duty to interpret these two
substances as the old man abandoned to mere flesh and blood—in other words, to eating

and drinking, one feature of which would be to speak against the faith of the resurrection:
“Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.”7650 Now, when the apostle parenthetically
inserted this, he censured flesh and blood because of their enjoyment in eating and drinking.</p>

<head>Chapter L.—In What Sense Flesh and Blood are Excluded from the Kingdom of
God.</head>
<p>Putting aside, however, all interpretations of this sort, which criminate the works of the
flesh and blood, it may be permitted me to claim for the resurrection these very substances,
understood in none other than their natural sense. For it is not the resurrection that is directly
denied to flesh and blood, but the kingdom of God, which is incidental to7651 the resurrection
(for there is a resurrection of judgment7652 also); and there is even a confirmation of the
general resurrection of the flesh, whenever a special one is excepted. Now, when it is clearly
stated what the condition is to which the resurrection does not lead, it is understood what
that is to which it does lead; and, therefore, whilst it is in consideration of men’s merits that
a difference is made in their resurrection by their conduct in the flesh, and not by the substance
thereof, it is evident even from this, that flesh and blood are excluded from the
kingdom of God in respect of their sin, not of their substance; and although in respect of
their natural condition7653 they will rise again for the judgment, because they rise not for
the kingdom. Again, I will say, “Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God;”7654
and justly (does the apostle declare this of them, considered) alone and in themselves, in
order to show that the Spirit is still needed (to qualify them) for the kingdom.7655 For it is
“the Spirit that quickeneth” us for the kingdom of God; “the flesh profiteth nothing.”7656
There is, however, something else which can be profitable thereunto, that is, the Spirit; and
through the Spirit, the works also of the Spirit. Flesh and blood, therefore, must in every
case rise again, equally, in their proper quality. But they to whom it is granted to enter the
kingdom of God, will have to put on the power of an incorruptible and immortal life; for
without this, or before they are able to obtain it, they cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
With good reason, then, flesh and blood, as we have already said, by themselves fail to obtain
the kingdom of God. But inasmuch as “this corruptible (that is, the flesh) must put on incorruption,
and this mortal (that is, the blood) must put on immortality,”7657 by the change
which is to follow the resurrection, it will, for the best of reasons, happen that flesh and
blood, after that change and investiture,7658 will become able to inherit the kingdom of

blood,” because of its rite of circumcision, Judaism is meant, which is itself too alienated
from the kingdom of God, as being accounted “the old or former conversation,” and as being
designated by this title in another passage of the apostle also, who, “when it pleased God to
reveal to him His Son, to preach Him amongst the heathen, immediately conferred not with
flesh and blood,” as he writes to the Galatians,7659 (meaning by the phrase) the circumcision,
that is to say, Judaism.</p>

<head>Chapter LI.—The Session of Jesus in His Incarnate Nature at the Right Hand of God
a Guarantee of the Resurrection of Our Flesh.</head>
<p>That, however, which we have reserved for a concluding argument, will now stand as
a plea for all, and for the apostle himself, who in very deed would have to be charged with
extreme indiscretion, if he had so abruptly, as some will have it, and as they say, blindfold,
and so indiscriminately, and so unconditionally, excluded from the kingdom of God, and
indeed from the court of heaven itself, all flesh and blood whatsoever; since Jesus is still sitting
there at the right hand of the Father,7660 man, yet God—the last Adam,7661 yet the primary
Word—flesh and blood, yet purer than ours—who “shall descend in like manner as He ascended
into heaven”7662 the same both in substance and form, as the angels affirmed,7663
so as even to be recognised by those who pierced Him.7664 Designated, as He is, “the Mediator7665
between God and man,” He keeps in His own self the deposit of the flesh which
has been committed to Him by both parties—the pledge and security of its entire perfection.
For as “He has given to us the earnest of the Spirit,”7666 so has He received from us the
earnest of the flesh, and has carried it with Him into heaven as a pledge of that complete
entirety which is one day to be restored to it. Be not disquieted, O flesh and blood, with any
care; in Christ you have acquired both heaven and the kingdom of God. Otherwise, if they
say that you are not in Christ, let them also say that Christ is not in heaven, since they have
denied you heaven. Likewise “neither shall corruption,” says he, “inherit incorruption.”7667
This he says, not that you may take flesh and blood to be corruption, for they are themselves
rather the subjects of corruption,—I mean through death, since death does not so much
corrupt, as actually consume, our flesh and blood. But inasmuch as he had plainly said that
the works of the flesh and blood could not obtain the kingdom of God, with the view of
stating this with accumulated stress, he deprived corruption itself—that is, death, which
profits so largely by the works of the flesh and blood—from all inheritance of incorruption.
For a little afterwards, he has described what is, as it were, the death of death itself: “Death,”
says he, “is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
The sting of death is sin”—here is the corruption; “and the strength of sin is the law”7668—that

other law, no doubt, which he has described “in his members as warring against the law of
his mind,”7669—meaning, of course, the actual power of sinning against his will. Now he
says in a previous passage (of our Epistle to the Corinthians), that “the last enemy to be
destroyed is death.”7670 In this way, then, it is that corruption shall not inherit incorruption;
in other words, death shall not continue. When and how shall it cease? In that “moment,
that twinkling of an eye, at the last trump, when the dead shall rise incorruptible.”7671 But
what are these, if not they who were corruptible before—that is, our bodies; in other words,
our flesh and blood? And we undergo the change. But in what condition, if not in that
wherein we shall be found? “For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
must put on immortality.”7672 What mortal is this but the flesh? what corruptible but the
blood. Moreover, that you may not suppose the apostle to have any other meaning, in his
care to teach you, and that you may understand him seriously to apply his statement to the
flesh, when he says “this corruptible” and “this mortal,” he utters the words while touching
the surface of his own body.7673 He certainly could not have pronounced these phrases except
in reference to an object which was palpable and apparent. The expression indicates a bodily
exhibition. Moreover, a corruptible body is one thing, and corruption is another; so a mortal
body is one thing, and mortality is another. For that which suffers is one thing, and that
which causes it to suffer is another. Consequently, those things which are subject to corruption
and mortality, even the flesh and blood, must needs also be susceptible of incorruption
and immortality.</p>

<head>Chapter LII.—From St. Paul’s Analogy of the Seed We Learn that the Body Which
Died Will Rise Again, Garnished with the Appliances of Eternal Life.</head>
<p>Let us now see in what body he asserts that the dead will come. And with a felicitous
sally he proceeds at once to illustrate the point, as if an objector had plied him with some
such question. “Thou fool,” says he, “that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it
die.”7674 From this example of the seed it is then evident that no other flesh is quickened
than that which shall have undergone death, and therefore all the rest of the question will
become clear enough. For nothing which is incompatible with the idea suggested by the
example can possibly be understood; nor from the clause which follows, “That which thou
sowest, thou sowest not the body which shall be,”7675 are you permitted to suppose that in
the resurrection a different body is to arise from that which is sown in death. Otherwise
you have run away from the example. For if wheat be sown and dissolved in the ground,
barley does not spring up. Still it is not7676 the very same grain in kind; nor is its nature the
same, or its quality and form. Then whence comes it, if it is not the very same? For even the
decay is a proof of the thing itself, since it is the decay of the actual grain. Well, but does not
the apostle himself suggest in what sense it is that “the body which shall be” is not the body
which is sown, even when he says, “But bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other
grain; but God giveth it a body as it pleaseth Him?”7677 Gives it of course to the grain which
he says is sown bare. No doubt, you say. Then the grain is safe enough, to which God has
to assign a body. But how safe, if it is nowhere in existence, if it does not rise again if it rises
not again its actual self? If it rises not again, it is not safe; and if it is not even safe, it cannot
receive a body from God. But there is every possible proof that it is safe. For what purpose,
therefore, will God give it “a body, as it pleases Him,” even when it already has its own “bare”
body, unless it be that in its resurrection it may be no longer bare? That therefore will be
additional matter which is placed over the bare body; nor is that at all destroyed on which
the superimposed matter is put,—nay, it is increased. That, however, is safe which receives
augmentation. The truth is, it is sown the barest grain, without a husk to cover it, without
a spike even in germ, without the protection of a bearded top, without the glory of a stalk.
It rises, however, out of the furrow enriched with a copious crop, built up in a compact
fabric, constructed in a beautiful order, fortified by cultivation, and clothed around on every
side. These are the circumstances which make it another body from God, to which it is
changed not by abolition, but by amplification. And to every seed God has assigned its own

body7678—not, indeed, its own in the sense of its primitive body—in order that what it acquires
from God extrinsically may also at last be accounted its own. Cleave firmly then to
the example, and keep it well in view, as a mirror of what happens to the flesh: believe that
the very same flesh which was once sown in death will bear fruit in resurrection-life—the
same in essence, only more full and perfect; not another, although reappearing in another
form. For it shall receive in itself the grace and ornament which God shall please to spread
over it, according to its merits. Unquestionably it is in this sense that he says, “All flesh is
not the same flesh;”7679 meaning not to deny a community of substance, but a parity of
prerogative,—reducing the body to a difference of honour, not of nature. With this view he
adds, in a figurative sense, certain examples of animals and heavenly bodies: “There is one
flesh of man” (that is, servants of God, but really human), “another flesh of beasts” (that is,
the heathen, of whom the prophet actually says, “Man is like the senseless cattle”7680), “another
flesh of birds” (that is, the martyrs which essay to mount up to heaven), “another of
fishes” (that is, those whom the water of baptism has submerged).7681 In like manner does
he take examples from the heavenly bodies: “There is one glory of the sun” (that is, of Christ),
“and another glory of the moon” (that is, of the Church), “and another glory of the stars”
(in other words, of the seed of Abraham). “For one star differeth from another star in glory:
so there are bodies terrestrial as well as celestial” (Jews, that is, as well as Christians).7682
Now, if this language is not to be construed figuratively, it was absurd enough for him to
make a contrast between the flesh of mules and kites, as well as the heavenly bodies and
human bodies; for they admit of no comparison as to their condition, nor in respect of their
attainment of a resurrection. Then at last, having conclusively shown by his examples that
the difference was one of glory, not of substance, he adds: “So also is the resurrection of the
dead.”7683 How so? In no other way than as differing in glory only. For again, predicating
the resurrection of the same substance and returning once more to (his comparison of) the
grain, he says: “It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonour,
it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown a natural body, it
is raised a spiritual body.”7684 Now, certainly nothing else is raised than that which is sown;
and nothing else is sown than that which decays in the ground; and it is nothing else than
the flesh which is decayed in the ground. For this was the substance which God’s decree

demolished, “Earth thou art, and to earth shalt thou return;”7685 because it was taken out
of the earth. And it was from this circumstance that the apostle borrowed his phrase of the
flesh being “sown,” since it returns to the ground, and the ground is the grand depository
for seeds which are meant to be deposited in it, and again sought out of it. And therefore
he confirms the passage afresh, by putting on it the impress (of his own inspired authority),
saying, “For so it is written;”7686 that you may not suppose that the “being sown” means
anything else than “thou shalt return to the ground, out of which thou wast taken;” nor that
the phrase “for so it is written” refers to any other thing that the flesh.</p>

<head>Chapter LIII.—Not the Soul, But the Natural Body Which Died, is that Which is to
Rise Again. The Resurrection of Lazarus Commented on. Christ’s Resurrection,
as the Second Adam, Guarantees Our Own.</head>
<p>Some, however, contend that the soul is “the natural (or animate) body,”7687 with the
view of withdrawing the flesh from all connection with the risen body. Now, since it is a
clear and fixed point that the body which is to rise again is that which was sown in death,
they must be challenged to an examination of the very fact itself. Else let them show that
the soul was sown after death; in a word, that it underwent death,—that is, was demolished,
dismembered, dissolved in the ground, nothing of which was ever decreed against it by God:
let them display to our view its corruptibility and dishonour (as well as) its weakness, that
it may also accrue to it to rise again in incorruption, and in glory, and in power.7688 Now
in the case of Lazarus, (which we may take as) the palmary instance of a resurrection, the
flesh lay prostrate in weakness, the flesh was almost putrid in the dishonour of its decay, the
flesh stank in corruption, and yet it was as flesh that Lazarus rose again—with his soul, no
doubt. But that soul was incorrupt; nobody had wrapped it in its linen swathes; nobody had
deposited it in a grave; nobody had yet perceived it “stink;” nobody for four days had seen
it “sown.” Well, now, this entire condition, this whole end of Lazarus, the flesh indeed of
all men is still experiencing, but the soul of no one. That substance, therefore, to which the
apostle’s whole description manifestly refers, of which he clearly speaks, must be both the
natural (or animate) body when it is sown, and the spiritual body when it is raised again.
For in order that you may understand it in this sense, he points to this same conclusion,
when in like manner, on the authority of the same passage of Scripture, he displays to us
“the first man Adam as made a living soul.”7689 Now since Adam was the first man, since
also the flesh was man prior to the soul7690 it undoubtedly follows that it was the flesh that
became the living soul. Moreover, since it was a bodily substance that assumed this condition,
it was of course the natural (or animate) body that became the living soul. By what designation
would they have it called, except that which it became through the soul, except that
which it was not previous to the soul, except that which it can never be after the soul, but
through its resurrection? For after it has recovered the soul, it once more becomes the natural
(or animate) body, in order that it may become a spiritual body. For it only resumes in
<note type="footnote">7687 What in our version is rendered “a natural body,” is St. Paul’s σῶμα ψυχικόν, which the heretics held
to be merely a periphrasis for ψυχή. We have rendered Tertullian’s phrase corpus animale by “animate body,”
the better to suit the argument.</note>

the resurrection the condition which it once had. There is therefore by no means the same
good reason why the soul should be called the natural (or animate) body, which the flesh
has for bearing that designation. The flesh, in fact, was a body before it was an animate body.
When the flesh was joined by the soul,7691 it then became the natural (or animate) body.
Now, although the soul is a corporeal substance,7692 yet, as it is not an animated body, but
rather an animating one, it cannot be called the animate (or natural) body, nor can it become
that thing which it produces. It is indeed when the soul accrues to something else that it
makes that thing animate; but unless it so accrues, how will it ever produce animation? As
therefore the flesh was at first an animate (or natural) body on receiving the soul, so at last
will it become a spiritual body when invested with the spirit. Now the apostle, by severally
adducing this order in Adam and in Christ, fairly distinguishes between the two states, in
the very essentials of their difference. And when he calls Christ “the last Adam,”7693 you
may from this circumstance discover how strenuously he labours to establish throughout
his teaching the resurrection of the flesh, not of the soul. Thus, then, the first man Adam
was flesh, not soul, and only afterwards became a living soul; and the last Adam, Christ, was
Adam only because He was man, and only man as being flesh, not as being soul. Accordingly
the apostle goes on to say: “Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is
natural, and afterward that which is spiritual,”7694 as in the case of the two Adams. Now,
do you not suppose that he is distinguishing between the natural body and the spiritual
body in the same flesh, after having already drawn the distinction therein in the two Adams,
that is, in the first man and in the last? For from which substance is it that Christ and Adam
have a parity with each other? No doubt it is from their flesh, although it may be from their
soul also. It is, however, in respect of the flesh that they are both man; for the flesh was man
prior to the soul. It was actually from it that they were able to take rank, so as to be
deemed—one the first, and the other the last man, or Adam. Besides, things which are different
in character are only incapable of being arranged in the same order when their diversity
is one of substance; for when it is a diversity either in respect of place, or of time, or of
condition, they probably do admit of classification together. Here, however, they are called
first and last, from the substance of their (common) flesh, just as afterwards again the first
man (is said to be) of the earth, and the second of heaven;7695 but although He is “of heaven”
in respect of the spirit, He is yet man according to the flesh. Now since it is the flesh, and
not the soul, that makes an order (or classification together) in the two Adams compatible,

<pb n="1314"/>
so that the distinction is drawn between them of “the first man becoming a living soul, and
the last a quickening spirit,”7696 so in like manner this distinction between them has already
suggested the conclusion that the distinction is due to the flesh; so that it is of the flesh that
these words speak: “Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural,
and afterward that which is spiritual.”7697 And thus, too, the same flesh must be understood
in a preceding passage: “That which is sown is the natural body, and that which rises again
is the spiritual body; because that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural:
since the first Adam was made a living soul, the last Adam a quickening spirit.”7698 It is all
about man, and all about the flesh because about man.</p>
<p>What shall we say then? Has not the flesh even now (in this life) the spirit by faith? so
that the question still remains to be asked, how it is that the animate (or natural) body can
be said to be sown? Surely the flesh has received even here the spirit—but only its “earnest;”
7699 whereas of the soul (it has received) not the earnest, but the full possession.
Therefore it has the name of animate (or natural) body, expressly because of the higher
substance of the soul (or anima,) in which it is sown, destined hereafter to become, through
the full possession of the spirit which it shall obtain, the spiritual body, in which it is raised
again. What wonder, then, if it is more commonly called after the substance with which it
is fully furnished, than after that of which it has yet but a sprinkling?</p>

<head>Chapter LIV.—Death Swallowed Up of Life. Meaning of This Phrase in Relation to
the Resurrection of the Body.</head>
<p>Then, again, questions very often are suggested by occasional and isolated terms, just
as much as they are by connected sentences. Thus, because of the apostle’s expression, “that
mortality may be swallowed up of life”7700—in reference to the flesh—they wrest the word
swallowed up into the sense of the actual destruction of the flesh; as if we might not speak
of ourselves as swallowing bile, or swallowing grief, meaning that we conceal and hide it,
and keep it within ourselves. The truth is, when it is written, “This mortal must put on immortality,”
7701 it is explained in what sense it is that “mortality is swallowed up of life”—even
whilst, clothed with immortality, it is hidden and concealed, and contained within it, not
as consumed, and destroyed, and lost. But death, you will say in reply to me, at this rate,
must be safe, even when it has been swallowed up. Well, then, I ask you to distinguish words
which are similar in form according to their proper meanings. Death is one thing, and
mortality is another. It is one thing for death to be swallowed up, and another thing for
mortality to be swallowed up. Death is incapable of immortality, but not so mortality. Besides,
as it is written that “this mortal must put on immortality,”7702 how is this possible when it
is swallowed up of life? But how is it swallowed up of life, (in the sense of destroyed by it)
when it is actually received, and restored, and included in it? For the rest, it is only just and
right that death should be swallowed up in utter destruction, since it does itself devour with
this same intent. Death, says the apostle, has devoured by exercising its strength, and
therefore has been itself devoured in the struggle “swallowed up in victory.”7703 “O death,
where is thy sting? O death, where is thy victory?”7704 Therefore life, too, as the great antagonist
of death, will in the struggle swallow up for salvation what death, in its struggle, had
swallowed up for destruction.</p>

<head>Chapter LV.—The Change of a Thing’s Condition is Not the Destruction of Its
Substance. The Application of This Principle to Our Subject.</head>
<p>Now although, in proving that the flesh shall rise again we ipso facto prove that no
other flesh will partake of that resurrection than that which is in question, yet insulated
questions and their occasions do require even discussions of their own, even if they have
been already sufficiently met. We will therefore give a fuller explanation of the force and
the reason of a change which (is so great, that it) almost suggests the presumption that it is
a different flesh which is to rise again; as if, indeed, so great a change amounted to utter
cessation, and a complete destruction of the former self. A distinction, however, must be
made between a change, however great, and everything which has the character of destruction.
For undergoing change is one thing, but being destroyed is another thing. Now this distinction
would no longer exist, if the flesh were to suffer such a change as amounts to destruction.
Destroyed, however, it must be by the change, unless it shall itself persistently remain
throughout the altered condition which shall be exhibited in the resurrection. For precisely
as it perishes, if it does not rise again, so also does it equally perish even if it does rise again,
on the supposition that it is lost7705 in the change. It will as much fail of a future existence,
as if it did not rise again at all. And how absurd is it to rise again for the purpose of not
having a being, when it had it in its power not to rise again, and so lose its being—because
it had already begun its non-existence! Now, things which are absolutely different, as
mutation and destruction are, will not admit of mixture and confusion; in their operations,
too, they differ. One destroys, the other changes. Therefore, as that which is destroyed is
not changed, so that which is changed is not destroyed. To perish is altogether to cease to
be what a thing once was, whereas to be changed is to exist in another condition. Now, if a
thing exists in another condition, it can still be the same thing itself; for since it does not
perish, it has its existence still. A change, indeed, it has experienced, but not a destruction.
A thing may undergo a complete change, and yet remain still the same thing. In like manner,
a man also may be quite himself in substance even in the present life, and for all that undergo
various changes—in habit, in bodily bulk, in health, in condition, in dignity, and in age—in
taste, business, means, houses, laws and customs—and still lose nothing of his human nature,
nor so to be made another man as to cease to be the same; indeed, I ought hardly to say
another man, but another thing. This form of change even the Holy Scriptures give us instances
of. The hand of Moses is changed, and it becomes like a dead one, bloodless, colourless,
and stiff with cold; but on the recovery of heat, and on the restoration of its natural
colour, it is again the same flesh and blood.7706 Afterwards the face of the same Moses is
<note type="footnote">7705 Subducitur.</note>
<note type="footnote">7706 Ex. iv. 6, 7.</note>

<pb n="1317"/>
though they were none other than his human knees7709 which bent beneath the stoning.
The Lord, again, in the retirement of the mount, had changed His raiment for a robe of
light; but He still retained features which Peter could recognise.7710 In that same scene
Moses also and Elias gave proof that the same condition of bodily existence may continue
even in glory—the one in the likeness of a flesh which he had not yet recovered, the other
in the reality of one which he had not yet put off.7711 It was as full of this splendid example
that Paul said: “Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His
glorious body.”7712 But if you maintain that a transfiguration and a conversion amounts to
the annihilation of any substance, then it follows that “Saul, when changed into another
man,”7713 passed away from his own bodily substance; and that Satan himself, when
“transformed into an angel of light,”7714 loses his own proper character. Such is not my
opinion. So likewise changes, conversions and reformations will necessarily take place to
bring about the resurrection, but the substance of the flesh will still be preserved safe.</p>

<head>Chapter LVI.—The Procedure of the Last Judgment, and Its Awards, Only Possible
on the Identity of the Risen Body with Our Present Flesh.</head>
<p>For how absurd, and in truth how unjust, and in both respects how unworthy of God,
for one substance to do the work, and another to reap the reward: that this flesh of ours
should be torn by martyrdom, and another wear the crown; or, on the other hand, that this
flesh of ours should wallow in uncleanness, and another receive the condemnation! Is it not
better to renounce all faith at once in the hope of the resurrection,7715 than to trifle with
the wisdom and justice of God?7716 Better that Marcion should rise again than Valentinus.
For it cannot be believed that the mind, or the memory, or the conscience of existing man
is abolished by putting on that change of raiment which immortality and incorruption
supplies; for in that case all the gain and fruit of the resurrection, and the permanent effect7717
of God’s judgment both on soul and body,7718 would certainly fall to the ground. If I remember
not that it is I who have served Him, how shall I ascribe glory to God? How sing to Him
“the new song,”7719 if I am ignorant that it is I who owe Him thanks? But why is exception
taken only against the change of the flesh, and not of the soul also, which in all things is
superior to the flesh? How happens it, that the self-same soul which in our present flesh has
gone through all life’s course, which has learnt the knowledge of God, and put on Christ,
and sown the hope of salvation in this flesh, must reap its harvest in another flesh of which
we know nothing? Verily that must be a most highly favoured flesh, which shall have the
enjoyment of life at so gratuitous a rate! But if the soul is not to be changed also, then there
is no resurrection of the soul; nor will it be believed to have itself risen, unless it has risen
some different thing.</p>

<head>Chapter LVII.—Our Bodies, However Mutilated Before or After Death, Shall Recover
Their Perfect Integrity in the Resurrection. Illustration of the Enfranchised Slave.</head>
<p>We now come to the most usual cavil of unbelief. If, they say, it be actually the selfsame
substance which is recalled to life with all its form, and lineaments, and quality, then why
not with all its other characteristics? Then the blind, and the lame, and the palsied, and
whoever else may have passed away with any conspicuous mark, will return again with the
same. What now is the fact, although you in the greatness of your conceit7720 thus disdain
to accept from God so vast a grace? Does it not happen that, when you now admit the salvation
of only the soul, you ascribe it to men at the cost of half their nature? What is the good
of believing in the resurrection, unless your faith embraces the whole of it? If the flesh is to
be repaired after its dissolution, much more will it be restored after some violent injury.
Greater cases prescribe rules for lesser ones. Is not the amputation or the crushing of a limb
the death of that limb? Now, if the death of the whole person is rescinded by its resurrection,
what must we say of the death of a part of him? If we are changed for glory, how much
more for integrity!7721 Any loss sustained by our bodies is an accident to them, but their
entirety is their natural property. In this condition we are born. Even if we become injured
in the womb, this is loss suffered by what is already a human being. Natural condition7722
is prior to injury. As life is bestowed by God, so is it restored by Him. As we are when we
receive it, so are we when we recover it. To nature, not to injury, are we restored; to our
state by birth, not to our condition by accident, do we rise again. If God raises not men entire,
He raises not the dead. For what dead man is entire, although he dies entire? Who is without
hurt, that is without life? What body is uninjured, when it is dead, when it is cold, when it
is ghastly, when it is stiff, when it is a corpse? When is a man more infirm, than when he is
entirely infirm? When more palsied, than when quite motionless? Thus, for a dead man to
be raised again, amounts to nothing short of his being restored to his entire condition,—lest
he, forsooth, be still dead in that part in which he has not risen again. God is quite able to
re-make what He once made. This power and this unstinted grace of His He has already
sufficiently guaranteed in Christ; and has displayed Himself to us (in Him) not only as the
restorer of the flesh, but as the repairer of its breaches. And so the apostle says: “The dead
shall be raised incorruptible” (or unimpaired).7723 But how so, unless they become entire,
who have wasted away either in the loss of their health, or in the long decrepitude of the
grave? For when he propounds the two clauses, that “this corruptible must put on incorrup-
<note type="footnote">7720 Qualiscunque.</note>

<note type="footnote">7722 Genus.</note>
<note type="footnote">7723 1 Cor. xv. 52.</note>

<pb n="1320"/>
tion, and this mortal must put on immortality,”7724 he does not repeat the same statement,
but sets forth a distinction. For, by assigning immortality to the repeating of death, and incorruption
to the repairing of the wasted body, he has fitted one to the raising and the other
to the retrieval of the body. I suppose, moreover, that he promises to the Thessalonians the
integrity of the whole substance of man.7725 So that for the great future there need be no
fear of blemished or defective bodies. Integrity, whether the result of preservation or restoration,
will be able to lose nothing more, after the time that it has given back to it whatever
it had lost. Now, when you contend that the flesh will still have to undergo the same sufferings,
if the same flesh be said to have to rise again, you rashly set up nature against her Lord,
and impiously contrast her law against His grace; as if it were not permitted the Lord God
both to change nature, and to preserve her, without subjection to a law. How is it, then, that
we read, “With men these things are impossible, but with God all things are possible;”7726
and again, “God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise?”7727 Let
me ask you, if you were to manumit your slave (seeing that the same flesh and soul will remain
to him, which once were exposed to the whip, and the fetter, and the stripes), will it
therefore be fit for him to undergo the same old sufferings? I trow not. He is instead
thereof honoured with the grace of the white robe, and the favour of the gold ring, and the
name and tribe as well as table of his patron. Give, then, the same prerogative to God, by
virtue of such a change, of reforming our condition, not our nature, by taking away from
it all sufferings, and surrounding it with safeguards of protection. Thus our flesh shall remain
even after the resurrection—so far indeed susceptible of suffering, as it is the flesh, and the
same flesh too; but at the same time impassible, inasmuch as it has been liberated by the
Lord for the very end and purpose of being no longer capable of enduring suffering.</p>

<head>Chapter LVIII.—From This Perfection of Our Restored Bodies Will Flow the Consciousness
of Undisturbed Joy and Peace.</head>
<p>“Everlasting joy,” says Isaiah, “shall be upon their heads.”7728 Well, there is nothing
eternal until after the resurrection. “And sorrow and sighing,” continues he, “shall flee
away.”7729 The angel echoes the same to John: “And God shall wipe away all tears from
their eyes;”7730 from the same eyes indeed which had formerly wept, and which might weep
again, if the loving-kindness of God did not dry up every fountain of tears. And again: “God
shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death,”7731 and therefore
no more corruption, it being chased away by incorruption, even as death is by immortality.
If sorrow, and mourning, and sighing, and death itself, assail us from the afflictions both of
soul and body, how shall they be removed, except by the cessation of their causes, that is to
say, the afflictions of flesh and soul? where will you find adversities in the presence of God?
where, incursions of an enemy in the bosom of Christ? where, attacks of the devil in the
face of the Holy Spirit?—now that the devil himself and his angels are “cast into the lake of
fire.”7732 Where now is necessity, and what they call fortune or fate? What plague awaits
the redeemed from death, after their eternal pardon? What wrath is there for the reconciled,
after grace? What weakness, after their renewed strength? What risk and danger, after their
salvation? That the raiment and shoes of the children of Israel remained unworn and fresh
for the space of forty years;7733 that in their very persons the exact point7734 of convenience
and propriety checked the rank growth of their nails and hair, so that any excess herein
might not be attributed to indecency; that the fires of Babylon injured not either the mitres
or the trousers of the three brethren, however foreign such dress might be to the Jews;7735
that Jonah was swallowed by the monster of the deep, in whose belly whole ships were devoured,
and after three days was vomited out again safe and sound;7736 that Enoch and
Elias, who even now, without experiencing a resurrection (because they have not even encountered
death), are learning to the full what it is for the flesh to be exempted from all
humiliation, and all loss, and all injury, and all disgrace—translated as they have been from

this world, and from this very cause already candidates for everlasting life;7737—to what
faith do these notable facts bear witness, if not to that which ought to inspire in us the belief
that they are proofs and documents of our own future integrity and perfect resurrection?
For, to borrow the apostle’s phrase, these were “figures of ourselves;”7738 and they are
written that we may believe both that the Lord is more powerful than all natural laws about
the body, and that He shows Himself the preserver of the flesh the more emphatically, in
that He has preserved for it its very clothes and shoes.</p>

<head>Chapter LIX.—Our Flesh in the Resurrection Capable, Without Losing Its Essential
Identity, of Bearing the Changed Conditions of Eternal Life, or of Death Eternal.</head>
<p>But, you object, the world to come bears the character of a different dispensation, even
an eternal one; and therefore, you maintain, that the non-eternal substance of this life is
incapable of possessing a state of such different features. This would be true enough, if man
were made for the future dispensation, and not the dispensation for man. The apostle,
however, in his epistle says, “Whether it be the world, or life, or death, or things present, or
things to come; all are yours:”7739 and he here constitutes us heirs even of the future world.
Isaiah gives you no help when he says, “All flesh is grass;”7740 and in another passage, “All
flesh shall see the salvation of God.”7741 It is the issues of men, not their substances, which
he distinguishes. But who does not hold that the judgment of God consists in the twofold
sentence, of salvation and of punishment? Therefore it is that “all flesh is grass,” which is
destined to the fire; and “all flesh shall see the salvation of God,” which is ordained to
eternal life. For myself, I am quite sure that it is in no other flesh than my own that I have
committed adultery, nor in any other flesh am I striving after continence. If there be any
one who bears about in his person two instruments of lasciviousness, he has it in his power,
to be sure, to mow down7742 “the grass” of the unclean flesh, and to reserve for himself only
that which shall see the salvation of God. But when the same prophet represents to us even
nations sometimes estimated as “the small dust of the balance,”7743 and as “less than nothing,
and vanity,”7744 and sometimes as about to hope and “trust in the name”7745 and arm of
the Lord, are we at all misled respecting the Gentile nations by the diversity of statement?

<head>Chapter LX.—All the Characteristics of Our Bodies—Sex, Various Limbs, Etc.—Will
Be Retained, Whatever Change of Functions These May Have, of Which Point,
However, We are No Judges. Analogy of the Repaired Ship.</head>
<p>But behold how persistently they still accumulate their cavils against the flesh, especially
against its identity, deriving their arguments even from the functions of our limbs; on the
one hand saying that these ought to continue permanently pursuing their labours and enjoyments,
as appendages to the same corporeal frame; and on the other hand contending
that, inasmuch as the functions of the limbs shall one day come to an end, the bodily frame
itself must be destroyed, its permanence without its limbs being deemed to be as inconceivable,
as that of the limbs themselves without their functions! What, they ask, will then be
the use of the cavity of our mouth, and its rows of teeth, and the passage of the throat, and
the branch-way of the stomach, and the gulf of the belly, and the entangled tissue of the
bowels, when there shall no longer be room for eating and drinking? What more will there
be for these members to take in, masticate, swallow, secrete, digest, eject? Of what avail will
be our very hands, and feet, and all our labouring limbs, when even all care about food shall
cease? What purpose can be served by loins, conscious of seminal secretions, and all the
other organs of generation, in the two sexes, and the laboratories of embryos, and the
fountains of the breast, when concubinage, and pregnancy, and infant nurture shall cease?
In short, what will be the use of the entire body, when the entire body shall become useless?
In reply to all this, we have then already settled the principle that the dispensation of the
future state ought not to be compared with that of the present world, and that in the interval
between them a change will take place; and we now add the remark, that these functions of
our bodily limbs will continue to supply the needs of this life up to the moment when life
itself shall pass away from time to eternity, as the natural body gives place to the spiritual,
until “this mortal puts on immorality, and this corruptible puts on incorruption:”7747 so
that when life shall itself become freed from all wants, our limbs shall then be freed also
from their services, and therefore will be no longer wanted. Still, although liberated from
their offices, they will be yet preserved for judgment, “that every one may receive the things
done in his body.”7748 For the judgment-seat of God requires that man be kept entire. Entire,
however, he cannot be without his limbs, of the substance of which, not the functions, he
consists; unless, forsooth, you will be bold enough to maintain that a ship is perfect without
her keel, or her bow, or her stern, and without the solidity of her entire frame. And yet how
often have we seen the same ship, after being shattered with the storm and broken by decay,
with all her timbers repaired and restored, gallantly riding on the wave in all the beauty of
a renewed fabric! Do we then disquiet ourselves with doubt about God’s skill, and will, and

rights? Besides, if a wealthy shipowner, who does not grudge money merely for his amusement
or show, thoroughly repairs his ship, and then chooses that she should make no further
voyages, will you contend that the old form and finish is still not necessary to the vessel, although
she is no longer meant for actual service, when the mere safety of a ship requires
such completeness irrespective of service? The sole question, therefore, which is enough for
us to consider here, is whether the Lord, when He ordains salvation for man, intends it for
his flesh; whether it is His will that the selfsame flesh shall be renewed. If so, it will be improper
for you to rule, from the inutility of its limbs in the future state, that the flesh will
be incapable of renovation. For a thing may be renewed, and yet be useless from having
nothing to do; but it cannot be said to be useless if it has no existence. If, indeed, it has existence,
it will be quite possible for it also not to be useless; it may possibly have something to
do; for in the presence of God there will be no idleness.</p>

<head>Chapter LXI.—The Details of Our Bodily Sex, and of the Functions of Our Various
Members. Apology for the Necessity Which Heresy Imposes of Hunting Up All
Its Unblushing Cavils.</head>
<p>Now you have received your mouth, O man, for the purpose of devouring your food
and imbibing your drink: why not, however, for the higher purpose of uttering speech, so
as to distinguish yourself from all other animals? Why not rather for preaching the gospel
of God, that so you may become even His priest and advocate before men? Adam indeed
gave their several names to the animals, before he plucked the fruit of the tree; before he
ate, he prophesied. Then, again, you received your teeth for the consumption of your meal:
why not rather for wreathing your mouth with suitable defence on every opening thereof,
small or wide? Why not, too, for moderating the impulses of your tongue, and guarding
your articulate speech from failure and violence? Let me tell you, (if you do not know), that
there are toothless persons in the world. Look at them, and ask whether even a cage of teeth
be not an honour to the mouth. There are apertures in the lower regions of man and woman,
by means of which they gratify no doubt their animal passions; but why are they not rather
regarded as outlets for the cleanly discharge of natural fluids? Women, moreover, have
within them receptacles where human seed may collect; but are they not designed for the
secretion of those sanguineous issues, which their tardier and weaker sex is inadequate to
disperse? For even details like these require to be mentioned, seeing that heretics single out
what parts of our bodies may suit them, handle them without delicacy, and, as their whim
suggests, pour torrents of scorn and contempt upon the natural functions of our members,
for the purpose of upsetting the resurrection, and making us blush over their cavils; not reflecting
that before the functions cease, the very causes of them will have passed away. There
will be no more meat, because no more hunger; no more drink, because no more thirst; no
more concubinage, because no more child-bearing; no more eating and drinking, because
no more labour and toil. Death, too, will cease; so there will be no more need of the nutriment
of food for the defence of life, nor will mothers’ limbs any longer have to be laden for the
replenishment of our race. But even in the present life there may be cessations of their office
for our stomachs and our generative organs. For forty days Moses7749 and Elias7750 fasted,
and lived upon God alone. For even so early was the principle consecrated: “Man shall not
live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.”7751 See
here faint outlines of our future strength! We even, as we may be able, excuse our mouths
from food, and withdraw our sexes from union. How many voluntary eunuchs are there!
How many virgins espoused to Christ! How many, both of men and women, whom nature

has made sterile, with a structure which cannot procreate! Now, if even here on earth both
the functions and the pleasures of our members may be suspended, with an intermission
which, like the dispensation itself, can only be a temporary one, and yet man’s safety is
nevertheless unimpaired, how much more, when his salvation is secure, and especially in
an eternal dispensation, shall we not cease to desire those things, for which, even here below,
we are not unaccustomed to check our longings!</p>

<head>Chapter LXII.—Our Destined Likeness to the Angels in the Glorious Life of the Resurrection.</head>
<p>To this discussion, however, our Lord’s declaration puts an effectual end: “They shall
be,” says He, “equal unto the angels.”7752 As by not marrying, because of not dying, so, of
course, by not having to yield to any like necessity of our bodily state; even as the angels,
too, sometimes. were “equal unto” men, by eating and drinking, and submitting their feet
to the washing of the bath—having clothed themselves in human guise, without the loss of
their own intrinsic nature. If therefore angels, when they became as men, submitted in their
own unaltered substance of spirit to be treated as if they were flesh, why shall not men in
like manner, when they become “equal unto the angels,” undergo in their unchanged substance
of flesh the treatment of spiritual beings, no more exposed to the usual solicitations
of the flesh in their angelic garb, than were the angels once to those of the spirit when encompassed
in human form? We shall not therefore cease to continue in the flesh, because
we cease to be importuned by the usual wants of the flesh; just as the angels ceased not
therefore to remain in their spiritual substance, because of the suspension of their spiritual
incidents. Lastly, Christ said not, “They shall be angels,” in order not to repeal their existence
as men; but He said, “They shall be equal unto the angels,”7753 that He might preserve their
humanity unimpaired. When He ascribed an angelic likeness to the flesh,7754 He took not
from it its proper substance.</p>

<head>Chapter LXIII.—Conclusion. The Resurrection of the Flesh in Its Absolute Identity
and Perfection. Belief of This Had Become Weak. Hopes for Its Refreshing Restoration
Under the Influences of the Paraclete.</head>
<p>And so the flesh shall rise again, wholly in every man, in its own identity, in its absolute
integrity. Wherever it may be, it is in safe keeping in God’s presence, through that most
faithful “Mediator between God and man, (the man) Jesus Christ,”7755 who shall reconcile
both God to man, and man to God; the spirit to the flesh, and the flesh to the spirit. Both
natures has He already united in His own self; He has fitted them together as bride and
bridegroom in the reciprocal bond of wedded life. Now, if any should insist on making the
soul the bride, then the flesh will follow the soul as her dowry. The soul shall never be an
outcast, to be had home by the bridegroom bare and naked. She has her dower, her outfit,
her fortune in the flesh, which shall accompany her with the love and fidelity of a foster-
sister. But suppose the flesh to be the bride, then in Christ Jesus she has in the contract of
His blood received His Spirit as her spouse. Now, what you take to be her extinction, you
may be sure is only her temporary retirement. It is not the soul only which withdraws from
view. The flesh, too, has her departures for a while—in waters, in fires, in birds, in beasts;
she may seem to be dissolved into these, but she is only poured into them, as into vessels.
And should the vessels themselves afterwards fail to hold her, escaping from even these,
and returning to her mother earth, she is absorbed once more, as it were, by its secret embraces,
ultimately to stand forth to view, like Adam when summoned to hear from his Lord
and Creator the words, “Behold, the man is become as one of us!”7756—thoroughly
“knowing” by that time “the evil” which she had escaped, “and the good” which she has acquired.
Why, then, O soul, should you envy the flesh? There is none, after the Lord, whom
you should love so dearly; none more like a brother to you, which is even born along with
yourself in God. You ought rather to have been by your prayers obtaining resurrection for
her: her sins, whatever they were, were owing to you. However, it is no wonder if you hate
her; for you have repudiated her Creator.7757 You have accustomed yourself either to deny
or change her existence even in Christ7758—corrupting the very Word of God Himself, who
became flesh, either by mutilating or misinterpreting the Scripture,7759 and introducing,

above all, apocryphal mysteries and blasphemous fables.7760 But yet Almighty God, in His
most gracious providence, by “pouring out of His Spirit in these last days, upon all flesh,
upon His servants and on His handmaidens,”7761 has checked these impostures of unbelief
and perverseness, reanimated men’s faltering faith in the resurrection of the flesh, and
cleared from all obscurity and equivocation the ancient Scriptures (of both God’s Testaments7762)
by the clear light of their (sacred) words and meanings. Now, since it was
“needful that there should be heresies, in order that they which are approved might be made
manifest;”7763 since, however, these heresies would be unable to put on a bold front without
some countenance from the Scriptures, it therefore is plain enough that the ancient Holy
Writ has furnished them with sundry materials for their evil doctrine, which very materials
indeed (so distorted) are refutable from the same Scriptures. It was fit and proper, therefore,
that the Holy Ghost should no longer withhold the effusions of His gracious light upon
these inspired writings, in order that they might be able to disseminate the seeds of truth
with no admixture of heretical subtleties, and pluck out from it their tares. He has accordingly
now dispersed all the perplexities of the past, and their self-chosen allegories and parables,
by the open and perspicuous explanation of the entire mystery, through the new prophecy,
which descends in copious streams from the Paraclete. If you will only draw water from His
fountains, you will never thirst for other doctrine: no feverish craving after subtle questions
will again consume you; but by drinking in evermore the resurrection of the flesh, you will
be satisfied with the refreshing draughts.</p>

 <p>I.
(Cadaver, cap. xviii. p. 588.)</p>
<p>The Schoolmen and middle-age jurists improved on Tertullian’s etymology. He says,—“a
cadendo—cadaver.” But they form the word thus: Caro data vermibus = Ca-da-ver.</p>
<p>On this subject see a most interesting discourse of the (paradoxical and sophistical, nay
the whimsical) Count Joseph de Maistre, in his Soirées de St. Pétersbourg.7764 He remarks
on the happy formation of many Latin words, in this manner: e.g., Cæcus ut ire = Cæcutire,
“to grope like a blind man.” The French, he says, are not without such examples, and he
instances the word ancêtre = ancestor, as composed out of ancien and être, i.e., one of a
former existence. Courage, he says, is formed from cæur and rage, this use of rage being the
Greek θυμος. He supposes that the English use the word rage in this sense, but I recall only
the instance:
<lg>
<l>“Chill penury repressed their noble rage,”</l>
</lg> 
from Gray’s Elegy. The Diversions of Purley, of Horne-Tooke, supply amusing examples
of the like in the formation of English words.</p>

 <p>II.
(His flesh, the Bread, cap. xxxvii. p. 572.)</p>
<p>)Note our author’s exposition. He censures those who understood our Lord’s words after
the letter, as if they were to eat the carnal body. He expounds the spiritual thing which gives
life as to be understood by the text: “the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and
they are life.” His word is the life-giving principle and therefore he called his flesh by the
same name: and we are to “devour Him with the ear and to ruminate on Him with the understanding,
and to digest Him by faith.” The flesh profits nothing, the spirit imparts life.
Now, was Tertullian ever censured for this exposition? On the contrary, this was the faith
of the Catholic Church, from the beginning. Our Saxon forefathers taught the same, as appears
from the Homily of Ælfric,7765 a.d. 980, and from the exposition of Ratramn, a.d. 840.
The heresy of Transubstantiation was not dogmatic even among Latins, until the Thirteenth

<pb n="1333"/>
century, and it prevailed in England less than three hundred years, when the Catholic doctrine
was restored, through the influence of Ratramn’s treatise first upon the mind of Ridley and
then by Ridley’s arguments with Cranmer. Thus were their understandings opened to the
Scriptures and to the acknowledging of the Truth, for which they suffered martyrdom. To
the reformation we owe the rescue of Ante-Nicene doctrine from the perversions of the
Schoolmen and the gradual corruptions of doctrine after the Ninth Century.</p>

 <p>III.
(Paradise, cap. xliii. p. 576.)</p>
<p>This sentence reads, in the translation I am editing, as follows: “No one, on becoming
absent from the body, is at once a dweller in the presence of the Lord, except by the
prerogative of martyrdom, whereby (the saint) gets at once a lodging in Paradise, not in
Hades.” But the original does not say precisely this, nor does the author use the Greek word
Hades. His words are: “Nemo enim peregrinatus a corpore statim immoratur penes
Dominum nisi ex martyrii proerogativa Paradiso silicet non Inferis diversurus.” The passage
therefore, is not necessarily as inconsistent with the author’s topography of the invisible
world, as might seem. “Not in the regions beneath Paradise but in Paradise itself,” seems to
be the idea; Paradise being included in the world of Hades, indeed, but in a lofty region, far
enough removed from the Inferi, and refreshed by light from the third Heaven and the
throne itself, (as this planet is by the light of the Sun,) immensely distant though it be from
the final abode of the Redeemed.</p>

<p>In various ways has the devil rivalled and resisted the truth. Sometimes his aim has
been to destroy the truth by defending it. He maintains that there is one only Lord, the
Almighty Creator of the world, in order that out of this doctrine of the unity he may fabricate
a heresy. He says that the Father Himself came down into the Virgin, was Himself born of
her, Himself suffered, indeed was Himself Jesus Christ. Here the old serpent has fallen out
with himself, since, when he tempted Christ after John’s baptism, he approached Him as
“the Son of God;” surely intimating that God had a Son, even on the testimony of the very
Scriptures, out of which he was at the moment forging his temptation: “If thou be the Son
of God, command that these stones be made bread.”7768 Again: “If thou be the Son of God,
cast thyself down from hence;7769 for it is written, He shall give His angels charge concerning
thee”—referring no doubt, to the Father—“and in their hands they shall bear thee up, that
thou hurt not thy foot against a stone.”7770 Or perhaps, after all, he was only reproaching
the Gospels with a lie, saying in fact: “Away with Matthew; away with Luke! Why heed their
words? In spite of them, I declare that it was God Himself that I approached; it was the
<note type="footnote">7766 The error of Praxeas appears to have originated in anxiety to maintain the unity of God; which, he
thought, could only be done by saying that the Father, Son and Holy Ghost were one and the same. He contended,
therefore, according to Tertullian, that the Father himself descended into the virgin, was born of her, suffered,
and was in a word Jesus Christ. From the most startling of the deductions from Praxeas’ general theory, his opponents
gave him and his followers the name of Patripassians; from another point in his teaching they were

Almighty Himself that I tempted face to face; and it was for no other purpose than to tempt
Him that I approached Him. If, on the contrary, it had been only the Son of God, most likely
I should never have condescended to deal with Him.” However, he is himself a liar from
the beginning,7771 and whatever man he instigates in his own way; as, for instance, Praxeas.
For he was the first to import into Rome from Asia this kind of heretical pravity, a man in
other respects of restless disposition, and above all inflated with the pride of confessorship
simply and solely because he had to bear for a short time the annoyance of a prison; on
which occasion, even “if he had given his body to be burned, it would have profited him
nothing,” not having the love of God,7772 whose very gifts he has resisted and destroyed.
For after the Bishop of Rome7773 had acknowledged the prophetic gifts of Montanus, Prisca,
and Maximilla, and, in consequence of the acknowledgment, had bestowed his peace7774
on the churches of Asia and Phrygia, he, by importunately urging false accusations against
the prophets themselves and their churches, and insisting on the authority of the bishop’s
predecessors in the see, compelled him to recall the pacific letter which he had issued, as
well as to desist from his purpose of acknowledging the said gifts. By this Praxeas did a
twofold service for the devil at Rome: he drove away prophecy, and he brought in heresy;
he put to flight the Paraclete, and he crucified the Father. Praxeas’ tares had been moreover
sown, and had produced their fruit here also,7775 while many were asleep in their simplicity
of doctrine; but these tares actually seemed to have been plucked up, having been discovered
and exposed by him whose agency God was pleased to employ. Indeed, Praxeas had deliberately
resumed his old (true) faith, teaching it after his renunciation of error; and there is
his own handwriting in evidence remaining among the carnally-minded,7776 in whose society
the transaction then took place; afterwards nothing was heard of him. We indeed, on our
part, subsequently withdrew from the carnally-minded on our acknowledgment and
maintenance of the Paraclete.7777 But the tares of Praxeas had then everywhere shaken out

<p>In the course of time, then, the Father forsooth was born, and the Father suffered, God
Himself, the Lord Almighty, whom in their preaching they declare to be Jesus Christ. We,
however, as we indeed always have done (and more especially since we have been better
instructed by the Paraclete, who leads men indeed into all truth), believe that there is one
only God, but under the following dispensation, or οἰκονομία , as it is called, that this one
only God has also a Son, His Word, who proceeded7779 from Himself, by whom all things
were made, and without whom nothing was made. Him we believe to have been sent by the
Father into the Virgin, and to have been born of her—being both Man and God, the Son of
Man and the Son of God, and to have been called by the name of Jesus Christ; we believe
Him to have suffered, died, and been buried, according to the Scriptures, and, after He had
been raised again by the Father and taken back to heaven, to be sitting at the right hand of
the Father, and that He will come to judge the quick and the dead; who sent also from
heaven from the Father, according to His own promise, the Holy Ghost, the Paraclete,7780
the sanctifier of the faith of those who believe in the Father, and in the Son, and in the Holy
Ghost. That this rule of faith has come down to us from the beginning of the gospel, even
before any of the older heretics, much more before Praxeas, a pretender of yesterday, will
be apparent both from the lateness of date7781 which marks all heresies, and also from the
absolutely novel character of our new-fangled Praxeas. In this principle also we must
henceforth find a presumption of equal force against all heresies whatsoever—that whatever
is first is true, whereas that is spurious which is later in date.7782 But keeping this prescriptive
rule inviolate, still some opportunity must be given for reviewing (the statements of heretics),

<head>Chapter III.—Sundry Popular Fears and Prejudices. The Doctrine of the Trinity in
Unity Rescued from These Misapprehensions.</head>
<p>The simple, indeed, (I will not call them unwise and unlearned,) who always constitute
the majority of believers, are startled at the dispensation7790 (of the Three in One), on the
ground that their very rule of faith withdraws them from the world’s plurality of gods to
the one only true God; not understanding that, although He is the one only God, He must
yet be believed in with His own οἰκονομία . The numerical order and distribution of the
Trinity they assume to be a division of the Unity; whereas the Unity which derives the
Trinity out of its own self is so far from being destroyed, that it is actually supported by it.
They are constantly throwing out against us that we are preachers of two gods and three
gods, while they take to themselves pre-eminently the credit of being worshippers of the
One God; just as if the Unity itself with irrational deductions did not produce heresy, and
the Trinity rationally considered constitute the truth. We, say they, maintain the Monarchy
(or, sole government of God).7791 And so, as far as the sound goes, do even Latins (and ignorant
ones too) pronounce the word in such a way that you would suppose their understanding
of the μοναρχία (or Monarchy) was as complete as their pronunciation of the term.
Well, then Latins take pains to pronounce the μοναρχία (or Monarchy), while Greeks actually
refuse to understand the οἰκονομία, or Dispensation (of the Three in One). As for myself,
however, if I have gleaned any knowledge of either language, I am sure that μοναρχία (or
Monarchy) has no other meaning than single and individual7792 rule; but for all that, this
monarchy does not, because it is the government of one, preclude him whose government
it is, either from having a son, or from having made himself actually a son to himself,7793
or from ministering his own monarchy by whatever agents he will. Nay more, I contend
that no dominion so belongs to one only, as his own, or is in such a sense singular, or is in
such a sense a monarchy, as not also to be administered through other persons most closely
connected with it, and whom it has itself provided as officials to itself. If, moreover, there
be a son belonging to him whose monarchy it is, it does not forthwith become divided and
cease to be a monarchy, if the son also be taken as a sharer in it; but it is as to its origin
equally his, by whom it is communicated to the son; and being his, it is quite as much a
monarchy (or sole empire), since it is held together by two who are so inseparable.7794
Therefore, inasmuch as the Divine Monarchy also is administered by so many legions and

hosts of angels, according as it is written, “Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and
ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him;”7795 and since it has not from this circumstance
ceased to be the rule of one (so as no longer to be a monarchy), because it is administered
by so many thousands of powers; how comes it to pass that God should be
thought to suffer division and severance in the Son and in the Holy Ghost, who have the
second and the third places assigned to them, and who are so closely joined with the Father
in His substance, when He suffers no such (division and severance) in the multitude of so
many angels? Do you really suppose that Those, who are naturally members of the Father’s
own substance, pledges of His love,7796 instruments of His might, nay, His power itself and
the entire system of His monarchy, are the overthrow and destruction thereof? You are not
right in so thinking. I prefer your exercising yourself on the meaning of the thing rather
than on the sound of the word. Now you must understand the overthrow of a monarchy to
be this, when another dominion, which has a framework and a state peculiar to itself (and
is therefore a rival), is brought in over and above it: when, e.g., some other god is introduced
in opposition to the Creator, as in the opinions of Marcion; or when many gods are introduced,
according to your Valentinuses and your Prodicuses. Then it amounts to an overthrow
of the Monarchy, since it involves the destruction of the Creator.7797</p>

<p>But as for me, who derive the Son from no other source but from the substance of the
Father, and (represent Him) as doing nothing without the Father’s will, and as having received
all power from the Father, how can I be possibly destroying the Monarchy from the faith,
when I preserve it in the Son just as it was committed to Him by the Father? The same remark
(I wish also to be formally) made by me with respect to the third degree in the Godhead,
because I believe the Spirit to proceed from no other source than from the Father through
the Son.7798 Look to it then, that it be not you rather who are destroying the Monarchy,
when you overthrow the arrangement and dispensation of it, which has been constituted
in just as many names as it has pleased God to employ. But it remains so firm and stable in
its own state, notwithstanding the introduction into it of the Trinity, that the Son actually
has to restore it entire to the Father; even as the apostle says in his epistle, concerning the
very end of all: “When He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; for
He must reign till He hath put all enemies under His feet;”7799 following of course the words
of the Psalm: “Sit Thou on my right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.”7800
“When, however, all things shall be subdued to Him, (with the exception of Him who did
put all things under Him,) then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him who put all
things under Him, that God may be all in all.”7801 We thus see that the Son is no obstacle
to the Monarchy, although it is now administered by7802 the Son; because with the Son it
is still in its own state, and with its own state will be restored to the Father by the Son. No
one, therefore, will impair it, on account of admitting the Son (to it), since it is certain that
it has been committed to Him by the Father, and by and by has to be again delivered up by
Him to the Father. Now, from this one passage of the epistle of the inspired apostle, we have
been already able to show that the Father and the Son are two separate Persons, not only by
the mention of their separate names as Father and the Son, but also by the fact that He who
delivered up the kingdom, and He to whom it is delivered up—and in like manner, He who
subjected (all things), and He to whom they were subjected—must necessarily be two different
Beings.</p>

Procession. Illustrated by the Operation of the Human Thought and Consciousness.</head>
<p>But since they will have the Two to be but One, so that the Father shall be deemed to
be the same as the Son, it is only right that the whole question respecting the Son should be
examined, as to whether He exists, and who He is and the mode of His existence. Thus shall
the truth itself7803 secure its own sanction7804 from the Scriptures, and the interpretations
which guard7805 them. There are some who allege that even Genesis opens thus in Hebrew:
“In the beginning God made for Himself a Son.”7806 As there is no ground for this, I am
led to other arguments derived from God’s own dispensation,7807 in which He existed before
the creation of the world, up to the generation of the Son. For before all things God was
alone—being in Himself and for Himself universe, and space, and all things. Moreover, He
was alone, because there was nothing external to Him but Himself. Yet even not then was
He alone; for He had with Him that which He possessed in Himself, that is to say, His own
Reason. For God is rational, and Reason was first in Him; and so all things were from
Himself. This Reason is His own Thought (or Consciousness)7808 which the Greeks call
λόγος, by which term we also designate Word or Discourse7809 and therefore it is now usual
with our people, owing to the mere simple interpretation of the term, to say that the Word7810
was in the beginning with God; although it would be more suitable to regard Reason as the
more ancient; because God had not Word7811 from the beginning, but He had Reason7812
even before the beginning; because also Word itself consists of Reason, which it thus proves
to have been the prior existence as being its own substance.7813 Not that this distinction is

of any practical moment. For although God had not yet sent out His Word,7814 He still had
Him within Himself, both in company with and included within His very Reason, as He silently
planned and arranged within Himself everything which He was afterwards about to
utter7815 through His Word. Now, whilst He was thus planning and arranging with His
own Reason, He was actually causing that to become Word which He was dealing with in
the way of Word or Discourse.7816 And that you may the more readily understand this,
consider first of all, from your own self, who are made “in the image and likeness of God,”7817
for what purpose it is that you also possess reason in yourself, who are a rational creature,
as being not only made by a rational Artificer, but actually animated out of His substance.
Observe, then, that when you are silently conversing with yourself, this very process is carried
on within you by your reason, which meets you with a word at every movement of your
thought, at every impulse of your conception. Whatever you think, there is a word; whatever
you conceive, there is reason. You must needs speak it in your mind; and while you are
speaking, you admit speech as an interlocutor with you, involved in which there is this very
reason, whereby, while in thought you are holding converse with your word, you are (by
reciprocal action) producing thought by means of that converse with your word. Thus, in
a certain sense, the word is a second person within you, through which in thinking you utter
speech, and through which also, (by reciprocity of process,) in uttering speech you generate
thought. The word is itself a different thing from yourself. Now how much more fully is all
this transacted in God, whose image and likeness even you are regarded as being, inasmuch
as He has reason within Himself even while He is silent, and involved in that Reason His
Word! I may therefore without rashness first lay this down (as a fixed principle) that even
then before the creation of the universe God was not alone, since He had within Himself
both Reason, and, inherent in Reason, His Word, which He made second to Himself by
agitating it within Himself.</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—The Word of God is Also the Wisdom of God. The Going Forth of
Wisdom to Create the Universe, According to the Divine Plan.</head>
<p>This power and disposition7818 of the Divine Intelligence7819 is set forth also in the
Scriptures under the name of Σοφία, Wisdom; for what can be better entitled to the name
of Wisdom7820 than the Reason or the Word of God? Listen therefore to Wisdom herself,
constituted in the character of a Second Person: “At the first the Lord created me as the beginning
of His ways, with a view to His own works, before He made the earth, before the
mountains were settled; moreover, before all the hills did He beget me;”7821 that is to say,
He created and generated me in His own intelligence. Then, again, observe the distinction
between them implied in the companionship of Wisdom with the Lord. “When He prepared
the heaven,” says Wisdom, “I was present with Him; and when He made His strong places
upon the winds, which are the clouds above; and when He secured the fountains, (and all
things) which are beneath the sky, I was by, arranging all things with Him; I was by, in whom
He delighted; and daily, too, did I rejoice in His presence.”7822 Now, as soon as it pleased
God to put forth into their respective substances and forms the things which He had planned
and ordered within Himself, in conjunction with His Wisdom’s Reason and Word, He first
put forth the Word Himself, having within Him His own inseparable Reason and Wisdom,
in order that all things might be made through Him through whom they had been planned
and disposed, yea, and already made, so far forth as (they were) in the mind and intelligence
of God. This, however, was still wanting to them, that they should also be openly known,
and kept permanently in their proper forms and substances.</p>

<p>Then, therefore, does the Word also Himself assume His own form and glorious garb,7823
His own sound and vocal utterance, when God says, “Let there be light.”7824 This is the
perfect nativity of the Word, when He proceeds forth from God—formed7825 by Him first
to devise and think out all things under the name of Wisdom—“The Lord created or
formed7826 me as the beginning of His ways;”7827 then afterward begotten, to carry all into
effect—“When He prepared the heaven, I was present with Him.”7828 Thus does He make
Him equal to Him: for by proceeding from Himself He became His first-begotten Son, because
begotten before all things;7829 and His only-begotten also, because alone begotten of
God, in a way peculiar to Himself, from the womb of His own heart—even as the Father
Himself testifies: “My heart,” says He, “hath emitted my most excellent Word.”7830 The
Father took pleasure evermore in Him, who equally rejoiced with a reciprocal gladness in
the Father’s presence: “Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten Thee;”7831 even before the
morning star did I beget Thee. The Son likewise acknowledges the Father, speaking in His
own person, under the name of Wisdom: “The Lord formed Me as the beginning of His
ways, with a view to His own works; before all the hills did He beget Me.”7832 For if indeed
Wisdom in this passage seems to say that She was created by the Lord with a view to His
works, and to accomplish His ways, yet proof is given in another Scripture that “all things
were made by the Word, and without Him was there nothing made;”7833 as, again, in another
place (it is said), “By His word were the heavens established, and all the powers thereof by
His Spirit”7834—that is to say, by the Spirit (or Divine Nature) which was in the Word: thus

is it evident that it is one and the same power which is in one place described under the
name of Wisdom, and in another passage under the appellation of the Word, which was
initiated for the works of God7835 which “strengthened the heavens;”7836 “by which all
things were made,”7837 “and without which nothing was made.”7838 Nor need we dwell any
longer on this point, as if it were not the very Word Himself, who is spoken of under the
name both of Wisdom and of Reason, and of the entire Divine Soul and Spirit. He became
also the Son of God, and was begotten when He proceeded forth from Him. Do you then,
(you ask,) grant that the Word is a certain substance, constructed by the Spirit and the
communication of Wisdom? Certainly I do. But you will not allow Him to be really a substantive
being, by having a substance of His own; in such a way that He may be regarded as
an objective thing and a person, and so be able (as being constituted second to God the
Father,) to make two, the Father and the Son, God and the Word. For you will say, what is
a word, but a voice and sound of the mouth, and (as the grammarians teach) air when struck
against,7839 intelligible to the ear, but for the rest a sort of void, empty, and incorporeal
thing. I, on the contrary, contend that nothing empty and void could have come forth from
God, seeing that it is not put forth from that which is empty and void; nor could that possibly
be devoid of substance which has proceeded from so great a substance, and has produced
such mighty substances: for all things which were made through Him, He Himself (personally)
made. How could it be, that He Himself is nothing, without whom nothing was made?
How could He who is empty have made things which are solid, and He who is void have
made things which are full, and He who is incorporeal have made things which have body?
For although a thing may sometimes be made different from him by whom it is made, yet
nothing can be made by that which is a void and empty thing. Is that Word of God, then, a
void and empty thing, which is called the Son, who Himself is designated God? “The Word
was with God, and the Word was God.”7840 It is written, “Thou shalt not take God’s name
in vain.”7841 This for certain is He “who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery
to be equal with God.”7842 In what form of God? Of course he means in some form, not in
none. For who will deny that God is a body, although “God is a Spirit?”7843 For Spirit has

whatsoever they be, have both their substance and their form in God, whereby they are

not be without substance! Whatever, therefore, was the substance of the Word that I designate

Not, Like the Emanations of Valentinus, Separable from the Father. Nor is the
Holy Ghost Separable from Either. Illustrations from Nature.</head>
<p>If any man from this shall think that I am introducing some προβολή—that is to say,
some prolation7846 of one thing out of another, as Valentinus does when he sets forth Æon
from Æon, one after another—then this is my first reply to you: Truth must not therefore
refrain from the use of such a term, and its reality and meaning, because heresy also employs
it. The fact is, heresy has rather taken it from Truth, in order to mould it into its own coun
terfeit. Was the Word of God put forth or not? Here take your stand with me, and flinch
not. If He was put forth, then acknowledge that the true doctrine has a prolation;7847 and
never mind heresy, when in any point it mimics the truth. The question now is, in what
sense each side uses a given thing and the word which expresses it. Valentinus divides and
separates his prolations from their Author, and places them at so great a distance from Him,
that the Æon does not know the Father: he longs, indeed, to know Him, but cannot; nay,
he is almost swallowed up and dissolved into the rest of matter.7848 With us, however, the
Son alone knows the Father,7849 and has Himself unfolded “the Father’s bosom.”7850 He
has also heard and seen all things with the Father; and what He has been commanded by
the Father, that also does He speak.7851 And it is not His own will, but the Father’s, which
He has accomplished,7852 which He had known most intimately, even from the beginning.
“For what man knoweth the things which be in God, but the Spirit which is in Him?”7853
But the Word was formed by the Spirit, and (if I may so express myself) the Spirit is the
body of the Word. The Word, therefore, is both always in the Father, as He says, “I am in
the Father;”7854 and is always with God, according to what is written, “And the Word was

the Father are one.”7856 This will be the prolation, taught by the truth,7857 the guardian of
the Unity, wherein we declare that the Son is a prolation from the Father, without being
separated from Him. For God sent forth the Word, as the Paraclete also declares, just as
the root puts forth the tree, and the fountain the river, and the sun the ray.7858 For these
are προβολαί, or emanations, of the substances from which they proceed. I should not hesitate,
indeed, to call the tree the son or offspring of the root, and the river of the fountain,
and the ray of the sun; because every original source is a parent, and everything which issues
from the origin is an offspring. Much more is (this true of) the Word of God, who has actually
received as His own peculiar designation the name of Son. But still the tree is not
severed from the root, nor the river from the fountain, nor the ray from the sun; nor, indeed,
is the Word separated from God. Following, therefore, the form of these analogies, I confess
that I call God and His Word—the Father and His Son—two. For the root and the tree are
distinctly two things, but correlatively joined; the fountain and the river are also two forms,
but indivisible; so likewise the sun and the ray are two forms, but coherent ones. Everything
which proceeds from something else must needs be second to that from which it proceeds,
without being on that account separated. Where, however, there is a second, there must be
two; and where there is a third, there must be three. Now the Spirit indeed is third from
God and the Son; just as the fruit of the tree is third from the root, or as the stream out of
the river is third from the fountain, or as the apex of the ray is third from the sun. Nothing,
however, is alien from that original source whence it derives its own properties. In like
manner the Trinity, flowing down from the Father through intertwined and connected
steps, does not at all disturb the Monarchy,7859 whilst it at the same time guards the state
of the Economy.7860</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—The Catholic Rule of Faith Expounded in Some of Its Points. Especially
in the Unconfused Distinction of the Several Persons of the Blessed Trinity.</head>
<p>Bear always in mind that this is the rule of faith which I profess; by it I testify that the
Father, and the Son, and the Spirit are inseparable from each other, and so will you know
in what sense this is said. Now, observe, my assertion is that the Father is one, and the Son
one, and the Spirit one, and that They are distinct from Each Other. This statement is taken
in a wrong sense by every uneducated as well as every perversely disposed person, as if it
predicated a diversity, in such a sense as to imply a separation among the Father, and the
Son, and the Spirit. I am, moreover, obliged to say this, when (extolling the Monarchy at
the expense of the Economy) they contend for the identity of the Father and Son and Spirit,
that it is not by way of diversity that the Son differs from the Father, but by distribution: it
is not by division that He is different, but by distinction; because the Father is not the same
as the Son, since they differ one from the other in the mode of their being.7861 For the
Father is the entire substance, but the Son is a derivation and portion of the whole,7862 as
He Himself acknowledges: “My Father is greater than I.”7863 In the Psalm His inferiority is
described as being “a little lower than the angels.”7864 Thus the Father is distinct from the
Son, being greater than the Son, inasmuch as He who begets is one, and He who is begotten
is another; He, too, who sends is one, and He who is sent is another; and He, again, who
makes is one, and He through whom the thing is made is another. Happily the Lord Himself
employs this expression of the person of the Paraclete, so as to signify not a division or
severance, but a disposition (of mutual relations in the Godhead); for He says, “I will pray
the Father, and He shall send you another Comforter…even the Spirit of truth,”7865 thus
making the Paraclete distinct from Himself, even as we say that the Son is also distinct from
the Father; so that He showed a third degree in the Paraclete, as we believe the second degree
is in the Son, by reason of the order observed in the Economy. Besides, does not the very

uses expressions which in aftertimes, when controversy had introduced greater precision of language, were
studiously avoided by the orthodox. Thus he calls the Father the whole substance, the Son a derivation from or
portion of the whole.” (Bp. Kaye, On Tertullian, p. 505). After Arius, the language of theology received greater
precision; but as it is, there is no doubt of the orthodoxy of Tertullian’s doctrine, since he so firmly and ably
teaches the Son’s consubstantiality with the Father—equal to Him and inseparable from him. [In other words,
Tertullian could not employ a technical phraseology afterwards adopted to give precision to the same orthodox
ideas.]</note>

fact that they have the distinct names of Father and Son amount to a declaration that they
are distinct in personality?7866 For, of course, all things will be what their names represent
them to be; and what they are and ever will be, that will they be called; and the distinction
indicated by the names does not at all admit of any confusion, because there is none in the
things which they designate. “Yes is yes, and no is no; for what is more than these, cometh
of evil.”7867</p>

<head>Chapter X.—The Very Names of Father and Son Prove the Personal Distinction of
the Two. They Cannot Possibly Be Identical, Nor is Their Identity Necessary to
Preserve the Divine Monarchy.</head>
<p>So it is either the Father or the Son, and the day is not the same as the night; nor is the
Father the same as the Son, in such a way that Both of them should be One, and One or the
Other should be Both,—an opinion which the most conceited “Monarchians” maintain. He
Himself, they say, made Himself a Son to Himself.7868 Now a Father makes a Son, and a
Son makes a Father;7869 and they who thus become reciprocally related out of each other
to each other cannot in any way by themselves simply become so related to themselves, that
the Father can make Himself a Son to Himself, and the Son render Himself a Father to
Himself. And the relations which God establishes, them does He also guard. A father must
needs have a son, in order to be a father; so likewise a son, to be a son, must have a father.
It is, however, one thing to have, and another thing to be. For instance, in order to be a
husband, I must have a wife; I can never myself be my own wife. In like manner, in order
to be a father, I have a son, for I never can be a son to myself; and in order to be a son, I
have a father, it being impossible for me ever to be my own father. And it is these relations
which make me (what I am), when I come to possess them: I shall then be a father, when I
have a son; and a son, when I have a father. Now, if I am to be to myself any one of these
relations, I no longer have what I am myself to be: neither a father, because I am to be my
own father; nor a son, because I shall be my own son. Moreover, inasmuch as I ought to
have one of these relations in order to be the other; so, if I am to be both together, I shall
fail to be one while I possess not the other. For if I must be myself my son, who am also a
father, I now cease to have a son, since I am my own son. But by reason of not having a son,
since I am my own son, how can I be a father? For I ought to have a son, in order to be a
father. Therefore I am not a son, because I have not a father, who makes a son. In like
manner, if I am myself my father, who am also a son, I no longer have a father, but am myself
my father. By not having a father, however, since I am my own father, how can I be a son?
For I ought to have a father, in order to be a son. I cannot therefore be a father, because I
have not a son, who makes a father. Now all this must be the device of the devil—this excluding
and severing one from the other—since by including both together in one under pretence
of the Monarchy, he causes neither to be held and acknowledged, so that He is not the
Father, since indeed He has not the Son; neither is He the Son, since in like manner He has
not the Father: for while He is the Father, He will not be the Son. In this way they hold the
Monarchy, but they hold neither the Father nor the Son. Well, but “with God nothing is

impossible.”7870 True enough; who can be ignorant of it? Who also can be unaware that “the
things which are impossible with men are possible with God?”7871 “The foolish things also
of the world hath God chosen to confound the things which are wise.”7872 We have read it
all. Therefore, they argue, it was not difficult for God to make Himself both a Father and a
Son, contrary to the condition of things among men. For a barren woman to have a child
against nature was no difficulty with God; nor was it for a virgin to conceive. Of course
nothing is “too hard for the Lord.”7873 But if we choose to apply this principle so extravagantly
and harshly in our capricious imaginations, we may then make out God to have done
anything we please, on the ground that it was not impossible for Him to do it. We must not,
however, because He is able to do all things suppose that He has actually done what He has
not done. But we must inquire whether He has really done it. God could, if He had liked,
have furnished man with wings to fly with, just as He gave wings to kites. We must not,
however, run to the conclusion that He did this because He was able to do it. He might also
have extinguished Praxeas and all other heretics at once; it does not follow, however, that
He did, simply because He was able. For it was necessary that there should be both kites
and heretics; it was necessary also that the Father should be crucified.7874 In one sense there
will be something difficult even for God—namely, that which He has not done—not because
He could not, but because He would not, do it. For with God, to be willing is to be able,
and to be unwilling is to be unable; all that He has willed, however, He has both been able
to accomplish, and has displayed His ability. Since, therefore, if God had wished to make
Himself a Son to Himself, He had it in His power to do so; and since, if He had it in His
power, He effected His purpose, you will then make good your proof of His power and His
will (to do even this) when you shall have proved to us that He actually did it.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—The Identity of the Father and the Son, as Praxeas Held It, Shown to
Be Full of Perplexity and Absurdity. Many Scriptures Quoted in Proof of the
Distinction of the Divine Persons of the Trinity.</head>
<p>It will be your duty, however, to adduce your proofs out of the Scriptures as plainly as
we do, when we prove that He made His Word a Son to Himself. For if He calls Him Son,
and if the Son is none other than He who has proceeded from the Father Himself, and if the
Word has proceeded from the Father Himself, He will then be the Son, and not Himself
from whom He proceeded. For the Father Himself did not proceed from Himself. Now, you
who say that the Father is the same as the Son, do really make the same Person both to have
sent forth from Himself (and at the same time to have gone out from Himself as) that Being
which is God. If it was possible for Him to have done this, He at all events did not do it. You
must bring forth the proof which I require of you—one like my own; that is, (you must
prove to me) that the Scriptures show the Son and the Father to be the same, just as on our
side the Father and the Son are demonstrated to be distinct; I say distinct, but not separate:7875
for as on my part I produce the words of God Himself, “My heart hath emitted my most
excellent Word,”7876 so you in like manner ought to adduce in opposition to me some text
where God has said, “My heart hath emitted Myself as my own most excellent Word,” in
such a sense that He is Himself both the Emitter and the Emitted, both He who sent forth
and He who was sent forth, since He is both the Word and God. I bid you also observe,7877
that on my side I advance the passage where the Father said to the Son, “Thou art my Son,
this day have I begotten Thee.”7878 If you want me to believe Him to be both the Father and
the Son, show me some other passage where it is declared, “The Lord said unto Himself, I
am my own Son, to-day have I begotten myself;” or again, “Before the morning did I beget
myself;”7879 and likewise, “I the Lord possessed Myself the beginning of my ways for my
own works; before all the hills, too, did I beget myself;”7880 and whatever other passages are
to the same effect. Why, moreover, could God the Lord of all things, have hesitated to speak
thus of Himself, if the fact had been so? Was He afraid of not being believed, if He had in
so many words declared Himself to be both the Father and the Son? Of one thing He was
at any rate afraid—of lying. Of Himself, too, and of His own truth, was He afraid. Believing
Him, therefore, to be the true God, I am sure that He declared nothing to exist in any other

way than according to His own dispensation and arrangement, and that He had arranged
nothing in any other way than according to His own declaration. On your side, however,
you must make Him out to be a liar, and an impostor, and a tamperer with His word, if,
when He was Himself a Son to Himself, He assigned the part of His Son to be played by
another, when all the Scriptures attest the clear existence of, and distinction in (the Persons
of) the Trinity, and indeed furnish us with our Rule of faith, that He who speaks, and He of
whom He speaks, and to whom He speaks, cannot possibly seem to be One and the Same.
So absurd and misleading a statement would be unworthy of God, that, when it was Himself
to whom He was speaking, He speaks rather to another, and not to His very self. Hear, then,
other utterances also of the Father concerning the Son by the mouth of Isaiah: “Behold my
Son, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom I am well pleased: I will put my Spirit upon
Him, and He shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.”7881 Hear also what He says to the
Son: “Is it a great thing for Thee, that Thou shouldest be called my Son to raise up the tribes
of Jacob, and to restore the dispersed of Israel? I have given Thee for a light to the Gentiles,
that Thou mayest be their salvation to the end of the earth.”7882 Hear now also the Son’s
utterances respecting the Father: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath
anointed me to preach the gospel unto men.”7883 He speaks of Himself likewise to the
Father in the Psalm: “Forsake me not until I have declared the might of Thine arm to all the
generation that is to come.”7884 Also to the same purport in another Psalm: “O Lord, how
are they increased that trouble me!”7885 But almost all the Psalms which prophesy of7886
the person of Christ, represent the Son as conversing with the Father—that is, represent
Christ (as speaking) to God. Observe also the Spirit speaking of the Father and the Son, in
the character of7887 a third Person: “The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right
hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool.”7888 Likewise in the words of Isaiah: “Thus
saith the Lord to the Lord7889 mine Anointed.”7890 Likewise, in the same prophet, He says
to the Father respecting the Son: “Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the
arm of the Lord revealed? We brought a report concerning Him, as if He were a little child,

as if He were a root in a dry ground, who had no form nor comeliness.”7891 These are a few
testimonies out of many; for we do not pretend to bring up all the passages of Scripture,
because we have a tolerably large accumulation of them in the various heads of our subject,
as we in our several chapters call them in as our witnesses in the fulness of their dignity and
authority.7892 Still, in these few quotations the distinction of Persons in the Trinity is clearly
set forth. For there is the Spirit Himself who speaks, and the Father to whom He speaks,
and the Son of whom He speaks.7893 In the same manner, the other passages also establish
each one of several Persons in His special character—addressed as they in some cases are
to the Father or to the Son respecting the Son, in other cases to the Son or to the Father
concerning the Father, and again in other instances to the (Holy) Spirit.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Other Quotations from Holy Scripture Adduced in Proof of the
Plurality of Persons in the Godhead.</head>
<p>If the number of the Trinity also offends you, as if it were not connected in the simple
Unity, I ask you how it is possible for a Being who is merely and absolutely One and Singular,
to speak in plural phrase, saying, “Let us make man in our own image, and after our own
likeness;”7894 whereas He ought to have said, “Let me make man in my own image, and
after my own likeness,” as being a unique and singular Being? In the following passage,
however, “Behold the man is become as one of us,”7895 He is either deceiving or amusing
us in speaking plurally, if He is One only and singular. Or was it to the angels that He spoke,
as the Jews interpret the passage, because these also acknowledge not the Son? Or was it
because He was at once the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, that He spoke to Himself in
plural terms, making Himself plural on that very account? Nay, it was because He had
already His Son close at His side, as a second Person, His own Word, and a third Person
also, the Spirit in the Word, that He purposely adopted the plural phrase, “Let us make;”
and, “in our image;” and, “become as one of us.” For with whom did He make man? and to
whom did He make him like? (The answer must be), the Son on the one hand, who was one
day to put on human nature; and the Spirit on the other, who was to sanctify man. With
these did He then speak, in the Unity of the Trinity, as with His ministers and witnesses. In
the following text also He distinguishes among the Persons: “So God created man in His
own image; in the image of God created He him.”7896 Why say “image of God?” Why not
“His own image” merely, if He was only one who was the Maker, and if there was not also
One in whose image He made man? But there was One in whose image God was making
man, that is to say, Christ’s image, who, being one day about to become Man (more surely
and more truly so), had already caused the man to be called His image, who was then going
to be formed of clay—the image and similitude of the true and perfect Man. But in respect
of the previous works of the world what says the Scripture? Its first statement indeed is
made, when the Son has not yet appeared: “And God said, Let there be light, and there was
light.”7897 Immediately there appears the Word, “that true light, which lighteth man on his
coming into the world,”7898 and through Him also came light upon the world.7899 From
that moment God willed creation to be effected in the Word, Christ being present and
ministering unto Him: and so God created. And God said, “Let there be a firmament,…and

God made the firmament;”7900 and God also said, “Let there be lights (in the firmament);
and so God made a greater and a lesser light.”7901 But all the rest of the created things did
He in like manner make, who made the former ones—I mean the Word of God, “through
whom all things were made, and without whom nothing was made.”7902 Now if He too is
God, according to John, (who says,) “The Word was God,”7903 then you have two Beings—
One that commands that the thing be made, and the Other that executes the order
and creates. In what sense, however, you ought to understand Him to be another, I have
already explained, on the ground of Personality, not of Substance—in the way of distinction,
not of division.7904 But although I must everywhere hold one only substance in three coherent
and inseparable (Persons), yet I am bound to acknowledge, from the necessity of the case,
that He who issues a command is different from Him who executes it. For, indeed, He would
not be issuing a command if He were all the while doing the work Himself, while ordering
it to be done by the second.7905 But still He did issue the command, although He would not
have intended to command Himself if He were only one; or else He must have worked
without any command, because He would not have waited to command Himself.</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—The Force of Sundry Passages of Scripture Illustrated in Relation to
the Plurality of Persons and Unity of Substance. There is No Polytheism Here,
Since the Unity is Insisted on as a Remedy Against Polytheism.</head>
<p>Well then, you reply, if He was God who spoke, and He was also God who created, at
this rate, one God spoke and another created; (and thus) two Gods are declared. If you are
so venturesome and harsh, reflect a while; and that you may think the better and more deliberately,
listen to the psalm in which Two are described as God: “Thy throne, O God, is
for ever and ever; the sceptre of Thy kingdom is a sceptre of righteousness. Thou hast loved
righteousness, and hated iniquity: therefore God, even Thy God, hath anointed Thee or
made Thee His Christ.”7906 Now, since He here speaks to God, and affirms that God is
anointed by God, He must have affirmed that Two are God, by reason of the sceptre’s royal
power. Accordingly, Isaiah also says to the Person of Christ: “The Sabæans, men of stature,
shall pass over to Thee; and they shall follow after Thee, bound in fetters; and they shall
worship Thee, because God is in Thee: for Thou art our God, yet we knew it not; Thou art
the God of Israel.”7907 For here too, by saying, “God is in Thee,” and “Thou art God,” he
sets forth Two who were God: (in the former expression in Thee, he means) in Christ, and
(in the other he means) the Holy Ghost. That is a still grander statement which you will find
expressly made in the Gospel: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word was God.”7908 There was One “who was,” and there was another “with whom”
He was. But I find in Scripture the name Lord also applied to them Both: “The Lord said
unto my Lord, Sit Thou on my right hand.”7909 And Isaiah says this: “Lord, who hath believed
our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?”7910 Now he would most certainly
have said Thine Arm, if he had not wished us to understand that the Father is Lord, and the
Son also is Lord. A much more ancient testimony we have also in Genesis: “Then the Lord
rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.”
7911 Now, either deny that this is Scripture; or else (let me ask) what sort of man you
are, that you do not think words ought to be taken and understood in the sense in which
they are written, especially when they are not expressed in allegories and parables, but in
determinate and simple declarations? If, indeed, you follow those who did not at the time

Him to be the Lord, then (I ask you) call to mind along with them the passage where it is
written, “I have said, Ye are gods, and ye are children of the Most High;”7912 and again,
“God standeth in the congregation of gods;”7913 in order that, if the Scripture has not been
afraid to designate as gods human beings, who have become sons of God by faith, you may
be sure that the same Scripture has with greater propriety conferred the name of the Lord
on the true and one only Son of God. Very well! you say, I shall challenge you to preach
from this day forth (and that, too, on the authority of these same Scriptures) two Gods and
two Lords, consistently with your views. God forbid, (is my reply). For we, who by the grace
of God possess an insight into both the times and the occasions of the Sacred Writings, especially
we who are followers of the Paraclete, not of human teachers, do indeed definitively
declare that Two Beings are God, the Father and the Son, and, with the addition of the Holy
Spirit, even Three, according to the principle of the divine economy, which introduces
number, in order that the Father may not, as you perversely infer, be Himself believed to
have been born and to have suffered, which it is not lawful to believe, forasmuch as it has
not been so handed down. That there are, however, two Gods or two Lords, is a statement
which at no time proceeds out of our mouth: not as if it were untrue that the Father is God,
and the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, and each is God; but because in earlier times
Two were actually spoken of as God, and two as Lord, that when Christ should come He
might be both acknowledged as God and designated as Lord, being the Son of Him who is
both God and Lord. Now, if there were found in the Scriptures but one Personality of Him
who is God and Lord, Christ would justly enough be inadmissible to the title of God and
Lord: for (in the Scriptures) there was declared to be none other than One God and One
Lord, and it must have followed that the Father should Himself seem to have come down
(to earth), inasmuch as only One God and One Lord was ever read of (in the Scriptures),
and His entire Economy would be involved in obscurity, which has been planned and arranged
with so clear a foresight in His providential dispensation as matter for our faith. As
soon, however, as Christ came, and was recognised by us as the very Being who had from
the beginning7914 caused plurality7915 (in the Divine Economy), being the second from the
Father, and with the Spirit the third, and Himself declaring and manifesting the Father more
fully (than He had ever been before), the title of Him who is God and Lord was at once restored
to the Unity (of the Divine Nature), even because the Gentiles would have to pass
from the multitude of their idols to the One Only God, in order that a difference might be
distinctly settled between the worshippers of One God and the votaries of polytheism. For

it was only right that Christians should shine in the world as “children of light,” adoring
and invoking Him who is the One God and Lord as “the light of the world.” Besides, if, from
that perfect knowledge7916 which assures us that the title of God and Lord is suitable both
to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, we were to invoke a plurality of gods
and lords, we should quench our torches, and we should become less courageous to endure
the martyr’s sufferings, from which an easy escape would everywhere lie open to us, as soon
as we swore by a plurality of gods and lords, as sundry heretics do, who hold more gods
than One. I will therefore not speak of gods at all, nor of lords, but I shall follow the apostle;
so that if the Father and the Son, are alike to be invoked, I shall call the Father “God,” and
invoke Jesus Christ as “Lord.”7917 But when Christ alone (is mentioned), I shall be able to
call Him “God,” as the same apostle says: “Of whom is Christ, who is over all, God blessed
for ever.”7918 For I should give the name of “sun” even to a sunbeam, considered in itself;
but if I were mentioning the sun from which the ray emanates, I certainly should at once
withdraw the name of sun from the mere beam. For although I make not two suns, still I
shall reckon both the sun and its ray to be as much two things and two forms7919 of one
undivided substance, as God and His Word, as the Father and the Son.</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.—The Natural Invisibility of the Father, and the Visibility of the Son
Witnessed in Many Passages of the Old Testament. Arguments of Their Distinctness,
Thus Supplied.</head>
<p>Moreover, there comes to our aid, when we insist upon the Father and the Son as being
Two, that regulating principle which has determined God to be invisible. When Moses in
Egypt desired to see the face of the Lord, saying, “If therefore I have found grace in Thy
sight, manifest Thyself unto me, that I may see Thee and know Thee,”7920 God said, “Thou
canst not see my face; for there shall no man see me, and live:”7921 in other words, he who
sees me shall die. Now we find that God has been seen by many persons, and yet that no
one who saw Him died (at the sight). The truth is, they saw God according to the faculties
of men, but not in accordance with the full glory of the Godhead. For the patriarchs are
said to have seen God (as Abraham and Jacob), and the prophets (as, for instance Isaiah
and Ezekiel), and yet they did not die. Either, then, they ought to have died, since they had
seen Him—for (the sentence runs), “No man shall see God, and live;” or else if they saw
God, and yet did not die, the Scripture is false in stating that God said, “If a man see my
face, he shall not live.” Either way, the Scripture misleads us, when it makes God invisible,
and when it produces Him to our sight. Now, then, He must be a different Being who was
seen, because of one who was seen it could not be predicated that He is invisible. It will
therefore follow, that by Him who is invisible we must understand the Father in the fulness
of His majesty, while we recognise the Son as visible by reason of the dispensation of His
derived existence;7922 even as it is not permitted us to contemplate the sun, in the full amount
of his substance which is in the heavens, but we can only endure with our eyes a ray, by
reason of the tempered condition of this portion which is projected from him to the earth.
Here some one on the other side may be disposed to contend that the Son is also invisible
as being the Word, and as being also the Spirit;7923 and, while claiming one nature for the
Father and the Son, to affirm that the Father is rather One and the Same Person with the
Son. But the Scripture, as we have said, maintains their difference by the distinction it makes
between the Visible and the Invisible. They then go on to argue to this effect, that if it was
the Son who then spake to Moses, He must mean it of Himself that His face was visible to
no one, because He was Himself indeed the invisible Father in the name of the Son. And by
this means they will have it that the Visible and the Invisible are one and the same, just as
the Father and the Son are the same; (and this they maintain) because in a preceding passage,

<pb n="1363"/>
before He had refused (the sight of) His face to Moses, the Scripture informs us that “the
Lord spake face to face with Moses, even as a man speaketh unto his friend;”7924 just as
Jacob also says, “I have seen God face to face.”7925 Therefore the Visible and the Invisible
are one and the same; and both being thus the same, it follows that He is invisible as the
Father, and visible as the Son. As if the Scripture, according to our exposition of it, were
inapplicable to the Son, when the Father is set aside in His own invisibility. We declare,
however, that the Son also, considered in Himself (as the Son), is invisible, in that He is
God, and the Word and Spirit of God; but that He was visible before the days of His flesh,
in the way that He says to Aaron and Miriam, “And if there shall be a prophet amongst you,
I will make myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream; not as with
Moses, with whom I shall speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, that is to say, in truth,
and not enigmatically,” that is to say, in image;7926 as the apostle also expresses it, “Now we
see through a glass, darkly (or enigmatically), but then face to face.”7927 Since, therefore,
He reserves to some future time His presence and speech face to face with Moses—a
promise which was afterwards fulfilled in the retirement of the mount (of transfiguration),
when as we read in the Gospel, “Moses appeared talking with Jesus”7928—it is evident that
in early times it was always in a glass, (as it were,) and an enigma, in vision and dream, that
God, I mean the Son of God, appeared—to the prophets and the patriarchs, as also to Moses
indeed himself. And even if the Lord did possibly7929 speak with him face to face, yet it was
not as man that he could behold His face, unless indeed it was in a glass, (as it were,) and
by enigma. Besides, if the Lord so spake with Moses, that Moses actually discerned His face,
eye to eye,7930 how comes it to pass that immediately afterwards, on the same occasion, he
desires to see His face,7931 which he ought not to have desired, because he had already seen
it? And how, in like manner, does the Lord also say that His face cannot be seen, because
He had shown it, if indeed He really had, (as our opponents suppose). Or what is that face
of God, the sight of which is refused, if there was one which was visible to man? “I have seen
God,” says Jacob, “face to face, and my life is preserved.”7932 There ought to be some other
face which kills if it be only seen. Well, then, was the Son visible? (Certainly not,7933) although

He was the face of God, except only in vision and dream, and in a glass and enigma, because
the Word and Spirit (of God) cannot be seen except in an imaginary form. But, (they say,)
He calls the invisible Father His face. For who is the Father? Must He not be the face of the
Son, by reason of that authority which He obtains as the begotten of the Father? For is there
not a natural propriety in saying of some personage greater (than yourself), That man is my
face; he gives me his countenance? “My Father,” says Christ, “is greater than I.”7934 Therefore
the Father must be the face of the Son. For what does the Scripture say? “The Spirit of His
person is Christ the Lord.”7935 As therefore Christ is the Spirit of the Father’s person, there
is good reason why, in virtue indeed of the unity, the Spirit of Him to whose person He belonged—
that is to say, the Father—pronounced Him to be His “face.” Now this, to be sure,
is an astonishing thing, that the Father can be taken to be the face of the Son, when He is
His head; for “the head of Christ is God.”7936</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—New Testament Passages Quoted. They Attest the Same Truth of the
Son’s Visibility Contrasted with the Father’s Invisibility.</head>
<p>If I fail in resolving this article (of our faith) by passages which may admit of dispute7937
out of the Old Testament, I will take out of the New Testament a confirmation of our view,
that you may not straightway attribute to the Father every possible (relation and condition)
which I ascribe to the Son. Behold, then, I find both in the Gospels and in the (writings of
the) apostles a visible and an invisible God (revealed to us), under a manifest and personal
distinction in the condition of both. There is a certain emphatic saying by John: “No man
hath seen God at any time;”7938 meaning, of course, at any previous time. But he has indeed
taken away all question of time, by saying that God had never been seen. The apostle confirms
this statement; for, speaking of God, he says, “Whom no man hath seen, nor can see;”7939
because the man indeed would die who should see Him.7940 But the very same apostles
testify that they had both seen and “handled” Christ.7941 Now, if Christ is Himself both the
Father and the Son, how can He be both the Visible and the Invisible? In order, however,
to reconcile this diversity between the Visible and the Invisible, will not some one on the
other side argue that the two statements are quite correct: that He was visible indeed in the
flesh, but was invisible before His appearance in the flesh; so that He who as the Father was
invisible before the flesh, is the same as the Son who was visible in the flesh? If, however,
He is the same who was invisible before the incarnation, how comes it that He was actually
seen in ancient times before (coming in) the flesh? And by parity of reasoning, if He is the
same who was visible after (coming in) the flesh, how happens it that He is now declared
to be invisible by the apostles? How, I repeat, can all this be, unless it be that He is one, who
anciently was visible only in mystery and enigma, and became more clearly visible by His
incarnation, even the Word who was also made flesh; whilst He is another whom no man
has seen at any time, being none else than the Father, even Him to whom the Word belongs?
Let us, in short, examine who it is whom the apostles saw. “That,” says John, “which we
have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the
Word of life.”7942 Now the Word of life became flesh, and was heard, and was seen, and
was handled, because He was flesh who, before He came in the flesh, was the “Word in the
beginning with God” the Father,7943 and not the Father with the Word. For although the

Word was God, yet was He with God, because He is God of God; and being joined to the
Father, is with the Father.7944 “And we have seen His glory, the glory as of the only begotten
of the Father;”7945 that is, of course, (the glory) of the Son, even Him who was visible, and
was glorified by the invisible Father. And therefore, inasmuch as he had said that the Word
of God was God, in order that he might give no help to the presumption of the adversary,
(which pretended) that he had seen the Father Himself and in order to draw a distinction
between the invisible Father and the visible Son, he makes the additional assertion, ex
abundanti as it were: “No man hath seen God at any time.”7946 What God does he mean?
The Word? But he has already said: “Him we have seen and heard, and our hands have
handled the Word of life.” Well, (I must again ask,) what God does he mean? It is of course
the Father, with whom was the Word, the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the
Father, and has Himself declared Him.7947 He was both heard and seen and, that He might
not be supposed to be a phantom, was actually handled. Him, too, did Paul behold; but yet
he saw not the Father. “Have I not,” he says, “seen Jesus Christ our Lord?”7948 Moreover,
he expressly called Christ God, saying: “Of whom are the fathers, and of whom as concerning
the flesh Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever.”7949 He shows us also that the
Son of God, which is the Word of God, is visible, because He who became flesh was called
Christ. Of the Father, however, he says to Timothy: “Whom none among men hath seen,
nor indeed can see;” and he accumulates the description in still ampler terms: “Who only
hath immortality, and dwelleth in the light which no man can approach unto.”7950 It was
of Him, too, that he had said in a previous passage: “Now unto the King eternal, immortal,
invisible, to the only God;”7951 so that we might apply even the contrary qualities to the Son
Himself—mortality, accessibility—of whom the apostle testifies that “He died according to
the Scriptures,”7952 and that “He was seen by himself last of all,”7953—by means, of course,
of the light which was accessible, although it was not without imperilling his sight that he
experienced that light.7954 A like danger to which also befell Peter, and John, and James,

(who confronted not the same light) without risking the loss of their reason and mind; and
if they, who were unable to endure the glory of the Son,7955 had only seen the Father, they
must have died then and there: “For no man shall see God, and live.”7956 This being the
case, it is evident that He was always seen from the beginning, who became visible in the
end; and that He, (on the contrary,) was not seen in the end who had never been visible
from the beginning; and that accordingly there are two—the Visible and the Invisible. It
was the Son, therefore, who was always seen, and the Son who always conversed with men,
and the Son who has always worked by the authority and will of the Father; because “the
Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the Father do”7957—“do” that is, in His
mind and thought.7958 For the Father acts by mind and thought; whilst the Son, who is in
the Father’s mind and thought,7959 gives effect and form to what He sees. Thus all things
were made by the Son, and without Him was not anything made.7960</p>

<head>Chapter XVI.—Early Manifestations of the Son of God, as Recorded in the Old
Testament; Rehearsals of His Subsequent Incarnation.</head>
<p>But you must not suppose that only the works which relate to the (creation of the) world
were made by the Son, but also whatsoever since that time has been done by God. For “the
Father who loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand,”7961 loves Him indeed
from the beginning, and from the very first has handed all things over to Him. Whence it
is written, “From the beginning the Word was with God, and the Word was God;”7962 to
whom “is given by the Father all power in heaven and on earth.”7963 “The Father judgeth
no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son”7964—from the very beginning even.
For when He speaks of all power and all judgment, and says that all things were made by
Him, and all things have been delivered into His hand, He allows no exception (in respect)
of time, because they would not be all things unless they were the things of all time. It is the
Son, therefore, who has been from the beginning administering judgment, throwing down
the haughty tower, and dividing the tongues, punishing the whole world by the violence of
waters, raining upon Sodom and Gomorrah fire and brimstone, as the Lord from the Lord.
For He it was who at all times came down to hold converse with men, from Adam on to the
patriarchs and the prophets, in vision, in dream, in mirror, in dark saying; ever from the
beginning laying the foundation of the course of His dispensations, which He meant to follow
out to the very last. Thus was He ever learning even as God to converse with men upon
earth, being no other than the Word which was to be made flesh. But He was thus learning
(or rehearsing), in order to level for us the way of faith, that we might the more readily believe
that the Son of God had come down into the world, if we knew that in times past also
something similar had been done.7965 For as it was on our account and for our learning that
these events are described in the Scriptures, so for our sakes also were they done—(even
ours, I say), “upon whom the ends of the world are come.”7966 In this way it was that even
then He knew full well what human feelings and affections were, intending as He always
did to take upon Him man’s actual component substances, body and soul, making inquiry
of Adam (as if He were ignorant),7967 “Where art thou, Adam?”7968—repenting that He

was in man; offended with persons, and then reconciled to them; and whatever other
(weaknesses and imperfections) the heretics lay hold of (in their assumptions) as unworthy
of God, in order to discredit the Creator, not considering that these circumstances are suitable
enough for the Son, who was one day to experience even human sufferings—hunger and
thirst, and tears, and actual birth and real death, and in respect of such a dispensation “made
by the Father a little less than the angels.”7970 But the heretics, you may be sure, will not
allow that those things are suitable even to the Son of God, which you are imputing to the
very Father Himself, when you pretend7971 that He made Himself less (than the angels) on
our account; whereas the Scripture informs us that He who was made less was so affected
by another, and not Himself by Himself. What, again, if He was One who was “crowned
with glory and honour,” and He Another by whom He was so crowned,7972—the Son, in
fact, by the Father? Moreover, how comes it to pass, that the Almighty Invisible God, “whom
no man hath seen nor can see; He who dwelleth in light unapproachable;”7973 “He who
dwelleth not in temples made with hands;”7974 “from before whose sight the earth trembles,
and the mountains melt like wax;”7975 who holdeth the whole world in His hand “like a
nest;”7976 “whose throne is heaven, and earth His footstool;”7977 in whom is every place,
but Himself is in no place; who is the utmost bound of the universe;—how happens it, I say,
that He (who, though) the Most High, should yet have walked in paradise towards the cool
of the evening, in quest of Adam; and should have shut up the ark after Noah had entered
it; and at Abraham’s tent should have refreshed Himself under an oak; and have called to
Moses out of the burning bush; and have appeared as “the fourth” in the furnace of the
Babylonian monarch (although He is there called the Son of man),—unless all these events
had happened as an image, as a mirror, as an enigma (of the future incarnation)? Surely
even these things could not have been believed even of the Son of God, unless they had been
given us in the Scriptures; possibly also they could not have been believed of the Father,
even if they had been given in the Scriptures, since these men bring Him down into Mary’s
womb, and set Him before Pilate’s judgment-seat, and bury Him in the sepulchre of Joseph.

Hence, therefore, their error becomes manifest; for, being ignorant that the entire order of
the divine administration has from the very first had its course through the agency of the
Son, they believe that the Father Himself was actually seen, and held converse with men,
and worked, and was athirst, and suffered hunger (in spite of the prophet who says: “The
everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, shall never thirst at all, nor
be hungry;”7978 much more, shall neither die at any time, nor be buried!), and therefore
that it was uniformly one God, even the Father, who at all times did Himself the things

<p>They more readily supposed that the Father acted in the Son’s name, than that the Son
acted in the Father’s; although the Lord says Himself, “I am come in my Father’s name;”7979
and even to the Father He declares, “I have manifested Thy name unto these men;”7980
whilst the Scripture likewise says, “Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord,”7981
that is to say, the Son in the Father’s name. And as for the Father’s names, God Almighty,
the Most High, the Lord of hosts, the King of Israel, the “One that is,” we say (for so much
do the Scriptures teach us) that they belonged suitably to the Son also, and that the Son
came under these designations, and has always acted in them, and has thus manifested them
in Himself to men. “All things,” says He, “which the Father hath are mine.”7982 Then why
not His names also? When, therefore, you read of Almighty God, and the Most High, and
the God of hosts, and the King of Israel, the “One that is,” consider whether the Son also be
not indicated by these designations, who in His own right is God Almighty, in that He is
the Word of Almighty God, and has received power over all; is the Most High, in that He
is “exalted at the right hand of God,” as Peter declares in the Acts;7983 is the Lord of hosts,
because all things are by the Father made subject to Him; is the King of Israel because to
Him has especially been committed the destiny of that nation; and is likewise “the One that
is,” because there are many who are called Sons, but are not. As to the point maintained by
them, that the name of Christ belongs also to the Father, they shall hear (what I have to say)
in the proper place. Meanwhile, let this be my immediate answer to the argument which
they adduce from the Revelation of John: “I am the Lord which is, and which was, and which
is to come, the Almighty;”7984 and from all other passages which in their opinion make the
designation of Almighty God unsuitable to the Son. As if, indeed, He which is to come were
not almighty; whereas even the Son of the Almighty is as much almighty as the Son of God
is God.</p>

<head>Chapter XVIII.—The Designation of the One God in the Prophetic Scriptures. Intended
as a Protest Against Heathen Idolatry, It Does Not Preclude the Correlative
Idea of the Son of God. The Son is in the Father.</head>
<p>But what hinders them from readily perceiving this community of the Father’s titles in
the Son, is the statement of Scripture, whenever it determines God to be but One; as if the
selfsame Scripture had not also set forth Two both as God and Lord, as we have shown
above.7985 Their argument is: Since we find Two and One, therefore Both are One and the
Same, both Father and Son. Now the Scripture is not in danger of requiring the aid of any
one’s argument, lest it should seem to be self-contradictory. It has a method of its own, both
when it sets forth one only God, and also when it shows that there are Two, Father and Son;
and is consistent with itself. It is clear that the Son is mentioned by it. For, without any
detriment to the Son, it is quite possible for it to have rightly determined that God is only
One, to whom the Son belongs; since He who has a Son ceases not on that account to exist,—
Himself being One only, that is, on His own account, whenever He is named without
the Son. And He is named without the Son whensoever He is defined as the principle (of
Deity) in the character of “its first Person,” which had to be mentioned before the name of
the Son; because it is the Father who is acknowledged in the first place, and after the Father
the Son is named. Therefore “there is one God,” the Father, “and without Him there is none
else.”7986 And when He Himself makes this declaration, He denies not the Son, but says
that there is no other God; and the Son is not different from the Father. Indeed, if you only
look carefully at the contexts which follow such statements as this, you will find that they
nearly always have distinct reference to the makers of idols and the worshippers thereof,
with a view to the multitude of false gods being expelled by the unity of the Godhead, which
nevertheless has a Son; and inasmuch as this Son is undivided and inseparable from the
Father, so is He to be reckoned as being in the Father, even when He is not named. The fact
is, if He had named Him expressly, He would have separated Him, saying in so many words:
“Beside me there is none else, except my Son.” In short He would have made His Son actually
another, after excepting Him from others. Suppose the sun to say, “I am the Sun, and there
is none other besides me, except my ray,” would you not have remarked how useless was
such a statement, as if the ray were not itself reckoned in the sun? He says, then, that there
is no God besides Himself in respect of the idolatry both of the Gentiles as well as of Israel;
nay, even on account of our heretics also, who fabricate idols with their words, just as the
heathen do with their hands; that is to say, they make another God and another Christ.
When, therefore, He attested His own unity, the Father took care of the Son’s interests, that
<note type="footnote">7985 See above ch. xiii. p. 607.</note>

Christ should not be supposed to have come from another God, but from Him who had
already said, “I am God and there is none other beside me,”7987 who shows us that He is
the only God, but in company with His Son, with whom “He stretcheth out the heavens
alone.”7988</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—The Son in Union with the Father in the Creation of All Things. This
Union of the Two in Co-Operation is Not Opposed to the True Unity of God.
It is Opposed Only to Praxeas’ Identification Theory.</head>
<p>But this very declaration of His they will hastily pervert into an argument of His singleness.
“I have,” says He, “stretched out the heaven alone.” Undoubtedly alone as regards all
other powers; and He thus gives a premonitory evidence against the conjectures of the
heretics, who maintain that the world was constructed by various angels and powers, who
also make the Creator Himself to have been either an angel or some subordinate agent sent
to form external things, such as the constituent parts of the world, but who was at the same
time ignorant of the divine purpose. If, now, it is in this sense that He stretches out the
heavens alone, how is it that these heretics assume their position so perversely, as to render
inadmissible the singleness of that Wisdom which says, “When He prepared the heaven, I
was present with Him?”7989—even though the apostle asks, “Who hath known the mind of
the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor?”7990 meaning, of course, to except that wisdom
which was present with Him.7991 In Him, at any rate, and with Him, did (Wisdom) construct
the universe, He not being ignorant of what she was making. “Except Wisdom,” however,
is a phrase of the same sense exactly as “except the Son,” who is Christ, “the Wisdom and
Power of God,”7992 according to the apostle, who only knows the mind of the Father. “For
who knoweth the things that be in God, except the Spirit which is in Him?”7993 Not, observe,
without Him. There was therefore One who caused God to be not alone, except “alone”
from all other gods. But (if we are to follow the heretics), the Gospel itself will have to be
rejected, because it tells us that all things were made by God through the Word, without
whom nothing was made.7994 And if I am not mistaken, there is also another passage in
which it is written: “By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the hosts of
them by His Spirit.”7995 Now this Word, the Power of God and the Wisdom of God, must
be the very Son of God. So that, if (He did) all things by the Son, He must have stretched
out the heavens by the Son, and so not have stretched them out alone, except in the sense
in which He is “alone” (and apart) from all other gods. Accordingly He says, concerning
the Son, immediately afterwards: “Who else is it that frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and

maketh diviners mad, turning wise men backward, and making their knowledge foolish,
and confirming the words7996 of His Son?”7997—as, for instance, when He said, “This is my
beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him.”7998 By thus attaching the Son to
Himself, He becomes His own interpreter in what sense He stretched out the heavens alone,
meaning alone with His Son, even as He is one with His Son. The utterance, therefore, will
be in like manner the Son’s, “I have stretched out the heavens alone,”7999 because by the
Word were the heavens established.8000 Inasmuch, then, as the heaven was prepared when
Wisdom was present in the Word, and since all things were made by the Word, it is quite
correct to say that even the Son stretched out the heaven alone, because He alone ministered
to the Father’s work. It must also be He who says, “I am the First, and to all futurity I
AM.”8001 The Word, no doubt, was before all things. “In the beginning was the Word;”8002
and in that beginning He was sent forth8003 by the Father. The Father, however, has no beginning,
as proceeding from none; nor can He be seen, since He was not begotten. He who
has always been alone could never have had order or rank. Therefore, if they have determined
that the Father and the Son must be regarded as one and the same, for the express purpose
of vindicating the unity of God, that unity of His is preserved intact; for He is one, and yet
He has a Son, who is equally with Himself comprehended in the same Scriptures. Since they
are unwilling to allow that the Son is a distinct Person, second from the Father, lest, being
thus second, He should cause two Gods to be spoken of, we have shown above8004 that Two
are actually described in Scripture as God and Lord. And to prevent their being offended
at this fact, we give a reason why they are not said to be two Gods and two Lords, but that
they are two as Father and Son; and this not by severance of their substance, but from the
dispensation wherein we declare the Son to be undivided and inseparable from the Father,—
distinct in degree, not in state. And although, when named apart, He is called God, He
does not thereby constitute two Gods, but one; and that from the very circumstance that
He is entitled to be called God, from His union with the Father.</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—The Scriptures Relied on by Praxeas to Support His Heresy But Few.
They are Mentioned by Tertullian.</head>
<p>But I must take some further pains to rebut their arguments, when they make selections
from the Scriptures in support of their opinion, and refuse to consider the other points,
which obviously maintain the rule of faith without any infraction of the unity of the Godhead,
and with the full admission8005 of the Monarchy. For as in the Old Testament Scriptures
they lay hold of nothing else than, “I am God, and beside me there is no God;”8006 so in the
Gospel they simply keep in view the Lord’s answer to Philip, “I and my Father are one;”8007
and, “He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and I am in the Father, and the Father in
me.”8008 They would have the entire revelation of both Testaments yield to these three
passages, whereas the only proper course is to understand the few statements in the light of
the many. But in their contention they only act on the principle of all heretics. For, inasmuch
as only a few testimonies are to be found (making for them) in the general mass, they pertinaciously
set off the few against the many, and assume the later against the earlier. The
rule, however, which has been from the beginning established for every case, gives its prescription
against the later assumptions, as indeed it also does against the fewer.</p>

<head>Chapter XXI.—In This and the Four Following Chapters It is Shewn, by a Minute
Analysis of St. John’s Gospel, that the Father and Son are Constantly Spoken of
as Distinct Persons.</head>
<p>Consider, therefore, how many passages present their prescriptive authority to you in
this very Gospel before this inquiry of Philip, and previous to any discussion on your part.
And first of all there comes at once to hand the preamble of John to his Gospel, which shows
us what He previously was who had to become flesh. “In the beginning was the Word, and
the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God: all
things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.”8009 Now, since these words
may not be taken otherwise than as they are written, there is without doubt shown to be
One who was from the beginning, and also One with whom He always was: one the Word
of God, the other God (although the Word is also God, but God regarded as the Son of God,
not as the Father); One through whom were all things, Another by whom were all things.
But in what sense we call Him Another we have already often described. In that we called
Him Another, we must needs imply that He is not identical—not identical indeed, yet not
as if separate; Other by dispensation, not by division. He, therefore, who became flesh was
not the very same as He from whom the Word came. “His glory was beheld—the glory as
of the only-begotten of the Father;”8010 not, (observe,) as of the Father. He “declared” (what
was in) “the bosom of the Father alone;”8011 the Father did not divulge the secrets of His
own bosom. For this is preceded by another statement: “No man hath seen God at any
time.”8012 Then, again, when He is designated by John (the Baptist) as “the Lamb of God,”8013
He is not described as Himself the same with Him of whom He is the beloved Son. He is, no
doubt, ever the Son of God, but yet not He Himself of whom He is the Son. This (divine
relationship) Nathanæl at once recognised in Him,8014 even as Peter did on another occasion:
“Thou art the Son of God.”8015 And He affirmed Himself that they were quite right in their
convictions; for He answered Nathanæl: “Because I said, I saw thee under the fig-tree,
therefore dost thou believe?”8016 And in the same manner He pronounced Peter to be
“blessed,” inasmuch as “flesh and blood had not revealed it to him”—that he had perceived

the Father—“but the Father which is in heaven.”8017 By asserting all this, He determined
the distinction which is between the two Persons: that is, the Son then on earth, whom
Peter had confessed to be the Son of God; and the Father in heaven, who had revealed to
Peter the discovery which he had made, that Christ was the Son of God. When He entered
the temple, He called it “His Father’s house,”8018 speaking as the Son. In His address to
Nicodemus He says: “So God loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that
whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”8019 And again:
“For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through
Him might be saved. He that believeth on Him is not condemned; but he that believeth not
is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son
of God.”8020 Moreover, when John (the Baptist) was asked what he happened to know of
Jesus, he said: “The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand. He that
believeth on the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life,
but the wrath of God abideth on him.”8021 Whom, indeed, did He reveal to the woman of
Samaria? Was it not “the Messias which is called Christ?”8022 And so He showed, of course,
that He was not the Father, but the Son; and elsewhere He is expressly called “the Christ,
the Son of God,”8023 and not the Father. He says, therefore,” My meat is to do the will of
Him that sent me, and to finish His work;”8024 whilst to the Jews He remarks respecting
the cure of the impotent man, “My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.”8025 “My Father
and I”—these are the Son’s words. And it was on this very account that “the Jews sought
the more intently to kill Him, not only because He broke the Sabbath, but also because He
said that God was His Father, thus making Himself equal with God. Then indeed did He
answer and say unto them, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He seeth the
Father do; for what things soever He doeth these also doeth the Son likewise. For the Father
loveth the Son, and showeth Him all things that He Himself doeth; and He will also show
Him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. For as the Father raiseth up the dead
and quickeneth them, even so the Son also quickeneth whom He will. For the Father judgeth
no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son, that all men should honour the

Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the
Father, who hath sent the Son. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my words, and
believeth on Him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation,
but is passed from death unto life. Verily I say unto you, that the hour is coming, when the
dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and when they have heard it, they shall live. For
as the Father hath eternal life in Himself, so also hath He given to the Son to have eternal
life in Himself; and He hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is
the Son of man”8026—that is, according to the flesh, even as He is also the Son of God
through His Spirit.8027 Afterwards He goes on to say: “But I have greater witness than that
of John; for the works which the Father hath given me to finish—those very works bear
witness of me that the Father hath sent me. And the Father Himself, which hath sent me,
hath also borne witness of me.”8028 But He at once adds, “Ye have neither heard His voice
at any time, nor seen His shape;”8029 thus affirming that in former times it was not the
Father, but the Son, who used to be seen and heard. Then He says at last: “I am come in my
Father’s name, and ye have not received me.”8030 It was therefore always the Son (of whom
we read) under the designation of the Almighty and Most High God, and King, and Lord.
To those also who inquired “what they should do to work the works of God,”8031 He answered,
“This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent.”8032 He also declares
Himself to be “the bread which the Father sent from heaven;”8033 and adds, that “all that
the Father gave Him should come to Him, and that He Himself would not reject them,8034
because He had come down from heaven not to do His own will, but the will of the Father;
and that the will of the Father was that every one who saw the Son, and believed on Him,
should obtain the life (everlasting,) and the resurrection at the last day. No man indeed was
able to come to Him, except the Father attracted him; whereas every one who had heard
and learnt of the Father came to Him.”8035 He goes on then expressly to say, “Not that any
man hath seen the Father;”8036 thus showing us that it was through the Word of the Father

<head>Chapter XXII.—Sundry Passages of St. John Quoted, to Show the Distinction Between

One—Shown to Be Against Him.</head>
<p>Again, whose doctrine does He announce, at which all were astonished?8040 Was it His
own or the Father’s? So, when they were in doubt among themselves whether He were the
Christ (not as being the Father, of course but as the Son), He says to them “You are not ignorant
whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but He that sent me is true, whom ye
know not; but I know Him, because I am from Him.”8041 He did not say, Because I myself
am He; and, I have sent mine own self: but His words are, “He hath sent me.” When, likewise,
the Pharisees sent men to apprehend Him, He says: “Yet a little while am I with you, and
(then) I go unto Him that sent me.”8042 When, however, He declares that He is not alone,
and uses these words, “but I and the Father that sent me,”8043 does He not show that there
are Two—Two, and yet inseparable? Indeed, this was the sum and substance of what He
was teaching them, that they were inseparably Two; since, after citing the law when it affirms
the truth of two men’s testimony,8044 He adds at once: “I am one who am bearing witness
of myself; and the Father (is another,) who hath sent me, and beareth witness of me.”8045
Now, if He were one—being at once both the Son and the Father—He certainly would not
have quoted the sanction of the law, which requires not the testimony of one, but of two.
Likewise, when they asked Him where His Father was,8046 He answered them, that they
had known neither Himself nor the Father; and in this answer He plainly told them of Two,
whom they were ignorant of. Granted that “if they had known Him, they would have known
the Father also,”8047 this certainly does not imply that He was Himself both Father and Son;
but that, by reason of the inseparability of the Two, it was impossible for one of them to be
either acknowledged or unknown without the other. “He that sent me,” says He, “is true;
and I am telling the world those things which I have heard of Him.”8048 And the Scripture
narrative goes on to explain in an exoteric manner, that “they understood not that He spake
to them concerning the Father,”8049 although they ought certainly to have known that the

Father’s words were uttered in the Son, because they read in Jeremiah, “And the Lord said
to me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth;”8050 and again in Isaiah, “The Lord hath
given to me the tongue of learning that I should understand when to speak a word in season.”
8051 In accordance with which, Christ Himself says: “Then shall ye know that I am He
and that I am saying nothing of my own self; but that, as my Father hath taught me, so I
speak, because He that sent me is with me.”8052 This also amounts to a proof that they were
Two, (although) undivided. Likewise, when upbraiding the Jews in His discussion with
them, because they wished to kill Him, He said, “I speak that which I have seen with my
Father, and ye do that which ye have seen with your father;”8053 “but now ye seek to kill
me, a man that hath told you the truth which I have heard of God;”8054 and again, “If God
were your Father, ye would love me, for I proceeded forth and came from God,”8055 (still
they are not hereby separated, although He declares that He proceeded forth from the
Father. Some persons indeed seize the opportunity afforded them in these words to propound
their heresy of His separation; but His coming out from God is like the ray’s procession from
the sun, and the river’s from the fountain, and the tree’s from the seed); “I have not a devil,
but I honour my Father;”8056 again, “If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my
Father that honoureth me, of whom ye say, that He is your God: yet ye have not known
Him, but I know Him; and if I should say, I know Him not, I shall be a liar like unto you;
but I know Him, and keep His saying.”8057 But when He goes on to say, “Your father Abra-
ham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad,”8058 He certainly proves that it was
not the Father that appeared to Abraham, but the Son. In like manner He declares, in the
case of the man born blind, “that He must do the works of the Father which had sent
Him;”8059 and after He had given the man sight, He said to him, “Dost thou believe in the
Son of God?” Then, upon the man’s inquiring who He was, He proceeded to reveal Himself
to him, as that Son of God whom He had announced to him as the right object of his faith.8060
In a later passage He declares that He is known by the Father, and the Father by Him;8061

adding that He was so wholly loved by the Father, that He was laying down His life, because
He had received this commandment from the Father.8062 When He was asked by the Jews
if He were the very Christ8063 (meaning, of course, the Christ of God; for to this day the
Jews expect not the Father Himself, but the Christ of God, it being nowhere said that the
Father will come as the Christ), He said to them, “I am telling you, and yet ye do not believe:
the works which I am doing, in my Father’s name, they actually bear witness of me.”8064
Witness of what? Of that very thing, to be sure, of which they were making inquiry—whether
He were the Christ of God. Then, again, concerning His sheep, and (the assurance) that no
man should pluck them out of His hand,8065 He says, “My Father, which gave them to me,
is greater than all;”8066 adding immediately, “I am and my Father are one.”8067 Here, then,
they take their stand, too infatuated, nay, too blind, to see in the first place that there is in
this passage an intimation of Two Beings—“I and my Father;” then that there is a plural
predicate, “are,” inapplicable to one person only; and lastly, that (the predicate terminates
in an abstract, not a personal noun)—“we are one thing” Unum, not “one person” Unus.
For if He had said “one Person,” He might have rendered some assistance to their opinion.
Unus, no doubt, indicates the singular number; but (here we have a case where) “Two” are
still the subject in the masculine gender. He accordingly says Unum, a neuter term, which
does not imply singularity of number, but unity of essence, likeness, conjunction, affection
on the Father’s part, who loves the Son, and submission on the Son’s, who obeys the Father’s
will. When He says, “I and my Father are one” in essence—Unum—He shows that there are
Two, whom He puts on an equality and unites in one. He therefore adds to this very statement,
that He “had showed them many works from the Father,” for none of which did He
deserve to be stoned.8068 And to prevent their thinking Him deserving of this fate, as if He
had claimed to be considered as God Himself, that is, the Father, by having said, “I and my
Father are One,” representing Himself as the Father’s divine Son, and not as God Himself,
He says, “If it is written in your law, I said, Ye are gods; and if the Scripture cannot be broken,
say ye of Him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, that He blasphemeth,
because He said, I am the Son of God? If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not;
but if I do, even if ye will not believe me, still believe the works; and know that I am in the
Father, and the Father in me.”8069 It must therefore be by the works that the Father is in

the Son, and the Son in the Father; and so it is by the works that we understand that the
Father is one with the Son. All along did He therefore strenuously aim at this conclusion,
that while they were of one power and essence, they should still be believed to be Two; for
otherwise, unless they were believed to be Two, the Son could not possibly be believed to
have any existence at all.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—More Passages from the Same Gospel in Proof of the Same Portion
of the Catholic Faith. Praxeas’ Taunt of Worshipping Two Gods Repudiated.</head>
<p>Again, when Martha in a later passage acknowledged Him to be the Son of God,8070
she no more made a mistake than Peter8071 and Nathanæl8072 had; and yet, even if she had
made a mistake, she would at once have learnt the truth: for, behold, when about to raise
her brother from the dead, the Lord looked up to heaven, and, addressing the Father, said—as
the Son, of course: “Father, I thank Thee that Thou always hearest me; it is because of these
crowds that are standing by that I have spoken to Thee, that they may believe that Thou hast
sent me.”8073 But in the trouble of His soul, (on a later occasion,) He said: “What shall I
say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause is it that I am come to this hour; only,
O Father, do Thou glorify Thy name”8074—in which He spake as the Son. (At another time)
He said: “I am come in my Father’s name.”8075 Accordingly, the Son’s voice was indeed
alone sufficient, (when addressed) to the Father. But, behold, with an abundance (of evidence)
8076 the Father from heaven replies, for the purpose of testifying to the Son: “This is
my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him.”8077 So, again, in that asseveration,
“I have both glorified, and will glorify again,”8078 how many Persons do you discover, obstinate
Praxeas? Are there not as many as there are voices? You have the Son on earth, you
have the Father in heaven. Now this is not a separation; it is nothing but the divine dispensation.
We know, however, that God is in the bottomless depths, and exists everywhere; but
then it is by power and authority. We are also sure that the Son, being indivisible from Him,
is everywhere with Him. Nevertheless, in the Economy or Dispensation itself, the Father
willed that the Son should be regarded8079 as on earth, and Himself in heaven; whither the
Son also Himself looked up, and prayed, and made supplication of the Father; whither also
He taught us to raise ourselves, and pray, “Our Father which art in heaven,” etc.,8080—although,
indeed, He is everywhere present. This heaven the Father willed to be His own

throne; while He made the Son to be “a little lower than the angels,”8081 by sending Him
down to the earth, but meaning at the same time to “crown Him with glory and honour,”8082
even by taking Him back to heaven. This He now made good to Him when He said: “I have
both glorified Thee, and will glorify Thee again.” The Son offers His request from earth, the
Father gives His promise from heaven. Why, then, do you make liars of both the Father
and the Son? If either the Father spake from heaven to the Son when He Himself was the
Son on earth, or the Son prayed to the Father when He was Himself the Son in heaven, how
happens it that the Son made a request of His own very self, by asking it of the Father, since
the Son was the Father? Or, on the other hand, how is it that the Father made a promise to
Himself, by making it to the Son, since the Father was the Son? Were we even to maintain
that they are two separate gods, as you are so fond of throwing out against us, it would be
a more tolerable assertion than the maintenance of so versatile and changeful a God as
yours! Therefore it was that in the passage before us the Lord declared to the people present:
“Not on my own account has this voice addressed me, but for your sakes,”8083 that these
likewise may believe both in the Father and in the Son, severally, in their own names and
persons and positions. “Then again, Jesus exclaims, and says, He that believeth on me, believeth
not on me, but on Him that sent me;”8084 because it is through the Son that men
believe in the Father, while the Father also is the authority whence springs belief in the Son.
“And he that seeth me, seeth Him that sent me.”8085 How so? Even because, (as He afterwards
declares,) “I have not spoken from myself, but the Father which sent me: He hath
given me a commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.”8086 For “the Lord
God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know when I ought to speak”8087
the word which I actually speak. “Even as the Father hath said unto me, so do I speak.”8088
Now, in what way these things were said to Him, the evangelist and beloved disciple John
knew better than Praxeas; and therefore he adds concerning his own meaning: “Now before
the feast of the passover, Jesus knew that the Father had given all things into His hands, and
that He had come from God, and was going to God.”8089 Praxeas, however, would have it
that it was the Father who proceeded forth from Himself, and had returned to Himself; so

that what the devil put into the heart of Judas was the betrayal, not of the Son, but of the
Father Himself. But for the matter of that, things have not turned out well either for the
devil or the heretic; because, even in the Son’s case, the treason which the devil wrought
against Him contributed nothing to his advantage. It was, then, the Son of God, who was
in the Son of man, that was betrayed, as the Scripture says afterwards: “Now is the Son of
man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.”8090 Who is here meant by “God?” Certainly
not the Father, but the Word of the Father, who was in the Son of man—that is in the flesh,
in which Jesus had been already glorified by the divine power and word. “And God,” says
He, “shall also glorify Him in Himself;”8091 that is to say, the Father shall glorify the Son,
because He has Him within Himself; and even though prostrated to the earth, and put to
death, He would soon glorify Him by His resurrection, and making Him conqueror over
death.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIV.—On St. Philip’s Conversation with Christ. He that Hath Seen Me,
Hath Seen the Father. This Text Explained in an Anti-Praxean Sense.</head>
<p>But there were some who even then did not understand. For Thomas, who was so long
incredulous, said: “Lord, we know not whither Thou goest; and how can we know the way?
Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father,
but by me. If ye had known me, ye would have known the Father also: but henceforth ye
know Him, and have seen Him.”8092 And now we come to Philip, who, roused with the
expectation of seeing the Father, and not understanding in what sense he was to take “seeing
the Father,” says: “Show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.”8093 Then the Lord answered
him: “Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?”8094
Now whom does He say that they ought to have known?—for this is the sole point of discussion.
Was it as the Father that they ought to have known Him, or as the Son? If it was as the
Father, Praxeas must tell us how Christ, who had been so long time with them, could have
possibly ever been (I will not say understood, but even) supposed to have been the Father.
He is clearly defined to us in all Scriptures—in the Old Testament as the Christ of God, in
the New Testament as the Son of God. In this character was He anciently predicted, in this
was He also declared even by Christ Himself; nay, by the very Father also, who openly confesses
Him from heaven as His Son, and as His Son glorifies Him. “This is my beloved Son;”
“I have glorified Him, and I will glorify Him.” In this character, too, was He believed on by
His disciples, and rejected by the Jews. It was, moreover, in this character that He wished
to be accepted by them whenever He named the Father, and gave preference to the Father,
and honoured the Father. This, then, being the case, it was not the Father whom, after His
lengthened intercourse with them, they were ignorant of, but it was the Son; and accordingly
the Lord, while upbraiding Philip for not knowing Himself who was the object of their ignorance,
wished Himself to be acknowledged indeed as that Being whom He had reproached
them for being ignorant of after so long a time—in a word, as the Son. And now it may be
seen in what sense it was said, “He that hath seen me hath seen the Father,”8095—even in
the same in which it was said in a previous passage, “I and my Father are one.”8096 Wherefore?
Because “I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world”8097 and, “I am
the way: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me;”8098 and, “No man can come to me,

except the Father draw him;”8099 and, “All things are delivered unto me by the Father;”8100
and, “As the Father quickeneth (the dead), so also doth the Son;”8101 and again, “If ye had
known me, ye would have known the Father also.”8102 For in all these passages He had
shown Himself to be the Father’s Commissioner,8103 through whose agency even the Father
could be seen in His works, and heard in His words, and recognised in the Son’s administration
of the Father’s words and deeds. The Father indeed was invisible, as Philip had learnt
in the law, and ought at the moment to have remembered: “No man shall see God, and
live.”8104 So he is reproved for desiring to see the Father, as if He were a visible Being, and
is taught that He only becomes visible in the Son from His mighty works, and not in the
manifestation of His person. If, indeed, He meant the Father to be understood as the same
with the Son, by saying, “He who seeth me seeth the Father,” how is it that He adds immediately
afterwards, “Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?”8105
He ought rather to have said: “Believest thou not that I am the Father?” With what view else
did He so emphatically dwell on this point, if it were not to clear up that which He wished
men to understand—namely, that He was the Son? And then, again, by saying, “Believest
thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me,”8106 He laid the greater stress on
His question on this very account, that He should not, because He had said, “He that hath
seen me, hath seen the Father,” be supposed to be the Father; because He had never wished
Himself to be so regarded, having always professed Himself to be the Son, and to have come
from the Father. And then He also set the conjunction of the two Persons in the clearest
light, in order that no wish might be entertained of seeing the Father as if He were separately
visible, and that the Son might be regarded as the representative of the Father. And yet He
omitted not to explain how the Father was in the Son and the Son in the Father. “The words,”
says He, “which I speak unto you, are not mine,”8107 because indeed they were the Father’s
words; “but the Father that dwelleth in me, He doeth the works.”8108 It is therefore by His
mighty works, and by the words of His doctrine, that the Father who dwells in the Son makes
Himself visible—even by those words and works whereby He abides in Him, and also by

this very circumstance, that He says, “I am in the Father, and the Father is in me.”8109 Accordingly
He adds: “Believe—” What? That I am the Father? I do not find that it is so
written, but rather, “that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or else believe me for my
works’ sake;”8110 meaning those works by which the Father manifested Himself to be in the
Son, not indeed to the sight of man, but to his intelligence.</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—The Paraclete, or Holy Ghost. He is Distinct from the Father and
the Son as to Their Personal Existence. One and Inseparable from Them as to
Their Divine Nature. Other Quotations Out of St. John’s Gospel.</head>
<p>What follows Philip’s question, and the Lord’s whole treatment of it, to the end of John’s
Gospel, continues to furnish us with statements of the same kind, distinguishing the Father
and the Son, with the properties of each. Then there is the Paraclete or Comforter, also,
which He promises to pray for to the Father, and to send from heaven after He had ascended
to the Father. He is called “another Comforter,” indeed;8111 but in what way He is another
we have already shown,8112 “He shall receive of mine,” says Christ,8113 just as Christ Himself
received of the Father’s. Thus the connection of the Father in the Son, and of the Son in the
Paraclete, produces three coherent Persons, who are yet distinct One from Another. These
Three are one8114 essence, not one Person,8115 as it is said, “I and my Father are One,”8116
in respect of unity of substance not singularity of number. Run through the whole Gospel,
and you will find that He whom you believe to be the Father (described as acting for the
Father, although you, for your part, forsooth, suppose that “the Father, being the husbandman,”
8117 must surely have been on earth) is once more recognised by the Son as in heaven,
when, “lifting up His eyes thereto,”8118 He commended His disciples to the safe-keeping of
the Father.8119 We have, moreover, in that other Gospel a clear revelation, i.e. of the Son’s
distinction from the Father, “My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?”8120 and again, (in the
third Gospel,) “Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.”8121 But even if (we had not
these passages, we meet with satisfactory evidence) after His resurrection and glorious victory
over death. Now that all the restraint of His humiliation is taken away, He might, if possible,
have shown Himself as the Father to so faithful a woman (as Mary Magdalene) when she
approached to touch Him, out of love, not from curiosity, nor with Thomas’ incredulity.
But not so; Jesus saith unto her, “Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father; but

the Father, He would have called them His children, (instead of His brethren), “and say unto
them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.”8122 Now,
does this mean, I ascend as the Father to the Father, and as God to God? Or as the Son to
the Father, and as the Word to God? Wherefore also does this Gospel, at its very termination,
intimate that these things were ever written, if it be not, to use its own words, “that ye might
believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God?”8123 Whenever, therefore, you take any of the
statements of this Gospel, and apply them to demonstrate the identity of the Father and the
Son, supposing that they serve your views therein, you are contending against the definite
purpose of the Gospel. For these things certainly are not written that you may believe that

<head>Chapter XXVI.—A Brief Reference to the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke. Their
Agreement with St. John, in Respect to the Distinct Personality of the Father
and the Son.</head>
<p>In addition to Philip’s conversation, and the Lord’s reply to it, the reader will observe
that we have run through John’s Gospel to show that many other passages of a clear purport,
both before and after that chapter, are only in strict accord with that single and prominent
statement, which must be interpreted agreeably to all other places, rather than in opposition
to them, and indeed to its own inherent and natural sense. I will not here largely use the
support of the other Gospels, which confirm our belief by the Lord’s nativity: it is sufficient
to remark that He who had to be born of a virgin is announced in express terms by the angel
himself as the Son of God: “The Spirit of God shall come upon thee, and the power of the
Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also the Holy Thing that shall be born of thee shall
be called the Son of God.”8125 On this passage even they will wish to raise a cavil; but truth
will prevail. Of course, they say, the Son of God is God, and the power of the highest is the
Most High. And they do not hesitate to insinuate8126 what, if it had been true, would have
been written. Whom was he8127 so afraid of as not plainly to declare, “God shall come upon
thee, and the Highest shall overshadow thee?” Now, by saying “the Spirit of God” (although
the Spirit of God is God,) and by not directly naming God, he wished that portion8128 of
the whole Godhead to be understood, which was about to retire into the designation of “the
Son.” The Spirit of God in this passage must be the same as the Word. For just as, when
John says, “The Word was made flesh,”8129 we understand the Spirit also in the mention of
the Word: so here, too, we acknowledge the Word likewise in the name of the Spirit. For
both the Spirit is the substance of the Word, and the Word is the operation of the Spirit,
and the Two are One (and the same).8130 Now John must mean One when he speaks of Him
as “having been made flesh,” and the angel Another when he announces Him as “about to
be born,” if the Spirit is not the Word, and the Word the Spirit. For just as the Word of God

is not actually He whose Word He is, so also the Spirit (although He is called God) is not
actually He whose Spirit He is said to be. Nothing which belongs to something else is actually
the very same thing as that to which it belongs. Clearly, when anything proceeds from a
personal subject,8131 and so belongs to him, since it comes from him, it may possibly be
such in quality exactly as the personal subject himself is from whom it proceeds, and to
whom it belongs. And thus the Spirit is God, and the Word is God, because proceeding
from God, but yet is not actually the very same as He from whom He proceeds. Now that
which is God of God, although He is an actually existing thing,8132 yet He cannot be God
Himself8133 (exclusively), but so far God as He is of the same substance as God Himself,
and as being an actually existing thing, and as a portion of the Whole. Much more will “the
power of the Highest” not be the Highest Himself, because It is not an actually existing
thing, as being Spirit—in the same way as the wisdom (of God) and the providence (of God)
is not God: these attributes are not substances, but the accidents of the particular substance.
Power is incidental to the Spirit, but cannot itself be the Spirit. These things, therefore,
whatsoever they are—(I mean) the Spirit of God, and the Word and the Power—having
been conferred on the Virgin, that which is born of her is the Son of God. This He Himself,
in those other Gospels also, testifies Himself to have been from His very boyhood: “Wist ye
not,” says He, “that I must be about my Father’s business?”8134 Satan likewise knew Him to
be this in his temptations: “Since Thou art the Son of God.”8135 This, accordingly, the devils
also acknowledge Him to be: “we know Thee, who Thou art, the Holy Son of God.”8136 His
“Father” He Himself adores.8137 When acknowledged by Peter as the “Christ (the Son) of
God,”8138 He does not deny the relation. He exults in spirit when He says to the Father, “I
thank Thee, O Father, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent.”8139
He, moreover, affirms also that to no man is the Father known, but to His Son;8140 and
promises that, as the Son of the Father, He will confess those who confess Him, and deny
those who deny Him, before His Father.8141 He also introduces a parable of the mission to

<head>Chapter XXVII.—The Distinction of the Father and the Son, Thus Established, He
Now Proves the Distinction of the Two Natures, Which Were, Without Confusion,
United in the Person of the Son. The Subterfuges of Praxeas Thus Exposed.</head>
<p>But why should I linger over matters which are so evident, when I ought to be attacking
points on which they seek to obscure the plainest proof? For, confuted on all sides on the
distinction between the Father and the Son, which we maintain without destroying their
inseparable union—as (by the examples) of the sun and the ray, and the fountain and the
river—yet, by help of (their conceit) an indivisible number, (with issues) of two and three,
they endeavour to interpret this distinction in a way which shall nevertheless tally with their
own opinions: so that, all in one Person, they distinguish two, Father and Son, understanding
the Son to be flesh, that is man, that is Jesus; and the Father to be spirit, that is God, that is
Christ. Thus they, while contending that the Father and the Son are one and the same, do
in fact begin by dividing them rather than uniting them. For if Jesus is one, and Christ is
another, then the Son will be different from the Father, because the Son is Jesus, and the
Father is Christ. Such a monarchy as this they learnt, I suppose, in the school of Valentinus,
making two—Jesus and Christ. But this conception of theirs has been, in fact, already confuted
in what we have previously advanced, because the Word of God or the Spirit of God
is also called the power of the Highest, whom they make the Father; whereas these relations8150
are not themselves the same as He whose relations they are said to be, but they
proceed from Him and appertain to Him. However, another refutation awaits them on this
point of their heresy. See, say they, it was announced by the angel: “Therefore that Holy
Thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.”8151 Therefore, (they argue,)
as it was the flesh that was born, it must be the flesh that is the Son of God. Nay, (I answer,)
this is spoken concerning the Spirit of God. For it was certainly of the Holy Spirit that the
virgin conceived; and that which He conceived, she brought forth. That, therefore, had to
be born which was conceived and was to be brought forth; that is to say, the Spirit, whose
“name should be called Emmanuel which, being interpreted, is, God with us.”8152 Besides,
the flesh is not God, so that it could not have been said concerning it, “That Holy Thing
shall be called the Son of God,” but only that Divine Being who was born in the flesh, of
whom the psalm also says, “Since God became man in the midst of it, and established it by
the will of the Father.”8153 Now what Divine Person was born in it? The Word, and the
Spirit which became incarnate with the Word by the will of the Father. The Word, therefore,

is incarnate; and this must be the point of our inquiry: How the Word became
flesh,—whether it was by having been transfigured, as it were, in the flesh, or by having
really clothed Himself in flesh. Certainly it was by a real clothing of Himself in flesh. For
the rest, we must needs believe God to be unchangeable, and incapable of form, as being
eternal. But transfiguration is the destruction of that which previously existed. For whatsoever
is transfigured into some other thing ceases to be that which it had been, and begins
to be that which it previously was not. God, however, neither ceases to be what He was, nor
can He be any other thing than what He is. The Word is God, and “the Word of the Lord
remaineth for ever,”—even by holding on unchangeably in His own proper form. Now, if
He admits not of being transfigured, it must follow that He be understood in this sense to
have become flesh, when He comes to be in the flesh, and is manifested, and is seen, and is
handled by means of the flesh; since all the other points likewise require to be thus understood.
For if the Word became flesh by a transfiguration and change of substance, it follows
at once that Jesus must be a substance compounded of8154 two substances—of flesh and
spirit,—a kind of mixture, like electrum, composed of gold and silver; and it begins to be
neither gold (that is to say, spirit) nor silver (that is to say, flesh),—the one being changed
by the other, and a third substance produced. Jesus, therefore, cannot at this rate be God
for He has ceased to be the Word, which was made flesh; nor can He be Man incarnate for
He is not properly flesh, and it was flesh which the Word became. Being compounded,
therefore, of both, He actually is neither; He is rather some third substance, very different
from either. But the truth is, we find that He is expressly set forth as both God and Man;
the very psalm which we have quoted intimating (of the flesh), that “God became Man in
the midst of it, He therefore established it by the will of the Father,”—certainly in all respects
as the Son of God and the Son of Man, being God and Man, differing no doubt according
to each substance in its own especial property, inasmuch as the Word is nothing else but
God, and the flesh nothing else but Man. Thus does the apostle also teach respecting His
two substances, saying, “who was made of the seed of David;”8155 in which words He will
be Man and Son of Man. “Who was declared to be the Son of God, according to the Spirit;”
8156 in which words He will be God, and the Word—the Son of God. We see plainly the
twofold state, which is not confounded, but conjoined in One Person—Jesus, God and Man.
Concerning Christ, indeed, I defer what I have to say.8157 (I remark here), that the property
of each nature is so wholly preserved, that the Spirit8158 on the one hand did all things in

Jesus suitable to Itself, such as miracles, and mighty deeds, and wonders; and the Flesh, on
the other hand, exhibited the affections which belong to it. It was hungry under the devil’s
temptation, thirsty with the Samaritan woman, wept over Lazarus, was troubled even unto
death, and at last actually died. If, however, it was only a tertium quid, some composite essence
formed out of the Two substances, like the electrum (which we have mentioned), there
would be no distinct proofs apparent of either nature. But by a transfer of functions, the
Spirit would have done things to be done by the Flesh, and the Flesh such as are effected by
the Spirit; or else such things as are suited neither to the Flesh nor to the Spirit, but confusedly
of some third character. Nay more, on this supposition, either the Word underwent death,
or the flesh did not die, if so be the Word was converted into flesh; because either the flesh
was immortal, or the Word was mortal. Forasmuch, however, as the two substances acted
distinctly, each in its own character, there necessarily accrued to them severally their own
operations, and their own issues. Learn then, together with Nicodemus, that “that which is
born in the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.”8159 Neither the flesh
becomes Spirit, nor the Spirit flesh. In one Person they no doubt are well able to be co-existent.
Of them Jesus consists—Man, of the flesh; of the Spirit, God—and the angel designated
Him as “the Son of God,”8160 in respect of that nature, in which He was Spirit, reserving
for the flesh the appellation “Son of Man.” In like manner, again, the apostle calls Him “the
Mediator between God and Men,”8161 and so affirmed His participation of both substances.
Now, to end the matter, will you, who interpret the Son of God to be flesh, be so good as to
show us what the Son of Man is? Will He then, I want to know, be the Spirit? But you insist
upon it that the Father Himself is the Spirit, on the ground that “God is a Spirit,” just as if
we did not read also that there is “the Spirit of God;” in the same manner as we find that as
“the Word was God,” so also there is “the Word of God.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXVIII.—Christ Not the Father, as Praxeas Said. The Inconsistency of This
Opinion, No Less Than Its Absurdity, Exposed. The True Doctrine of Jesus
Christ According to St. Paul, Who Agrees with Other Sacred Writers.</head>
<p>And so, most foolish heretic, you make Christ to be the Father, without once considering
the actual force of this name, if indeed Christ is a name, and not rather a surname, or designation;
for it signifies “Anointed.” But Anointed is no more a proper name than Clothed
or Shod; it is only an accessory to a name. Suppose now that by some means Jesus were also
called Vestitus (Clothed), as He is actually called Christ from the mystery of His anointing,
would you in like manner say that Jesus was the Son of God, and at the same time suppose
that Vestitus was the Father? Now then, concerning Christ, if Christ is the Father, the
Father is an Anointed One, and receives the unction of course from another. Else if it is
from Himself that He receives it, then you must prove it to us. But we learn no such fact
from the Acts of the Apostles in that ejaculation of the Church to God, “Of a truth, Lord,
against Thy Holy Child Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate
with the Gentiles and the people of Israel were gathered together.”8162 These then testified
both that Jesus was the Son of God, and that being the Son, He was anointed by the Father.
Christ therefore must be the same as Jesus who was anointed by the Father, and not the
Father, who anointed the Son. To the same effect are the words of Peter: “Let all the house
of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both
Lord and Christ,” that is, Anointed.8163 John, moreover, brands that man as “a liar” who
“denieth that Jesus is the Christ;” whilst on the other hand he declares that “every one is
born of God who believeth that Jesus is the Christ.”8164 Wherefore he also exhorts us to
believe in the name of His (the Father’s,) Son Jesus Christ, that “our fellowship may be with
the Father, and with His Son Jesus Christ.”8165 Paul, in like manner, everywhere speaks of
“God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ.” When writing to the Romans, he gives thanks
to God through our Lord Jesus Christ.8166 To the Galatians he declares himself to be “an
apostle not of men, neither by man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father.”8167 You
possess indeed all his writings, which testify plainly to the same effect, and set forth
Two—God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father. (They also testify)
that Jesus is Himself the Christ, and under one or the other designation the Son of God.

For precisely by the same right as both names belong to the same Person, even the Son of
God, does either name alone without the other belong to the same Person. Consequently,
whether it be the name Jesus which occurs alone, Christ is also understood, because Jesus
is the Anointed One; or if the name Christ is the only one given, then Jesus is identified with
Him, because the Anointed One is Jesus. Now, of these two names Jesus Christ, the former
is the proper one, which was given to Him by the angel; and the latter is only an adjunct,
predicable of Him from His anointing,—thus suggesting the proviso that Christ must be
the Son, not the Father. How blind, to be sure, is the man who fails to perceive that by the
name of Christ some other God is implied, if he ascribes to the Father this name of Christ!
For if Christ is God the Father, when He says, “I ascend unto my Father and your Father,
and to my God and your God,”8168 He of course shows plainly enough that there is above
Himself another Father and another God. If, again, the Father is Christ, He must be some
other Being who “strengtheneth the thunder, and createth the wind, and declareth unto
men His Christ.”8169 And if “the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered
together against the Lord and against His Christ,”8170 that Lord must be another Being,
against whose Christ were gathered together the kings and the rulers. And if, to quote another
passage, “Thus saith the Lord to my Lord Christ,”8171 the Lord who speaks to the
Father of Christ must be a distinct Being. Moreover, when the apostle in his epistle prays,
“That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and of
knowledge,”8172 He must be other (than Christ), who is the God of Jesus Christ, the bestower
of spiritual gifts. And once for all, that we may not wander through every passage, He “who
raised up Christ from the dead, and is also to raise up our mortal bodies,”8173 must certainly
be, as the quickener, different from the dead Father,8174 or even from the quickened Father,
if Christ who died is the Father.</p>

<head>Chapter XXIX.—It Was Christ that Died. The Father is Incapable of Suffering Either
Solely or with Another. Blasphemous Conclusions Spring from Praxeas’ Premises.</head>
<p>Silence! Silence on such blasphemy. Let us be content with saying that Christ died, the
Son of the Father; and let this suffice, because the Scriptures have told us so much. For even
the apostle, to his declaration—which he makes not without feeling the weight of it—that
“Christ died,” immediately adds, “according to the Scriptures,”8175 in order that he may
alleviate the harshness of the statement by the authority of the Scriptures, and so remove
offence from the reader. Now, although when two substances are alleged to be in
Christ—namely, the divine and the human—it plainly follows that the divine nature is immortal,
and that which is human is mortal, it is manifest in what sense he declares “Christ
died”—even in the sense in which He was flesh and Man and the Son of Man, not as being
the Spirit and the Word and the Son of God. In short, since he says that it was Christ (that
is, the Anointed One) that died, he shows us that that which died was the nature which was
anointed; in a word, the flesh. Very well, say you; since we on our side affirm our doctrine
in precisely the same terms which you use on your side respecting the Son, we are not guilty
of blasphemy against the Lord God, for we do not maintain that He died after the divine
nature, but only after the human. Nay, but you do blaspheme; because you allege not only
that the Father died, but that He died the death of the cross. For “cursed are they which are
hanged on a tree,”8176—a curse which, after the law, is compatible to the Son (inasmuch as
“Christ has been made a curse for us,”8177 but certainly not the Father); since, however, you
convert Christ into the Father, you are chargeable with blasphemy against the Father. But
when we assert that Christ was crucified, we do not malign Him with a curse; we only reaffirm8178
the curse pronounced by the law:8179 nor indeed did the apostle utter blasphemy
when he said the same thing as we.8180 Besides, as there is no blasphemy in predicating of
the subject that which is fairly applicable to it; so, on the other hand, it is blasphemy when
that is alleged concerning the subject which is unsuitable to it. On this principle, too, the
Father was not associated in suffering with the Son. The heretics, indeed, fearing to incur
direct blasphemy against the Father, hope to diminish it by this expedient: they grant us so
far that the Father and the Son are Two; adding that, since it is the Son indeed who suffers,
the Father is only His fellow-sufferer.8181 But how absurd are they even in this conceit! For

<pb n="1402"/>
what is the meaning of “fellow-suffering,” but the endurance of suffering along with another?
Now if the Father is incapable of suffering, He. is incapable of suffering in company with
another; otherwise, if He can suffer with another, He is of course capable of suffering. You,
in fact, yield Him nothing by this subterfuge of your fears. You are afraid to say that He is
capable of suffering whom you make to be capable of fellow-suffering. Then, again, the
Father is as incapable of fellow-suffering as the Son even is of suffering under the conditions
of His existence as God. Well, but how could the Son suffer, if the Father did not suffer with
Him? My answer is, The Father is separate from the Son, though not from Him as God. For
even if a river be soiled with mire and mud, although it flows from the fountain identical
in nature with it, and is not separated from the fountain, yet the injury which affects the
stream reaches not to the fountain; and although it is the water of the fountain which suffers
down the stream, still, since it is not affected at the fountain, but only in the river, the
fountain suffers nothing, but only the river which issues from the fountain. So likewise the
Spirit of God,8182 whatever suffering it might be capable of in the Son, yet, inasmuch as it
could not suffer in the Father, the fountain of the Godhead, but only in the Son, it evidently
could not have suffered,8183 as the Father. But it is enough for me that the Spirit of God
suffered nothing as the Spirit of God,8184 since all that It suffered It suffered in the Son. It
was quite another matter for the Father to suffer with the Son in the flesh. This likewise has
been treated by us. Nor will any one deny this, since even we are ourselves unable to suffer
for God, unless the Spirit of God be in us, who also utters by our instrumentality8185 whatever
pertains to our own conduct and suffering; not, however, that He Himself suffers in our
suffering, only He bestows on us the power and capacity of suffering.</p>

<head>Chapter XXX.—How the Son Was Forsaken by the Father Upon the Cross. The
True Meaning Thereof Fatal to Praxeas. So Too, the Resurrection of Christ, His
Ascension, Session at the Father’s Right Hand, and Mission of the Holy Ghost.</head>
<p>However, if you persist in pushing your views further, I shall find means of answering
you with greater stringency, and of meeting you with the exclamation of the Lord Himself,
so as to challenge you with the question, What is your inquiry and reasoning about that?
You have Him exclaiming in the midst of His passion: “My God, my God, why hast Thou
forsaken me?”8186 Either, then, the Son suffered, being “forsaken” by the Father, and the
Father consequently suffered nothing, inasmuch as He forsook the Son; or else, if it was the
Father who suffered, then to what God was it that He addressed His cry? But this was the
voice of flesh and soul, that is to say, of man—not of the Word and Spirit, that is to say, not
of God; and it was uttered so as to prove the impassibility of God, who “forsook” His Son,
so far as He handed over His human substance to the suffering of death. This verity the
apostle also perceived, when he writes to this effect: “If the Father spared not His own
Son.”8187 This did Isaiah before him likewise perceive, when he declared: “And the Lord
hath delivered Him up for our offences.”8188 In this manner He “forsook” Him, in not
sparing Him; “forsook” Him, in delivering Him up. In all other respects the Father did not
forsake the Son, for it was into His Father’s hands that the Son commended His spirit.8189
Indeed, after so commending it, He instantly died; and as the Spirit8190 remained with the
flesh, the flesh cannot undergo the full extent of death, i.e., in corruption and decay. For the
Son, therefore, to die, amounted to His being forsaken by the Father. The Son, then, both
dies and rises again, according to the Scriptures.8191 It is the Son, too, who ascends to the
heights of heaven,8192 and also descends to the inner parts of the earth.8193 “He sitteth at
the Father’s right hand”8194—not the Father at His own. He is seen by Stephen, at his martyrdom
by stoning, still sitting at the right hand of God8195 where He will continue to sit,
until the Father shall make His enemies His footstool.8196 He will come again on the clouds

substance—so to believe in One God as to refuse to reckon the Son besides Him, and after
the Son the Spirit. Now, what difference would there be between us and them, if there were
not this distinction which you are for breaking down? What need would there be of the
gospel, which is the substance of the New Covenant, laying down (as it does) that the Law
and the Prophets lasted until John the Baptist, if thenceforward the Father, the Son, and the
Spirit are not both believed in as Three, and as making One Only God? God was pleased to
renew His covenant with man in such a way as that His Unity might be believed in, after a
new manner, through the Son and the Spirit, in order that God might now be known
openly,8200 in His proper Names and Persons, who in ancient times was not plainly understood,

<p>“This volume contains all Tertullian’s polemical works (placed in his second volume by
Oehler, whose text we have followed), with the exception of the long treatise Against Marcion,
which has already formed a volume of this series, and the Adversus Judæos, which, not to
increase the bulk of the present volume, appears among the Miscellaneous Tracts.</p>
<p>“For the scanty facts connected with our author’s life, and for some general remarks on
the importance and style of his writings, the reader is referred to the Introduction of my
translation of the Five Books against Marcion.</p>
<p>“The treatises which comprise this volume will be found replete with the vigorous
thought and terse expression which always characterize Tertullian.</p>
<p>“Brief synopses are prefixed to the several treatises, and headings are supplied to the
chapters: these, with occasional notes on difficult passages and obscure allusions, will, it is
hoped, afford sufficient aid for an intelligent perusal of these ancient writings, which cannot
fail to be interesting alike to the theologian and the general reader,—full as they are of reverence
for revealed truth, and at the same time of independence of judgment, adorned with
admirable variety and fulness of knowledge, genial humour, and cultivated imagination.”</p>

<p>Dr. Holmes further adorned this same volume with a dedication to a valued friend, in
the following words:</p>
<p>“The Right Rev. Father in God, W. I. Trower, D.D., late Lord Bishop of Gibraltar, and
formerly Bishop of Glasgow and Galway:</p>
<p>My Dear Lord, In one of our conversations last summer, you were kind enough to express
an interest in this publication, and to favour me with some valuable hints on my own share
in it. It gives me therefore great pleasure to inscribe your honoured name on the first page
of this volume.</p>
<p>I avail myself of this public opportunity of endorsing, on my own account, the high
opinion which has long been entertained of your excellent volumes on The Epistles and The
Gospels.</p>
<p>Recalling to mind, as I often do, our pleasant days at Pennycross and Mannamead, I
remain, my dear Lord, very faithfully yours, Peter Holmes.”</p>

 <p>I.
(Sundry doctrinal statements of Tertullian. See p. 601 (et seqq.), supra.)</p>
<p>I am glad for many reasons that Dr. Holmes appends the following from Bishop Kaye’s
Account of the Writings of Tertullian:</p>
<p>“On the doctrine of the blessed Trinity, in order to explain his meaning Tertullian borrows
illustrations from natural objects. The three Persons of the Trinity stand to each other
in the relation of the root, the shrub, and the fruit; of the fountain, the river, and the cut
from the river; of the sun, the ray, and the terminating point of the ray. For these illustrations
he professes himself indebted to the Revelations of the Paraclete. In later times, divines have
occasionally resorted to similar illustrations for the purpose of familiarizing the doctrine of
the Trinity to the mind; nor can any danger arise from the proceeding, so long as we recollect
that they are illustrations, not arguments—that we must not draw conclusions from them,
or think that whatever may be truly predicated of the illustrations, may be predicated with
equal truth of that which it was designed to illustrate.”</p>
<p>“‘Notwithstanding, however, the intimate union which subsists between the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, we must be careful,’ says Tertullian, ‘to distinguish between their
Persons.’ In his representations of this distinction he sometimes uses expressions which in
after times, when controversy had introduced greater precision of language, were studiously
avoided by the orthodox. Thus he calls the Father the whole substance—the Son a derivation
from or portion of the whole.”8204</p>
<p>“After showing that Tertullian’s opinions were generally coincident with the orthodox
belief of the Christian Church on the great subject of the Trinity in Unity, Bp. Kaye goes on
to say: ‘We are far from meaning to assert that expressions may not occasionally be found
which are capable of a different interpretation, and which were carefully avoided by the orthodox
writers of later times, when the controversies respecting the Trinity had introduced
greater precision of language.’ Pamelius thought it necessary to put the reader on his guard
against certain of these expressions; and Semler has noticed, with a sort of ill-natured industry
(we call it ill-natured industry, because the true mode of ascertaining a writer’s opinions is,
not to fix upon particular expressions, but to take the general tenor of his language), every
passage in the Tract against Praxeas in which there is any appearance of contradiction, or
which will bear a construction favourable to the Arian tenets. Bp. Bull also, who conceives
<note type="footnote">8204 Kaye, pp. 504–596.</note>

<pb n="1408"/>
the language of Tertullian to be explicit and correct on the subject of the pre-existence and
the consubstantiality, admits that he occasionally uses expressions at variance with the coeternity
of Christ. For instance, in the Tract against Hermogenes,8205 we find a passage in
which it is expressly asserted that there was a time when the Son was not. Perhaps, however,
a reference to the peculiar tenets of Hermogenes will enable us to account for this assertion.
That heretic affirmed that matter was eternal, and argued thus: ‘God was always God, and
always Lord; but the word Lord implies the existence of something over which He was Lord.
Unless, therefore, we suppose the eternity of something distinct from God, it is not true that
He was always Lord.’ Tertullian boldly answered, that God was not always Lord; and that
in Scripture we do not find Him called Lord until the work of creation was completed. In
like manner, he contended that the titles of Judge and Father imply the existence of sin, and
of a Son. As, therefore, there was a time when neither sin nor the Son existed, the titles of
Judge and Father were not at that time applicable to God. Tertullian could scarcely mean
to affirm (in direct opposition to his own statements in the Tract against Praxeas) that there
was ever a time when the λόγος, or Ratio, or Sermo Internusdid not exist. But with respect
to Wisdom and the Son (Sophia and Filius) the case is different. Tertullian assigns to both
a beginning of existence: Sophia was created or formed in order to devise the plan of the
universe; and the Son was begotten in order to carry that plan into effect. Bp. Bull appears
to have given an accurate representation of the matter, when he says that, according to our
author, the Reason and Spirit of God, being the substance of the Word and Son, were coeternal
with God; but that the titles of Word and Son were not strictly applicable until the
former had been emitted to arrange, and the latter begotten to execute, the work of creation.
Without, therefore, attempting to explain, much less to defend, all Tertullian’s expressions
and reasonings, we are disposed to acquiesce in the statement given by Bp. Bull of his
opinions (Defence of the Nicene Creed, sec. iii. ch. x. (p. 545 of the Oxford translation)):
‘From all this it is clear how rashly, as usual, Petavius has pronounced that, “so far as relates
to the eternity of the Word, it is manifest that Tertullian did not by any means acknowledge
it.”’ To myself, indeed, and as I suppose to my reader also, after the many clear testimonies
which I have adduced, the very opposite is manifest, unless indeed Petavius played on the
term, the Word, which I will not suppose. For Tertullian does indeed teach that the Son of
God was made and was called the Word (Verbum or Sermo) from some definite beginning,
i.e. at the time when He went out from God the Father with the voice, ‘Let there be light’ in
order to arrange the universe. But, for all that, that he really believed that the very hypostasis
which is called the Word and Son of God is eternal, I have, I think, abundantly demonstrated.”
(The whole of Bp. Bull’s remark is worth considering; it occurs in the translation
just referred to, pp. 508–545.)—(Pp. 521–525.)</p>
<note type="footnote">8205 Ch. iii. compared with ch. xviii.</note>

<pb n="1409"/>
<p>“In speaking also of the Holy Ghost, Tertullian occasionally uses terms of a very ambiguous
and equivocal character. He says, for instance (Adversus Praxean, c. xii.), that in Gen.
i. 26, God addressed the Son, His Word (the Second Person in the Trinity), and the Spirit
in the Word (the Third Person of the Trinity). Here the distinct personality of the Spirit is
expressly asserted; although it is difficult to reconcile Tertullian’s words, ‘Spiritus in Sermone,’
with the assertion. It is, however, certain both from the general tenor of the Tract against
Praxeas, and from many passages in his other writings (for instance, Ad Martyras, iii.), that
the distinct personality of the Holy Ghost formed an article of Tertullian’s creed. The occasional
ambiguity of his language respecting the Holy Ghost is perhaps in part to be traced
to the variety of senses in which the term ‘Spiritus’ is used. It is applied generally to God,
for ‘God is a Spirit’ (Adv. Marcionem, ii. 9); and for the same reason to the Son, who is frequently
called ‘the Spirit of God,’ and ‘the Spirit of the Creator’ (De Oratione, i.; Adv. Praxean,
xiv., xxvi.; Adv. Marcionem, v. 8; Apolog. xxiii.; Adv. Marcionem, iii. 6, iv. 33). Bp. Bull likewise
(Defence of the Nicene Creed, i. 2), following Grotius, has shown that the word ‘Spiritus’ is
employed by the fathers to express the divine nature in Christ.”—(Pp. 525, 526.)</p>

 <p>II.
(The bishop of Rome, cap. i. p. 597.)</p>
<p>Probably Victor (a.d. 190), who is elsewhere called Victorinus, as Oehler conjectures,
by a blunderer who tacked the inus to his name, because he was thinking of Zephyrinus, his
immediate successor. This Victor “acknowledged the prophetic gifts of Montanus,” and
kept up communion with the Phrygian churches that adopted them: but worse than that,
he now seems to have patronized the Patri-passion heresy, under the compulsion of Praxeas.
So Tertullian says, who certainly had no idea that the Bishop of Rome was the infallible
judge of controversies, when he recorded the facts of this strange history. Thus, we find the
very founder of “Latin Christianity,” accusing a contemporary Bishop of Rome of heresy
and the patronage of heresy, in two particulars. Our earliest acquaintance with that See
presents us with Polycarp’s superior authority, at Rome itself, in maintaining apostolic
doctrine and suppressing heresy. “He it was, who coming to Rome,” says Irenæus,8206 “in
the time of Anicetus, caused many to turn away from the aforesaid heretics (viz. Valentinus
and Marcion) to the Church of God, proclaiming that he had received this one and sole truth
from the Apostles.” Anicetus was a pious prelate who never dreamed of asserting a superior
claim as the chief depositary of Apostolic orthodoxy, and whose beautiful example in the
Easter-questions discussed between Polycarp and himself, is another illustration of the independence
of the sister churches, at that period.8207 Nor is it unworthy to be noted, that

<note type="footnote">8207 Vol. I. p. 569, this Series.</note>

<pb n="1410"/>
the next event, in Western history, establishes a like principle against that other and less
worthy occupant of the Roman See, of whom we have spoken. Irenæus rebukes Victor for
his dogmatism about Easter, and reproaches him with departing from the example of his
predecessors in the same See.8208 With Eleutherus he had previously remonstrated, though
mildly, for his toleration of heresy and his patronage of the raising schism of Montanus.8209</p>

<p>Porson having spoken Pontifically upon the matter of the text of “the Three Witnesses,”
cadit quæstio, locutus est Augur Apollo. It is of more importance that Bishop Kaye in his
calm wisdom, remarks as follows;8210 “In my opinion, the passage in Tertullian, far from
containing an allusion to 1 John v. 7, furnishes most decisive proof that he knew nothing
of the verse.” After this, and the acquiescence of scholars generally, it would be presumption
to say a word on the question of quoting it as Scripture. In Textual Criticism it seems to be
an established canon that it has no place in the Greek Testament. I submit, however, that,
something remains to be said for it, on the ground of the old African Version used and
quoted by Tertullian and Cyprian; and I dare to say, that, while there would be no ground
whatever for inserting it in our English Version, the question of striking it out is a widely
different one. It would be sacrilege, in my humble opinion, for reasons which will appear,
in the following remarks, upon our author.</p>
<p>It appears to me very clear that Tertullian is quoting 1 John v. 7 in the passage now
under consideration: “Qui tres unum sunt, non unus, quomodo dictum est, Ego et Pater
unum sumus, etc.” Let me refer to a work containing a sufficient answer to Porson, on this
point of Tertullian’s quotation, which it is easier to pass sub-silentio, than to refute. I mean
Forster’s New Plea, of which the full title is placed in the margin.8211 The whole work is
worth thoughtful study, but, I name it with reference to this important passage of our author,
exclusively. In connection with other considerations on which I have no right to enlarge in
this place, it satisfies me as to the primitive origin of the text in the Vulgate, and hence of
its right to stand in our English Vulgate until it can be shewn that the Septuagint Version,

quoted and honoured by our Lord, is free from similar readings, and divergences from the
Hebrew mss.</p>
<p>Stated as a mere question as to the early African Church,8212 the various versions known
as the Itala, and the right of the Latin and English Vulgates to remain as they are, the whole
question is a fresh one. Let me be pardoned for saying: (1) that I am not pleading for it as a
proof-text of the Trinity, having never once quoted it as such in a long ministry, during
which I have preached nearly a hundred Trinity-Sunday Sermons; (2) that I consider it as
practically Apocryphal, and hence as coming under St. Jerome’s law, and being useless to
establish doctrine; and (3) that I feel no need of it, owing to the wealth of Scripture on the
same subject. Tertullian, himself says that he cites “only a few out of many texts—not pretending
to bring up all the passages of Scripture…having produced an accumulation of
witnesses in the fulness of their dignity and authority.”</p>
<p>To those interested in the question let me commend the learned dissertation of Grabe
on the textual case, as it stood in his day.8213 I value it chiefly because it proves that the
Greek Testament, elsewhere says, disjointedly, what is collected into 1 John v. 7. It is,
therefore, Holy Scripture in substance, if not in the letter. What seems to me importan
however, is the balance it gives to the whole context, and the defective character of the
grammar and logic, if it be stricken out. In the Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate of the Old
Testament we have a precisely similar case. Refer to Psa. xiii., alike in the Latin and the
Greek, as compared with our English Version.8214 Between the third and fourth verses,
three whole verses are interpolated: Shall we strike them out? Of course, if certain critics
are to prevail over St. Paul, for he quotes them (Rom. iii. 10) with the formula: “As it is
written.” Now, then, till we expurgate the English Version of the Epistle to the Romans,—or
rather the original of St. Paul himself, I employ Grabe’s argument only to prove my point,
which is this, viz., that 1 John v. 7 being Scripture, ought to be left untouched in the Versions
where it stands, although it be no part of the Greek Testament.</p>

Scorpiace.</head>
<p>Antidote for the Scorpion’s Sting.8215</p>
<p>[Translated by Rev. S. Thelwall.]</p>

 <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>Chapter I.</head>
<p>The earth brings forth, as if by suppuration, great evil from the diminutive scorpion.
The poisons are as many as are the kinds of it, the disasters as many as are also the species
of it, the pains as many as are also the colours of it. Nicander writes on the subject of scorpions,
and depicts them. And yet to smite with the tail—which tail will be whatever is prolonged
from the hindmost part of the body, and scourges—is the one movement which they all use
when making an assault. Wherefore that succession of knots in the scorpion, which in the
inside is a thin poisoned veinlet, rising up with a bow-like bound, draws tight a barbed sting
at the end, after the manner of an engine for shooting missiles. From which circumstance
they also call after the scorpion, the warlike implement which, by its being drawn back, gives
an impetus to the arrows. The point in their case is also a duct of extreme minuteness, to
inflict the wound; and where it penetrates, it pours out poison. The usual time of danger is
the summer season: fierceness hoists the sail when the wind is from the south and the southwest.
Among cures, certain substances supplied by nature have very great efficacy; magic
also puts on some bandage; the art of healing counteracts with lancet and cup. For some,
making haste, take also beforehand a protecting draught; but sexual intercourse drains it
off, and they are dry again. We have faith for a defence, if we are not smitten with distrust
itself also, in immediately making the sign8216 and adjuring,8217 and besmearing the heel
with the beast. Finally, we often aid in this way even the heathen, seeing we have been endowed
by God with that power which the apostle first used when he despised the viper’s
bite.8218 What, then, does this pen of yours offer, if faith is safe by what it has of its own?

That it may be safe by what it has of its own also at other times, when it is subjected to
scorpions of its own. These, too, have a troublesome littleness, and are of different sorts,
and are armed in one manner, and are stirred up at a definite time, and that not another
than one of burning heat. This among Christians is a season of persecution. When, therefore,
faith is greatly agitated, and the Church burning, as represented by the bush,8219 then the
Gnostics break out, then the Valentinians creep forth, then all the opponents of martyrdom
bubble up, being themselves also hot to strike, penetrate, kill. For, because they know that
many are artless and also inexperienced, and weak moreover, that a very great number in
truth are Christians who veer about with the wind and conform to its moods, they perceive
that they are never to be approached more than when fear has opened the entrances to the
soul, especially when some display of ferocity has already arrayed with a crown the faith of
martyrs. Therefore, drawing along the tail hitherto, they first of all apply it to the feelings,
or whip with it as if on empty space. Innocent persons undergo such suffering. So that you
may suppose the speaker to be a brother or a heathen of the better sort. A sect troublesome
to nobody so dealt with! Then they pierce. Men are perishing without a reason. For that
they are perishing, and without a reason, is the first insertion. Then they now strike mortally.
But the unsophisticated souls8220 know not what is written, and what meaning it bears,
where and when and before whom we must confess, or ought, save that this, to die for God,
is, since He preserves me, not even artlessness, but folly, nay madness. If He kills me, how
will it be His duty to preserve me? Once for all Christ died for us, once for all He was slain
that we might not be slain. If He demands the like from me in return, does He also look for
salvation from my death by violence? Or does God importune for the blood of men, especially
if He refuses that of bulls and he-goats?8221 Assuredly He had rather have the repentance
than the death of the sinner.8222 And how is He eager for the death of those who are not
sinners? Whom will not these, and perhaps other subtle devices containing heretical poisons,
pierce either for doubt if not for destruction, or for irritation if not for death? As for you,
therefore, do you, if faith is on the alert, smite on the spot the scorpion with a curse, so far
as you can, with your sandal, and leave it dying in its own stupefaction? But if it gluts the
wound, it drives the poison inwards, and makes it hasten into the bowels; forthwith all the
former senses become dull, the blood of the mind freezes, the flesh of the spirit pines away,
loathing for the Christian name is accompanied by a sense of sourness. Already the understanding
also seeks for itself a place where it may throw up; and thus, once for all, the
weakness with which it has been smitten breathes out wounded faith either in heresy or in

heathenism. And now the present state of matters is such, that we are in the midst of an intense
heat, the very dog-star of persecution,—a state originating doubtless with the dogheaded
one himself.8223 Of some Christians the fire, of others the sword, of others the beasts,
have made trial; others are hungering in prison for the martyrdoms of which they have had
a taste in the meantime by being subjected to clubs and claws8224 besides. We ourselves,
having been appointed for pursuit, are like hares being hemmed in from a distance; and
heretics go about according to their wont. Therefore the state of the times has prompted
me to prepare by my pen, in opposition to the little beasts which trouble our sect, our antidote
against poison, that I may thereby effect cures. You who read will at the same time drink.
Nor is the draught bitter. If the utterances of the Lord are sweeter than honey and the honeycombs,
8225 the juices are from that source. If the promise of God flows with milk and
honey,8226 the ingredients which go to make that draught have the smack of this. “But woe
to them who turn sweet into bitter, and light into darkness.”8227 For, in like manner, they
also who oppose martyrdoms, representing salvation to be destruction, transmute sweet
into bitter, as well as light into darkness; and thus, by preferring this very wretched life to
that most blessed one, they put bitter for sweet, as well as darkness for light.</p>

<p>But not yet about the good to be got from martyrdom must we learn, without our having
first heard about the duty of suffering it; nor must we learn the usefulness of it, before we
have heard about the necessity for it. The (question of the) divine warrant goes
first—whether God has willed and also commanded ought of the kind, so that they who
assert that it is not good are not plied with arguments for thinking it profitable save when
they have been subdued.8228 It is proper that heretics be driven8229 to duty, not enticed.
Obstinacy must be conquered, not coaxed. And, certainly, that will be pronounced beforehand
quite good enough, which will be shown to have been instituted and also enjoined by
God. Let the Gospels wait a little, while I set forth their root the Law, while I ascertain the
will of God from those writings from which I recall to mind Himself also: “I am,” says He,
“God, thy God, who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt. Thou shalt have no other
gods besides me. Thou shalt not make unto thee a likeness of those things which are in
heaven, and which are in the earth beneath, and which are in the sea under the earth. Thou
shalt not worship them, nor serve them. For I am the Lord thy God.”8230 Likewise in the
same book of Exodus: “Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. Ye
shall not make unto you gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.”8231
To the following effect also, in Deuteronomy: “Hear, O Israel; The Lord thy God is one: and
thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and all thy might, and with all thy
soul.”8232 And again: “Neither do thou forget the Lord thy God, who brought thee forth
from the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and
serve Him only, and cleave to Him, and swear by His name. Ye shall not go after strange
gods, and the gods of the nations which are round about you, because the Lord thy God is
also a jealous God among you, and lest His anger should be kindled against thee, and destroy
thee from off the face of the earth.”8233 But setting before them blessings and curses, He
also says: “Blessings shall be yours, if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God,
whatsoever I command you this day, and do not wander from the way which I have commanded
you, to go and serve other gods whom ye know not.”8234 And as to rooting them
out in every way: “Ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations, which ye shall
possess by inheritance, served their gods, upon mountains and hills, and under shady trees.

Ye shall overthrow all their altars, ye shall overturn and break in pieces their pillars, and cut
down their groves, and burn with fire the graven images of the gods themselves, and destroy
the names of them out of that place.”8235 He further urges, when they (the Israelites) had
entered the land of promise, and driven out its nations: “Take heed to thy self, that thou do
not follow them after they be driven out from before thee, that thou do not inquire after
their gods, saying, As the nations serve their gods, so let me do likewise.”8236 But also says
He: “If there arise among you a prophet himself, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a
sign or a wonder, and it come to pass, and he say, Let us go and serve other gods, whom ye
know not, do not hearken to the words of that prophet or dreamer, for the Lord your God
proveth you, to know whether ye fear God with all your heart and with all your soul. After
the Lord your God ye shall go, and fear Him, and keep His commandments, and obey His
voice, and serve Him, and cleave unto Him. But that prophet or dreamer shall die; for he
has spoken to turn thee away from the Lord thy God.”8237 But also in another section,8238
“If, however, thy brother, the son of thy father or of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter,
or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend who is as thine own soul, solicit thee, saying secretly,
Let us go and serve other gods, which thou knowest not, nor did thy fathers, of the gods of
the nations which are round about thee, very nigh unto thee or far off from thee, do not
consent to go with him, and do not hearken to him. Thine eye shall not spare him, neither
shalt thou pity, neither shalt thou preserve him; thou shalt certainly inform upon him.
Thine hand shall be first upon him to kill him, and afterwards the hand of thy people; and
ye shall stone him, and he shall die, seeing he has sought to turn thee away from the Lord
thy God.”8239 He adds likewise concerning cities, that if it appeared that one of these had,
through the advice of unrighteous men, passed over to other gods, all its inhabitants should
be slain, and everything belonging to it become accursed, and all the spoil of it be gathered
together into all its places of egress, and be, even with all the people, burned with fire in all
its streets in the sight of the Lord God; and, says He, “it shall not be for dwelling in for ever:
it shall not be built again any more, and there shall cleave to thy hands nought of its accursed
plunder, that the Lord may turn from the fierceness of His anger.”8240 He has, from His
abhorrence of idols, framed a series of curses too: “Cursed be the man who maketh a graven
or a molten image, an abomination, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth it
in a secret place.”8241 But in Leviticus He says: “Go not ye after idols, nor make to yourselves

molten gods: I am the Lord your God.”8242 And in other passages: “The children of Israel
are my household servants; these are they whom I led forth from the land of Egypt:8243 I
am the Lord your God. Ye shall not make you idols fashioned by the hand, neither rear you
up a graven image. Nor shall ye set up a remarkable stone in your land (to worship it): I
am the Lord your God.”8244 These words indeed were first spoken by the Lord by the lips
of Moses, being applicable certainly to whomsoever the Lord God of Israel may lead forth
in like manner from the Egypt of a most superstitious world, and from the abode of human
slavery. But from the mouth of every prophet in succession, sound forth also utterances of
the same God, augmenting the same law of His by a renewal of the same commands, and
in the first place announcing no other duty in so special a manner as the being on guard
against all making and worshipping of idols; as when by the mouth of David He says: “The
gods of the nations are silver and gold: they have eyes, and see not; they have ears, and hear
not; they have a nose, and smell not; a mouth, and they speak not; hands, and they handle
not; feet and they walk not. Like to them shall be they who make them, and trust in them.”8245</p>

<p>Nor should I think it needful to discuss whether God pursues a worthy course in forbidding
His own name and honour to be given over to a lie, or does so in not consenting that
such as He has plucked from the maze of false religion should return again to Egypt, or does
so in not suffering to depart from Him them whom He has chosen for Himself. Thus that,
too, will not require to be treated by us, whether He has wished to be kept the rule which
He has chosen to appoint, and whether He justly avenges the abandonment of the rule which
He has wished to be kept; since He would have appointed it to no purpose if He had not
wished it kept, and would have to no purpose wished it kept if He had been unwilling to
uphold it. My next step, indeed, is to put to the test these appointments of God in opposition
to false religions, the completely vanquished as well as also the punished, since on these will
depend the entire argument for martyrdoms. Moses was apart with God on the mountain,
when the people, not brooking his absence, which was so needful, seek to make gods for
themselves, which, for his own part, he will prefer to destroy.8246 Aaron is importuned, and
commands that the earrings of their women be brought together, that they may be thrown
into the fire. For the people were about to lose, as a judgment upon themselves, the true
ornaments for the ears, the words of God. The wise fire makes for them the molten likeness
of a calf, reproaching them with having the heart where they have their treasure also,—in
Egypt, to wit, which clothed with sacredness, among the other animals, a certain ox likewise.
Therefore the slaughter of three thousand by their nearest relatives, because they had displeased
their so very near relative God, solemnly marked both the commencement and the
deserts of the trespass. Israel having, as we are told in Numbers,8247 turned aside at Sethim,
the people go to the daughters of Moab to gratify their lust: they are allured to the idols, so
that they committed whoredom with the spirit also: finally, they eat of their defiled sacrifices;
then they both worship the gods of the nation, and are admitted to the rites of Beelphegor.
For this lapse, too, into idolatry, sister to adultery, it took the slaughter of twenty-three
thousand by the swords of their countrymen to appease the divine anger. After the death
of Joshua the son of Nave they forsake the God of their fathers, and serve idols, Baalim and
Ashtaroth;8248 and the Lord in anger delivered them up to the hands of spoilers, and they
continued to be spoiled by them, and to be sold to their adversaries, and could not at all
stand before their enemies. Whithersoever they went forth, His hand was upon them for
evil, and they were greatly distressed. And after this God sets judges (critas), the same as
our censors, over them. But not even these did they continue steadfastly to obey. So soon
as one of the judges died, they proceeded to transgress more than their fathers had done by
<note type="footnote">8246 Ex. xxxii.</note>

<note type="footnote">8248 Judg. ii. 8–13.</note>

<pb n="1419"/>
going after the gods of others, and serving and worshipping them. Therefore the Lord was
angry. “Since, indeed,” He says, “this nation have transgressed my covenant which I established
with their fathers, and have not hearkened to my voice, I also will give no heed to
remove from before them a man of the nations which Joshua left at his death.”8249 And
thus, throughout almost all the annals of the judges and of the kings who succeeded them,
while the strength of the surrounding nations was preserved, He meted wrath out to Israel
by war and captivity and a foreign yoke, as often as they turned aside from Him, especially
to idolatry.</p>

<p>If, therefore, it is evident that from the beginning this kind of worship has both been
forbidden—witness the commands so numerous and weighty—and that it has never been
engaged in without punishment following, as examples so numerous and impressive show,
and that no offence is counted by God so presumptuous as a trespass of this sort, we ought
further to perceive the purport of both the divine threatenings and their fulfilments, which
was even then commended not only by the not calling in question, but also by the enduring
of martyrdoms, for which certainly He had given occasion by forbidding idolatry. For
otherwise martyrdoms would not take place. And certainly He had supplied, as a warrant
for these, His own authority, willing those events to come to pass for the occurrence of
which He had given occasion. At present (it is important), for we are getting severely stung
concerning the will of God, and the scorpion repeats the prick, denying the existence of this
will, finding fault with it, so that he either insinuates that there is another god, such that
this is not his will, or none the less overthrows ours, seeing such is his will, or altogether
denies this will of God, if he cannot deny Himself. But, for our part, contending elsewhere
about God, and about all the rest of the body of heretical teaching, we now draw before us
definite lines8250 for one form of encounter, maintaining that this will, such as to have given
occasion for martyrdoms, is that of not another god than the God of Israel, on the ground
of the commandments relating to an always forbidden, as well as of the judgments upon a
punished, idolatry. For if the keeping of a command involves the suffering of violence, this
will be, so to speak, a command about keeping the command, requiring me to suffer that
through which I shall be able to keep the command, violence namely, whatever of it threatens
me when on my guard against idolatry. And certainly (in the case supposed) the Author of
the command extorts compliance with it. He could not, therefore, have been unwilling that
those events should come to pass by means of which the compliance will be manifest. The
injunction is given me not to make mention of any other god, not even by speaking,—as
little by the tongue as by the hand,—to fashion a god, and not to worship or in any way
show reverence to another than Him only who thus commands me, whom I am both bid
fear that I may not be forsaken by Him, and love with my whole being, that I may die for
Him. Serving as a soldier under this oath, I am challenged by the enemy. If I surrender to
them, I am as they are. In maintaining this oath, I fight furiously in battle, am wounded,
hewn in pieces, slain. Who wished this fatal issue to his soldier, but he who sealed him by
such an oath?</p>

<p>You have therefore the will of my God. We have cured this prick. Let us give good heed
to another thrust touching the character of His will. It would be tedious to show that my
God is good,—a truth with which the Marcionites have now been made acquainted by us.
Meanwhile it is enough that He is called God for its being necessary that He should be believed
to be good. For if any one make the supposition that God is evil, he will not be able
to take his stand on both the constituents thereof: he will be bound either to affirm that he
whom he has thought to be evil is not God, or that he whom he has proclaimed to be God
is good. Good, therefore, will be the will also of him who, unless he is good, will not be God.
The goodness of the thing itself also which God has willed—of martyrdom, I mean—will
show this, because only one who is good has willed what is good. I stoutly maintain that
martyrdom is good, as required by the God by whom likewise idolatry is forbidden and
punished. For martyrdom strives against and opposes idolatry. But to strive against and
oppose evil cannot be ought but good. Not as if I denied that there is a rivalry in evil things
with one another, as well as in good also; but this ground for it requires a different state of
matters. For martyrdom contends with idolatry, not from some malice which they share,
but from its own kindness; for it delivers from idolatry. Who will not proclaim that to be
good which delivers from idolatry? What else is the opposition between idolatry and martyrdom,
than that between life and death? Life will be counted to be martyrdom as much
as idolatry to be death. He who will call life an evil, has death to speak of as a good. This
frowardness also appertains to men,—to discard what is wholesome, to accept what is
baleful, to avoid all dangerous cures, or, in short, to be eager to die rather than to be healed.
For they are many who flee from the aid of physic also, many in folly, many from fear and
false modesty. And the healing art has manifestly an apparent cruelty, by reason of the lancet,
and of the burning iron, and of the great heat of the mustard; yet to be cut and burned, and
pulled and bitten, is not on that account an evil, for it occasions helpful pains; nor will it be
refused merely because it afflicts, but because it afflicts inevitably will it be applied. The
good accruing is the apology for the frightfulness of the work. In short, that man who is
howling and groaning and bellowing in the hands of a physician will presently load the same
hands with a fee, and proclaim that they are the best operators, and no longer affirm that
they are cruel. Thus martyrdoms also rage furiously, but for salvation. God also will be at
liberty to heal for everlasting life by means of fires and swords, and all that is painful. But
you will admire the physician at least even in that respect, that for the most part he employs
like properties in the cures to counteract the properties of the diseases, when he aids, as it
were, the wrong way, succouring by means of those things to which the affliction is owing.
For he both checks heat by heat, by laying on a greater load; and subdues inflammation by

<pb n="1412"/>
leaving thirst unappeased, by tormenting rather; and contracts the superabundance of bile
by every bitter little draught, and stops hemorrhage by opening a veinlet in addition. But
you will think that God must be found fault with, and that for being jealous, if He has chosen
to contend with a disease and to do good by imitating the malady, to destroy death by death,
to dissipate killing by killing, to dispel tortures by tortures, to disperse8251 punishments by
punishments, to bestow life by withdrawing it, to aid the flesh by injuring it, to preserve the
soul by snatching it away. The wrongheadedness, as you deem it to be, is reasonableness;
what you count cruelty is kindness. Thus, seeing God by brief (sufferings) effects cures for
eternity, extol your God for your prosperity; you have fallen into His hands, but have happily
fallen. He also fell into your sicknesses. Man always first provides employment for the
physician; in short, he has brought upon himself the danger of death. He had received from
his own Lord, as from a physician, the salutary enough rule to live according to the law, that
he should eat of all indeed (that the garden produced) and should refrain from only one
little tree which in the meantime the Physician Himself knew as a perilous one. He gave ear
to him whom he preferred, and broke through self-restraint. He ate what was forbidden,
and, surfeited by the trespass, suffered indigestion tending to death; he certainly richly deserving
to lose his life altogether who wished to do so. But the inflamed tumour due to the
trespass having been endured until in due time the medicine might be mixed, the Lord
gradually prepared the means of healing—all the rules of faith, they also bearing a resemblance
to (the causes of) the ailment, seeing they annul the word of death by the word of life,
and diminish the trespass-listening by a listening of allegiance. Thus, even when that Physician
commands one to die, He drives out the lethargy of death. Why does man show reluctance
to suffer now from a cure, what he was not reluctant then to suffer from a disorder?
Does he dislike being killed for salvation, who did not dislike being killed for destruction?—
Will he feel squeamish with reference to the counter poison, who gaped for the
poison?</p>

<p>But if, for the contest’s sake, God had appointed martyrdoms for us, that thereby we
might make trial with our opponent, in order that He may now keep bruising him by whom
man chose to be bruised, here too generosity rather than harshness in God holds sway. For
He wished to make man, now plucked from the devil’s throat by faith, trample upon him
likewise by courage, that he might not merely have escaped from, but also completely vanquished,
his enemy. He who had called to salvation has been pleased to summon to glory
also, that they who were rejoicing in consequence of their deliverance may be in transports
when they are crowned likewise. With what good-will the world celebrates those games, the
combative festivals and superstitious contests of the Greeks, involving forms both of worship
and of pleasure, has now become clear in Africa also. As yet cities, by sending their congratulations
severally, annoy Carthage, which was presented with the Pythian game after the
racecourse had attained to an old age. Thus, by the world8252 it has been believed to be a
most proper mode of testing proficiency in studies, to put in competition the forms of skill,
to elicit the existing condition of bodies and of voices, the reward being the informer, the
public exhibition the judge, and pleasure the decision. Where there are mere contests, there
are some wounds: fists make reel, heels kick like butting rams, boxing-gloves mangle, whips
leave gashes. Yet there will be no one reproaching the superintendent of the contest for exposing
men to outrage. Suits for injuries lie outside the racecourse. But to the extent that
those persons deal in discoloration, and gore, and swellings, he will design for them crowns,
doubtless, and glory, and a present, political privileges, contributions by the citizens, images,
statues, and—of such sort as the world can give—an eternity of fame, a resurrection by being
kept in remembrance. The pugilist himself does not complain of feeling pain, for he wishes
it; the crown closes the wounds, the palm hides the blood: he is excited more by victory than
by injury. Will you count this man hurt whom you see happy? But not even the vanquished
himself will reproach the superintendent of the contest for his misfortune. Shall it be unbecoming
in God to bring forth kinds of skill and rules of His own into public view, into this
open ground of the world, to be seen by men, and angels, and all powers?—to test flesh and
spirit as to stedfastness and endurance?—to give to this one the palm, to this one distinction,
to that one the privilege of citizenship, to that one pay?—to reject some also, and after
punishing to remove them with disgrace? You dictate to God, forsooth, the times, or the
ways, or the places in which to institute a trial concerning His own troop (of competitors)
as if it were not proper for the Judge to pronounce the preliminary decision also. Well now,
if He had put forth faith to suffer martyrdoms not for the contest’s sake, but for its own
benefit, ought it not to have had some store of hope, for the increase of which it might restrain
desire of its own, and check its wish in order that it might strive to mount up, seeing they
<note type="footnote">8252 Literally, “age.”—Tr.</note>

<pb n="1424"/>
also who discharge earthly functions are eager for promotion? Or how will there be many
mansions in our Father’s house, if not to accord with a diversity of deserts? How will one
star also differ from another star in glory, unless in virtue of disparity in their rays?8253 But
further, if, on that account, some increase of brightness also was appropriate to loftiness of
faith, that gain ought to have been of some such sort as would cost great effort, poignant
suffering, torture, death. But consider the requital, when flesh and life are paid away—than
which in man there is nought more precious, the one from the hand of God, the other from
His breath—that the very things are paid away in obtaining the benefit of which the benefit
consists; that the very things are expended which may be acquired; that the same things are
the price which are also the commodities. God had foreseen also other weaknesses incident
to the condition of man,—the stratagems of the enemy, the deceptive aspects of the creatures,
the snares of the world; that faith, even after baptism, would be endangered; that the most,
after attaining unto salvation, would be lost again, through soiling the wedding-dress,
through failing to provide oil for their torchlets—would be such as would have to be sought
for over mountains and woodlands, and carried back upon the shoulders. He therefore appointed
as second supplies of comfort, and the last means of succour, the fight of martyrdom
and the baptism—thereafter free from danger—of blood. And concerning the happiness
of the man who has partaken of these, David says: “Blessed are they whose iniquities are
forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute
sin.”8254 For, strictly speaking, there cannot any longer be reckoned ought against the
martyrs, by whom in the baptism (of blood) life itself is laid down. Thus, “love covers the
multitude of sins;”8255 and loving God, to wit, with all its strength (by which in the endurance
of martyrdom it maintains the fight), with all its life8256 (which it lays down for God), it
makes of man a martyr. Shall you call these cures, counsels, methods of judging, spectacles,
(illustrations of) even the barbarity of God? Does God covet man’s blood? And yet I might
venture to affirm that He does, if man also covets the kingdom of heaven, if man covets a
sure salvation, if man also covets a second new birth. The exchange is displeasing to no one,
which can plead, in justification of itself, that either benefit or injury is shared by the parties
making it.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.</head>
<p>If the scorpion, swinging his tail in the air, still reproach us with having a murderer for
our God, I shall shudder at the altogether foul breath of blasphemy which comes stinking
from his heretical mouth; but I will embrace even such a God, with assurance derived from
reason, by which reason even He Himself has, in the person of His own Wisdom, by the
lips of Solomon, proclaimed Himself to be more than a murderer: Wisdom (Sophia), says
He has slain her own children.8257 Sophia is Wisdom. She has certainly slain them wisely
if only into life, and reasonably if only into glory. Of murder by a parent, oh the clever form!
Oh the dexterity of crime! Oh the proof of cruelty, which has slain for this reason, that he
whom it may have slain may not die! And therefore what follows? Wisdom is praised in
hymns, in the places of egress; for the death of martyrs also is praised in song. Wisdom behaves
with firmness in the streets, for with good results does she murder her own sons.8258
Nay, on the top of the walls she speaks with assurance, when indeed, according to Esaias,
this one calls out, “I am God’s;” and this one shouts, “In the name of Jacob;” and another
writes, “In the name of Israel.”8259 O good mother! I myself also wish to be put among the
number of her sons, that I may be slain by her; I wish to be slain, that I may become a son.
But does she merely murder her sons, or also torture them? For I hear God also, in another
passage, say, “I will burn them as gold is burned, and will try them as silver is tried.”8260
Certainly by the means of torture which fires and punishments supply, by the testing martyrdoms
of faith. The apostle also knows what kind of God he has ascribed to us, when he
writes: “If God spared not His own Son, but gave Him up for us, how did He not with Him
also give us all things?”8261 You see how divine Wisdom has murdered even her own
proper, first-born and only Son, who is certainly about to live, nay, to bring back the others
also into life. I can say with the Wisdom of God; It is Christ who gave Himself up for our
offences.8262 Already has Wisdom butchered herself also. The character of words depends
not on the sound only, but on the meaning also, and they must be heard not merely by ears,
but also by minds. He who does not understand, believes God to be cruel; although for him
also who does not understand, an announcement has been made to restrain his harshness
in understanding otherwise than aright. “For who,” says the apostle, “has known the mind
of the Lord? or who has been His counsellor, to teach Him? or who has pointed out to Him

the way of understanding?”8263 But, indeed, the world has held it lawful for Diana of the
Scythians, or Mercury of the Gauls, or Saturn of the Africans, to be appeased by human
sacrifices; and in Latium to this day Jupiter has human blood given him to taste in the midst
of the city; and no one makes it a matter of discussion, or imagines that it does not occur
for some reason, or that it occurs by the will of his God, without having value. If our God,
too, to have a sacrifice of His own, had required martyrdoms for Himself, who would have
reproached Him for the deadly religion, and the mournful ceremonies, and the altar-pyre,
and the undertaker-priest, and not rather have counted happy the man whom God should
have devoured?</p>

<p>We keep therefore the one position, and, in respect of this question only, summon to
an encounter, whether martyrdoms have been commanded by God, that you may believe
that they have been commanded by reason, if you know that they have been commanded
by Him, because God will not command ought without reason. Since the death of His own
saints is precious is His sight, as David sings,8264 it is not, I think, that one which falls to
the lot of men generally, and is a debt due by all (rather is that one even disgraceful on account
of the trespass, and the desert of condemnation to which it is to be traced), but that
other which is met in this very work—in bearing witness for religion, and maintaining the
fight of confession in behalf of righteousness and the sacrament. As saith Esaias, “See how
the righteous man perisheth, and no one layeth it to heart; and righteous men are taken
away, and no one considereth it: for from before the face of unrighteousness the righteous
man perisheth, and he shall have honour at his burial.”8265 Here, too, you have both an
announcement of martyrdoms, and of the recompense they bring. From the beginning, indeed,
righteousness suffers violence. Forthwith, as soon as God has begun to be worshipped,
religion has got ill-will for her portion. He who had pleased God is slain, and that by his
brother. Beginning with kindred blood, in order that it might the more easily go in quest
of that of strangers, ungodliness made the object of its pursuit, finally, that not only of
righteous persons, but even of prophets also. David is persecuted; Elias put to flight;
Jeremias stoned; Esaias cut asunder; Zacharias butchered between the altar and the temple,
imparting to the hard stones lasting marks of his blood.8266 That person himself, at the close
of the law and the prophets, and called not a prophet, but a messenger, is, suffering an ignominious
death, beheaded to reward a dancing-girl. And certainly they who were wont to be
led by the Spirit of God used to be guided by Himself to martyrdoms; so that they had even
already to endure what they had also proclaimed as requiring to be borne. Wherefore the
brotherhood of the three also, when the dedication of the royal image was the occasion of
the citizens being pressed to offer worship, knew well what faith, which alone in them had
not been taken captive, required,—namely, that they must resist idolatry to the death.8267
For they remembered also the words of Jeremias writing to those over whom that captivity
was impending: “And now ye shall see borne upon (men’s) shoulders the gods of the Babylonians,
of gold and silver and wood, causing fear to the Gentiles. Beware, therefore, that
ye also do not be altogether like the foreigners, and be seized with fear while ye behold
crowds worshipping those gods before and behind, but say in your mind, Our duty is to

worship Thee, O Lord.”8268 Therefore, having got confidence from God, they said, when
with strength of mind they set at defiance the king’s threats against the disobedient: “There
is no necessity for our making answer to this command of yours. For our God whom we
worship is able to deliver us from the furnace of fire and from your hands; and then it will
be made plain to you that we shall neither serve your idol, nor worship your golden image
which you have set up.”8269 O martyrdom even without suffering perfect! Enough did they
suffer! enough were they burned, whom on this account God shielded, that it might not
seem that they had given a false representation of His power. For forthwith, certainly, would
the lions, with their pent-up and wonted savageness, have devoured Daniel also, a worshipper
of none but God, and therefore accused and demanded by the Chaldeans, if it had been
right that the worthy anticipation of Darius concerning God should have proved delusive.
For the rest, every preacher of God, and every worshipper also, such as, having been
summoned to the service of idolatry, had refused compliance, ought to have suffered,
agreeably to the tenor of that argument too, by which the truth ought to have been recommended
both to those who were then living and to those following in succession,—(namely),
that the suffering of its defenders themselves bespeak trust for it, because nobody would
have been willing to be slain but one possessing the truth. Such commands as well as instances,
remounting to earliest times, show that believers are under obligation to suffer
martyrdom.</p>

<p>It remains for us, lest ancient times may perhaps have had the sacrament8270 (exclusively)
their own, to review the modern Christian system, as though, being also from God, it might
be different from what preceded, and besides, therefore, opposed thereto in its code of rules
likewise, so that its Wisdom knows not to murder her own sons! Evidently, in the case of
Christ both the divine nature and the will and the sect are different from any previously
known! He will have commanded either no martyrdoms at all, or those which must be understood
in a sense different from the ordinary, being such a person as to urge no one to a
risk of this kind as to promise no reward to them who suffer for Him, because He does not
wish them to suffer; and therefore does He say, when setting forth His chief commands,
“Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven.”8271 The following statement, indeed, applies first to all without restriction, then
specially to the apostles themselves: “Blessed shall ye be when men shall revile you, and
persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you, for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding
glad, since very great is your reward in heaven; for so used their fathers to do even
to the prophets.” So that He likewise foretold their having to be themselves also slain, after
the example of the prophets. Though, even if He had appointed all this persecution in case
He were obeyed for those only who were then apostles, assuredly through them along with
the entire sacrament, with the shoot of the name, with the layer of the Holy Spirit, the rule
about enduring persecution also would have had respect to us too, as to disciples by inheritance,
and, (as it were,) bushes from the apostolic seed. For even thus again does He address
words of guidance to the apostles: “Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves;”
and, “Beware of men, for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you
in their synagogues; and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a
testimony against them and the Gentiles,” etc.8272 Now when He adds, “But the brother
will deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child; and the children shall rise up
against their parents, and cause them to be put to death,” He has clearly announced with
reference to the others, (that they would be subjected to) this form of unrighteous conduct,
which we do not find exemplified in the case of the apostles. For none of them had experience
of a father or a brother as a betrayer, which very many of us have. Then He returns to the
apostles: “And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake.” How much more shall we,
for whom there exists the necessity of being delivered up by parents too! Thus, by allotting
this very betrayal, now to the apostles, now to all, He pours out the same destruction upon
all the possessors of the name, on whom the name, along with the condition that it be an

<pb n="1430"/>
object of hatred, will rest. But he who will endure on to the end—this man will be saved. By
enduring what but persecution,—betrayal,—death? For to endure to the end is nought else
than to suffer the end. And therefore there immediately follow, “The disciple is not above
his master, nor the servant above his own lord;” because, seeing the Master and Lord Himself
was stedfast in suffering persecution, betrayal and death, much more will it be the duty of
His servants and disciples to bear the same, that they may not seem as if superior to Him,
or to have got an immunity from the assaults of unrighteousness, since this itself should be
glory enough for them, to be conformed to the sufferings of their Lord and Master; and,
preparing them for the endurance of these, He reminds them that they must not fear such
persons as kill the body only, but are not able to destroy the soul, but that they must dedicate
fear to Him rather who has such power that He can kill both body and soul, and destroy
them in hell. Who, pray, are these slayers of the body only, but the governors and kings
aforesaid—men, I ween? Who is the ruler of the soul also, but God only? Who is this but
the threatener of fires hereafter, He without whose will not even one of two sparrows falls
to the ground; that is, not even one of the two substances of man, flesh or spirit, because
the number of our hairs also has been recorded before Him? Fear ye not, therefore. When
He adds, “Ye are of more value than many sparrows,” He makes promise that we shall not
in vain—that is, not without profit—fall to the ground if we choose to be killed by men
rather than by God. “Whosoever therefore will confess in me before men, in him will I
confess also before my Father who is in heaven;8273 and whosoever shall deny me before
men, him will I deny also before my Father who is in heaven.” Clear, as I think, are the terms
used in announcing, and the way to explain, the confession as well as the denial, although
the mode of putting them is different. He who confesses himself a Christian, beareth witness
that he is Christ’s; he who is Christ’s must be in Christ. If he is in Christ, he certainly confesses
in Christ, when he confesses himself a Christian. For he cannot be this without being in
Christ. Besides, by confessing in Christ he confesses Christ too: since, by virtue of being a
Christian, he is in Christ, while Christ Himself also is in him. For if you have made mention
of day, you have also held out to view the element of light which gives us day, although you
may not have made mention of light. Thus, albeit He has not expressly said, “He who will
confess me,” (yet) the conduct involved in daily confession is not different from what is
meant in our Lord’s declaration. For he who confesses himself to be what he is, that is, a
Christian, confesses that likewise by which he is it, that is, Christ. Therefore he who has
denied that he is a Christian, has denied in Christ, by denying that he is in Christ while he
denies that he is a Christian; and, on the other hand, by denying that Christ is in him, while
He denies that he is in Christ, he will deny Christ too. Thus both he who will deny in Christ,
<note type="footnote">8273 The words in the Greek, though correctly rendered in our authorized version, are, when translated literally,
what Tertullian represents them to be.—Tr.</note>

<pb n="1431"/>
will deny Christ, and he who will confess in Christ will confess Christ. It would have been
enough, therefore, though our Lord had made an announcement about confessing merely.
For, from His mode of presenting confession, it might be decided beforehand with reference
to its opposite too—denial, that is—that denial is repaid by the Lord with denial, just as
confession is with confession. And therefore, since in the mould in which the confession
has been cast the state of (the case with reference to) denial also may be perceived, it is
evident that to another manner of denial belongs what the Lord has announced concerning
it, in terms different from those in which He speaks of confession, when He says, “Who will
deny me,” not “Who will deny in me.” For He had foreseen that this form of violence also
would, for the most part, immediately follow when any one had been forced to renounce
the Christian name,—that he who had denied that he was a Christian would be compelled
to deny Christ Himself too by blaspheming Him. As not long ago, alas, we shuddered at
the struggle waged in this way by some with their entire faith, which had had favourable
omens. Therefore it will be to no purpose to say, “Though I shall deny that I am a Christian,
I shall not be denied by Christ, for I have not denied Himself.” For even so much will be
inferred from that denial, by which, seeing he denies Christ in him by denying that he is a
Christian, he has denied Christ Himself also. But there is more, because He threatens likewise
shame with shame (in return): “Whosoever shall be ashamed of me before men, of him will
I also be ashamed before my Father who is in heaven.” For He was aware that denial is
produced even most of all by shame, that the state of the mind appears in the forehead, and
that the wound of shame precedes that in the body.</p>

<p>But as to those who think that not here, that is, not within this environment of earth,
nor during this period of existence, nor before men possessing this nature shared by us all,
has confession been appointed to be made, what a supposition is theirs, being at variance
with the whole order of things of which we have experience in these lands, and in this life,
and under human authorities! Doubtless, when the souls have departed from their bodies,
and begun to be put upon trial in the several stories of the heavens, with reference to the
engagement (under which they have come to Jesus), and to be questioned about those hidden
mysteries of the heretics, they must then confess before the real powers and the real men,—the
Teleti,8274 to wit, and the Abascanti,8275 and the Acineti8276 of Valentinus! For, say they,
even the Demiurge himself did not uniformly approve of the men of our world, whom he
counted as a drop of a bucket,8277 and the dust of the threshing-floor, and spittle and locusts,
and put on a level even with brute beasts. Clearly, it is so written. Yet not therefore must we
understand that there is, besides us, another kind of man, which—for it is evidently thus
(in the case proposed)—has been able to assume without invalidating a comparison between
the two kinds, both the characteristics of the race and a unique property. For even if the life
was tainted, so that condemned to contempt it might be likened to objects held in contempt,
the nature was not forthwith taken away, so that there might be supposed to be another
under its name. Rather is the nature preserved, though the life blushes; nor does Christ
know other men than those with reference to whom He says, “Whom do men say that I
am?”8278 And, “As ye would that men should do to you, do ye likewise so to, them.”8279
Consider whether He may not have preserved a race such that He is looking for a testimony
to Himself from them, as well as consisting of those on whom He enjoins the interchange
of righteous dealing. But if I should urgently demand that those heavenly men be described
to me, Aratus will sketch more easily Perseus and Cepheus, and Erigone, and Ariadne,
among the constellations. But who prevented the Lord from clearly prescribing that confession
by men likewise has to be made where He plainly announced that His own would be;
so that the statement might have run thus: ”Whosoever shall confess in me before men in
heaven, I also will confess in him before my Father who is in heaven?” He ought to have
saved me from this mistake about confession on earth, which He would not have wished
me to take part in, if He had commanded one in heaven; for I knew no other men but the

inhabitants of the earth, man himself even not having up to that time been observed in
heaven. Besides, what is the credibility of the things (alleged), that, being after death raised
to heavenly places, I should be put to the test there, whither I would not be translated without
being already tested, that I should there be tried in reference to a command where I could
not come, but to find admittance? Heaven lies open to the Christian before the way to it
does; because there is no way to heaven, but to him to whom heaven lies open; and he who
reaches it will enter. What powers, keeping guard at the gate, do I hear you affirm to exist
in accordance with Roman superstition, with a certain Carnus, Forculus, and Limentinus?
What powers do you set in order at the railings? If you have ever read in David, “Lift up
your gates, ye princes, and let the everlasting gates be lifted up; and the King of glory shall
enter in;”8280 if you have also heard from Amos, “Who buildeth up to the heavens his way
of ascent, and is such as to pour forth his abundance (of waters) over the earth;”8281 know
that both that way of ascent was thereafter levelled with the ground, by the footsteps of the
Lord, and an entrance thereafter opened up by the might of Christ, and that no delay or
inquest will meet Christians on the threshold, since they have there to be not discriminated
from one another, but owned, and not put to the question, but received in. For though you
think heaven still shut, remember that the Lord left here to Peter and through him to the
Church, the keys of it, which every one who has been here put to the question, and also
made confession, will carry with him. But the devil stoutly affirms that we must confess
there, to persuade us that we must deny here. I shall send before me fine documents, to be
sure,8282 I shall carry with me excellent keys, the fear of them who kill the body only, but
do nought against the soul: I shall be graced by the neglect of this command: I shall stand
with credit in heavenly places, who could not stand in earthly: I shall hold out against the
greater powers, who yielded to the lesser: I shall deserve to be at length let in, though now
shut out. It readily occurs to one to remark further, “If it is in heaven that men must confess,
it is here too that they must deny.” For where the one is, there both are. For contraries always
go together. There will need to be carried on in heaven persecution even, which is the occasion
of confession or denial. Why, then, do you refrain, O most presumptuous heretic, from
transporting to the world above the whole series of means proper to the intimidation of
Christians, and especially to put there the very hatred for the name, where Christ rules at
the right hand of the Father? Will you plant there both synagogues of the Jews—fountains
of persecution—before which the apostles endured the scourge, and heathen assemblages
with their own circus, forsooth, where they readily join in the cry, Death to the third race?8283

But ye are bound to produce in the same place both our brothers, fathers, children, mothersin-
law, daughters-in-law and those of our household, through whose agency the betrayal
has been appointed; likewise kings, governors, and armed authorities, before whom the
matter at issue must be contested. Assuredly there will be in heaven a prison also, destitute
of the sun’s rays or full of light unthankfully, and fetters of the zones perhaps, and, for a
rack-horse, the axis itself which whirls the heavens round. Then, if a Christian is to be stoned,
hail-storms will be near; if burned, thunderbolts are at hand; if butchered, the armed Orion
will exercise his function; if put an end to by beasts, the north will send forth the bears, the
Zodiac the bulls and the lions. He who will endure these assaults to the end, the same shall
be saved. Will there be then, in heaven, both an end, and suffering, a killing, and the first
confession? And where will be the flesh requisite for all this? Where the body which alone
has to be killed by men? Unerring reason has commanded us to set forth these things in
even a playful manner; nor will any one thrust out the bar consisting in this objection (we
have offered), so as not to be compelled to transfer the whole array of means proper to
persecution, all the powerful instrumentality which has been provided for dealing with this
matter, to the place where he has put the court before which confession should be made.
Since confession is elicited by persecution, and persecution ended in confession, there cannot
but be at the same time, in attendance upon these, the instrumentality which determines
both the entrance and the exit, that is, the beginning and the end. But both hatred for the
name will be here, persecution breaks out here, betrayal brings men forth here, examination
uses force here, torture rages here, and confession or denial completes this whole course of
procedure on the earth. Therefore, if the other things are here, confession also is not elsewhere;
if confession is elsewhere, the other things also are not here. Certainly the other
things are not elsewhere; therefore neither is confession in heaven. Or, if they will have it
that the manner in which the heavenly examination and confession take place is different,
it will certainly be also incumbent on them to devise a mode of procedure of their own of
a very different kind, and opposed to that method which is indicated in the Scriptures. And
we may be able to say, Let them consider (whether what they imagine to exist does so), if
so be that this course of procedure, proper to examination and confession on earth—a course
which has persecution as the source in which it originates, and which pleads dissension in
the state—is preserved to its own faith, if so be that we must believe just as is also written,
and understand just as is spoken. Here I endure the entire course (in question), the Lord
Himself not appointing a different quarter of the world for my doing so. For what does He
add after finishing with confession and denial? “Think not that I am come to send peace
on earth, but a sword,”—undoubtedly on the earth. “For I am come to set a man at variance
against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the mother-in-law against her
daughter-in-law. And a man’s foes shall be they of his own household.”8284 For so is it
<note type="footnote">8284 Matt. x. 34.</note>

<pb n="1435"/>
brought to pass, that the brother delivers up the brother to death, and the father the son:
and the children rise up against the parents, and cause them to die. And he who endureth
to the end let that man be saved.8285 So that this whole course of procedure characteristic
of the Lord’s sword, which has been sent not to heaven, but to earth, makes confession also
to be there, which by enduring to the end is to issue in the suffering of death.</p>

<p>In the same manner, therefore, we maintain that the other announcements too refer to
the condition of martyrdom. “He,” says Jesus, “who will value his own life also more than
me, is not worthy of me,”8286—that is, he who will rather live by denying, than die by confessing,
me; and “he who findeth his life shall lose it; but he who loseth it for my sake shall
find it.”8287 Therefore indeed he finds it, who, in winning life, denies; but he who thinks
that he wins it by denying, will lose it in hell. On the other hand, he who, through confessing,
is killed, will lose it for the present, but is also about to find it unto everlasting life. In fine,
governors themselves, when they urge men to deny, say, “Save your life;” and, “Do not lose
your life.” How would Christ speak, but in accordance with the treatment to which the
Christian would be subjected? But when He forbids thinking about what answer to make
at a judgment-seat,8288 He is preparing His own servants for what awaited them, He gives
the assurance that the Holy Spirit will answer by them; and when He wishes a brother to be
visited in prison,8289 He is commanding that those about to confess be the object of solicitude;
and He is soothing their sufferings when He asserts that God will avenge His own elect.8290
In the parable also of the withering of the word8291 after the green blade had sprung up, He
is drawing a picture with reference to the burning heat of persecutions. If these announcements
are not understood as they are made, without doubt they signify something else than
the sound indicates; and there will be one thing in the words, another in their meanings, as
is the case with allegories, with parables, with riddles. Whatever wind of reasoning, therefore,
these scorpions may catch (in their sails), with whatever subtlety they may attack, there is
now one line of defence:8292 an appeal will be made to the facts themselves, whether they
occur as the Scriptures represent that they would; since another thing will then be meant
in the Scriptures if that very one (which seems to be so) is not found in actual facts. For
what is written, must needs come to pass. Besides, what is written will then come to pass, if
something different does not. But, lo! we are both regarded as persons to be hated by all
men for the sake of the name, as it is written; and are delivered up by our nearest of kin also,
as it is written; and are brought before magistrates, and examined, and tortured, and make
confession, and are ruthlessly killed, as it is written. So the Lord ordained. If He ordained
these events otherwise, why do they not come to pass otherwise than He ordained them,

<pb n="1437"/>
that is, as He ordained them? And yet they do not come to pass otherwise than He ordained.
Therefore, as they come to pass, so He ordained; and as He ordained, so they come to pass.
For neither would they have been permitted to occur otherwise than He ordained, nor for
His part would He have ordained otherwise than He would wish them to occur. Thus these
passages of Scripture will not mean ought else than we recognise in actual facts; or if those
events are not yet taking place which are announced, how are those taking place which have
not been announced? For these events which are taking place have not been announced, if
those which are announced are different, and not these which are taking place. Well now,
seeing the very occurrences are met with in actual life which are believed to have been expressed
with a different meaning in words, what would happen if they were found to have
come to pass in a different manner than had been revealed? But this will be the waywardness
of faith, not to believe what has been demonstrated, to assume the truth of what has not
been demonstrated. And to this waywardness I will offer the following objection also, that
if these events, which occur as is written, will not be the very ones which are announced,
those too (which are meant) ought not to occur as is written, that they themselves also may
not, after the example of these others, be in danger of exclusion, since there is one thing in
the words and another in the facts; and there remains that even the events which have been
announced are not seen when they occur, if they are announced otherwise than they have
to occur. And how will those be believed (to have come to pass), which will not have been
announced as they come to pass? Thus heretics, by not believing what is announced as it
has been shown to have taken place, believe what has not been even announced.</p>

<p>Who, now, should know better the marrow of the Scriptures than the school of Christ
itself?—the persons whom the Lord both chose for Himself as scholars, certainly to be fully
instructed in all points, and appointed to us for masters to instruct us in all points. To whom
would He have rather made known the veiled import of His own language, than to him to
whom He disclosed the likeness of His own glory—to Peter, John, and James, and afterwards
to Paul, to whom He granted participation in (the joys of) paradise too, prior to his martyrdom?
Or do they also write differently from what they think—teachers using deceit, not
truth? Addressing the Christians of Pontus, Peter, at all events, says, “How great indeed is
the glory, if ye suffer patiently, without being punished as evildoers! For this is a lovely feature,
and even hereunto were ye called, since Christ also suffered for us, leaving you Himself as
an example, that ye should follow His own steps.”8293 And again: “Beloved, be not alarmed
by the fiery trial which is taking place among you, as though some strange thing happened
unto you. For, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings, do ye rejoice; that, when
His glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. If ye are reproached for
the name of Christ, happy are ye; because glory and the Spirit of God rest upon you: if only
none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evil-doer, or as a busybody in other
men’s matters; yet (if any man suffer) as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him
glorify God on this behalf.”8294 John, in fact, exhorts us to lay down our lives even for our
brethren,8295 affirming that there is no fear in love: “For perfect love casteth out fear, since
fear has punishment; and he who fears is not perfect in love.”8296 What fear would it be
better to understand (as here meant), than that which gives rise to denial? What love does
he assert to be perfect, but that which puts fear to flight, and gives courage to confess? What
penalty will he appoint as the punishment of fear, but that which he who denies is about to
pay, who has to be slain, body and soul, in hell? And if he teaches that we must die for the
brethren, how much more for the Lord,—he being sufficiently prepared, by his own Revelation
too, for giving such advice! For indeed the Spirit had sent the injunction to the angel
of the church in Smyrna: “Behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may
be tried ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.”8297 Also
to the angel of the church in Pergamus (mention was made) of Antipas,8298 the very faithful
martyr, who was slain where Satan dwelleth. Also to the angel of the church in Phil-

adelphia8299 (it was signified) that he who had not denied the name of the Lord was delivered
from the last trial. Then to every conqueror the Spirit promises now the tree of life, and exemption
from the second death; now the hidden manna with the stone of glistening whiteness,
and the name unknown (to every man save him that receiveth it); now power to rule
with a rod of iron, and the brightness of the morning star; now the being clothed in white
raiment, and not having the name blotted out of the book of life, and being made in the
temple of God a pillar with the inscription on it of the name of God and of the Lord, and
of the heavenly Jerusalem; now a sitting with the Lord on His throne,—which once was
persistently refused to the sons of Zebedee.8300 Who, pray, are these so blessed conquerors,
but martyrs in the strict sense of the word? For indeed theirs are the victories whose also
are the fights; theirs, however, are the fights whose also is the blood. But the souls of the
martyrs both peacefully rest in the meantime under the altar,8301 and support their patience
by the assured hope of revenge; and, clothed in their robes, wear the dazzling halo of
brightness, until others also may fully share in their glory. For yet again a countless throng
are revealed, clothed in white and distinguished by palms of victory, celebrating their triumph
doubtless over Antichrist, since one of the elders says, “These are they who come out of that
great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the
Lamb.”8302 For the flesh is the clothing of the soul. The uncleanness, indeed, is washed away
by baptism, but the stains are changed into dazzling whiteness by martyrdom. For Esaias
also promises, that out of red and scarlet there will come forth the whiteness of snow and
wool.8303 When great Babylon likewise is represented as drunk with the blood of the
saints,8304 doubtless the supplies needful for her drunkenness are furnished by the cups of
martyrdoms; and what suffering the fear of martyrdoms will entail, is in like manner shown.
For among all the castaways, nay, taking precedence of them all, are the fearful. “But the
fearful,” says John—and then come the others—“will have their part in the lake of fire and
brimstone.”8305 Thus fear, which, as stated in his epistle, love drives out, has punishment.</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.</head>
<p>But how Paul, an apostle, from being a persecutor, who first of all shed the blood of the
church, though afterwards he exchanged the sword for the pen, and turned the dagger into
a plough, being first a ravening wolf of Benjamin, then himself supplying food as did Jacob,
8306—how he, (I say,) speaks in favour of martyrdoms, now to be chosen by himself also,
when, rejoicing over the Thessalonians, he says, “So that we glory in you in the churches of
God, for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations, in which ye endure
a manifestation of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be accounted worthy of His
kingdom, for which ye also suffer!”8307 As also in his Epistle to the Romans: “And not only
so, but we glory in tribulations also, being sure that tribulation worketh patience, and patience
experience, and experience hope; and hope maketh not ashamed.”8308 And again: “And if
children, then heirs, heirs indeed of God, and joint-heirs with Christ: if so be that we suffer
with Him, that we may be also glorified together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this
time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.”8309 And
therefore he afterward says: “Who shall separate us from the love of God? Shall tribulation,
or distress, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? (As it is written: For Thy sake we
are killed all the day long; we have been counted as sheep for the slaughter.) Nay, in all these
things we are more than conquerors, through Him who loved us. For we are persuaded,
that neither death, nor life, nor power, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall
be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”8310 But further,
in recounting his own sufferings to the Corinthians, he certainly decided that suffering
must be borne: “In labours, (he says,) more abundant, in prisons very frequent, in deaths
oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes, save one; thrice was I beaten with rods;
once was I stoned,”8311 and the rest. And if these severities will seem to be more grievous
than martyrdoms, yet once more he says: “Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches,
in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake.”8312 He also says, in
verses occurring in a previous part of the epistle: “Our condition is such, that we are troubled
on every side, yet not distressed; and are in need, but not in utter want; since we are harassed
by persecutions, but not forsaken; it is such that we are cast down, but not destroyed; always

bearing about in our body the dying of Christ.”8313 “But though,” says he, “our outward
man perisheth”—the flesh doubtless, by the violence of persecutions—“yet the inward man
is renewed day by day”—the soul, doubtless, by hope in the promises. “For our light affliction,
which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;
while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the
things which are seen are temporal”—he is speaking of troubles; “but the things which are
not seen are eternal”—he is promising rewards. But writing in bonds to the Thessalonians,8314
he certainly affirmed that they were blessed, since to them it had been given not only to
believe on Christ, but also to suffer for His sake. “Having,” says he, “the same conflict which
ye both saw in me, and now hear to be in me.”8315 “For though I am offered upon the sacrifice,
I joy and rejoice with you all; in like manner do ye also joy and rejoice with me.” You
see what he decides the bliss of martyrdom to be, in honour of which he is providing a
festival of mutual joy. When at length he had come to be very near the attainment of his
desire, greatly rejoicing in what he saw before him, he writes in these terms to Timothy:
“For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the
good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith; there is laid up for me the crown
which the Lord will give me on that day”8316—doubtless of his suffering. Admonition enough
did he for his part also give in preceding passages: “It is a faithful saying: For if we are dead
with Christ, we shall also live with Him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him; if we deny
Him, He also will deny us; if we believe not, yet He is faithful: He cannot deny Himself.”8317
“Be not thou, therefore, ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner;”8318
for he had said before: “For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of
love, and of a sound mind.”8319 For we suffer with power from love toward God, and with
a sound mind, when we suffer for our blamelessness. But further, if He anywhere enjoins
endurance, for what more than for sufferings is He providing it? If anywhere He tears men
away from idolatry, what more than martyrdoms takes the lead, in tearing them away to its
injury?</p>

<head>Chapter XIV.</head>
<p>No doubt the apostle admonishes the Romans8320 to be subject to all power, because
there is no power but of God, and because (the ruler) does not carry the sword without
reason, and is the servant of God, nay also, says he, a revenger to execute wrath upon him
that doeth evil. For he had also previously spoken thus: “For rulers are not a terror to a good
work, but to an evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and
thou shalt have praise of it. Therefore he is a minister of God to thee for good. But if thou
do that which is evil, be afraid.” Thus he bids you be subject to the powers, not on an opportunity
occurring for his avoiding martyrdom, but when he is making an appeal in behalf of
a good life, under the view also of their being as it were assistants bestowed upon righteousness,
as it were handmaids of the divine court of justice, which even here pronounces sentence
beforehand upon the guilty. Then he goes on also to show how he wishes you to be subject
to the powers, bidding you pay “tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom,”8321
that is, the things which are Cæsar’s to Cæsar, and the things which are God’s to God;8322
but man is the property of God alone. Peter,8323 no doubt, had likewise said that the king
indeed must be honoured, yet so that the king be honoured only when he keeps to his own
sphere, when he is far from assuming divine honours; because both father and mother will
be loved along with God, not put on an equality with Him. Besides, one will not be permitted
to love even life more than God.</p>

<p>Now, then, the epistles of the apostles also are well known. And do we, (you say), in all
respects guileless souls and doves merely, love to go astray? I should think from eagerness
to live. But let it be so, that meaning departs from their epistles. And yet, that the apostles
endured such sufferings, we know: the teaching is clear. This only I perceive in running
through the Acts. I am not at all on the search. The prisons there, and the bonds, and the
scourges, and the big stones, and the swords, and the onsets by the Jews, and the assemblies
of the heathen, and the indictments by tribunes, and the hearing of causes by kings, and the
judgment-seats of proconsuls and the name of Cæsar, do not need an interpreter. That Peter
is struck,8324 that Stephen is overwhelmed by stones,8325 that James is slain8326 as is a victim
at the altar, that Paul is beheaded has been written in their own blood. And if a heretic wishes
his confidence to rest upon a public record, the archives of the empire will speak, as would
the stones of Jerusalem. We read the lives of the Cæsars: At Rome Nero was the first who
stained with blood the rising faith. Then is Peter girt by another,8327 when he is made fast
to the cross. Then does Paul obtain a birth suited to Roman citizenship, when in Rome he
springs to life again ennobled by martyrdom. Wherever I read of these occurrences, so soon
as I do so, I learn to suffer; nor does it signify to me which I follow as teachers of martyrdom,
whether the declarations or the deaths of the apostles, save that in their deaths I recall their
declarations also. For they would not have suffered ought of a kind they had not previously
known they had to suffer. When Agabus, making use of corresponding action too, had
foretold that bonds awaited Paul, the disciples, weeping and entreating that he would not
venture upon going to Jerusalem, entreated in vain.8328 As for him, having a mind to illustrate
what he had always taught, he says, “Why weep ye, and grieve my heart? But for my part, I
could wish not only to suffer bonds, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of my Lord
Jesus Christ.” And so they yielded by saying, “Let the will of the Lord be done;” feeling sure,
doubtless, that sufferings are included in the will of God. For they had tried to keep him
back with the intention not of dissuading, but to show love for him; as yearning for (the
preservation of) the apostle, not as counselling against martyrdom. And if even then a
Prodicus or Valentinus stood by, suggesting that one must not confess on the earth before
men, and must do so the less in truth, that God may not (seem to) thirst for blood, and
Christ for a repayment of suffering, as though He besought it with the view of obtaining

salvation by it for Himself also, he would have immediately heard from the servant of God
what the devil had from the Lord: “Get thee behind me, Satan; thou art an offence unto me.
It is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.”8329 But
even now it will be right that he hear it, seeing that, long after, he has poured forth these
poisons, which not even thus are to injure readily any of the weak ones, if any one in faith
will drink, before being hurt, or even immediately after, this draught of ours.

<p>Against all Heresies.8330</p>
<p>[Translated by Rev. S. Thelwall.]</p>

 <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>Chapter I.—Earliest Heretics:8331 Simon Magus, Menander, Saturninus, Basilides,
Nicolaus. [The Work Begins as a Fragment.]</head>
<p>Of which heretics I will (to pass by a good deal) summarize some few particulars. For
of Judaism’s heretics I am silent—Dositheus the Samaritan, I mean, who was the first who
had the hardihood to repudiate the prophets, on the ground that they had not spoken under
inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Of the Sadducees I am silent, who, springing from the root
of this error, had the hardihood to adjoin to this heresy the denial likewise of the resurrection
of the flesh.8332 The Pharisees I pretermit, who were “divided” from the Jews by their superimposing
of certain additaments to the law, which fact likewise made them worthy of receiving
this very name;8333 and, together with them, the Herodians likewise, who said that
Herod was Christ. To those I betake myself who have chosen to make the gospel the startingpoint
of their heresies.</p>
<p>Of these the first of all is Simon Magus, who in the Acts of the Apostles earned a condign
and just sentence from the Apostle Peter.8334 He had the hardihood to call himself the Supreme
Virtue,8335 that is, the Supreme God; and moreover, (to assert) that the universe8336
had been originated by his angels; that he had descended in quest of an erring dæmon,8337

which was Wisdom; that, in a phantasmal semblance of God, he had not suffered among
the Jews, but was as if he had suffered.8338</p>
<p>After him Menander, his disciple (likewise a magician8339), saying the same as Simon.
Whatever Simon had affirmed himself to be, this did Menander equally affirm himself to
be, asserting that none could possibly have salvation without being baptized in his name.</p>
<p>Afterwards, again, followed Saturninus: he, too, affirming that the innascible8340 Virtue,
that is God, abides in the highest regions, and that those regions are infinite, and in the regions
immediately above us; but that angels far removed from Him made the lower world;8341
and that, because light from above had flashed refulgently in the lower regions, the angels
had carefully tried to form man after the similitude of that light; that man lay crawling on
the surface of the earth; that this light and this higher virtue was, thanks to mercy, the salvable
spark in man, while all the rest of him perishes;8342 that Christ had not existed in a bodily
substance, and had endured a quasi-passion in a phantasmal shape merely; that a resurrection
of the flesh there will by no means be.</p>
<p>Afterwards broke out the heretic Basilides. He affirms that there is a supreme Deity, by
name Abraxas,8343 by whom was created Mind, which in Greek he calls Νοῦς; that thence
sprang the Word; that of Him issued Providence, Virtue,8344 and Wisdom; that out of these
subsequently were made Principalities, powers,8345 and Angels; that there ensued infinite
issues and processions of angels; that by these angels 365 heavens were formed, and the
world,8346 in honour of Abraxas, whose name, if computed, has in itself this number. Now,
among the last of the angels, those who made this world,8347 he places the God of the Jews
latest, that is, the God of the Law and of the Prophets, whom he denies to be a God, but affirms
to be an angel. To him, he says, was allotted the seed of Abraham, and accordingly he
it was who transferred the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt into the land of Canaan;
affirming him to be turbulent above the other angels, and accordingly given to the frequent
arousing of seditions and wars, yes, and the shedding of human blood. Christ, moreover,
he affirms to have been sent, not by this maker of the world,8348 but by the above-named

Abraxas; and to have come in a phantasm, and been destitute of the substance of flesh: that
it was not He who suffered among the Jews, but that Simon8349 was crucified in His stead:
whence, again, there must be no believing on him who was crucified, lest one confess to
having believed on Simon. Martyrdoms, he says, are not to be endured. The resurrection
of the flesh he strenuously impugns, affirming that salvation has not been promised to
bodies.</p>
<p>A brother heretic8350 emerged in Nicolaus. He was one of the seven deacons who were
appointed in the Acts of the Apostles.8351 He affirms that Darkness was seized with a concupiscence—
and, indeed, a foul and obscene one—after Light: out of this permixture it is
a shame to say what fetid and unclean (combinations arose). The rest (of his tenets), too,
are obscene. For he tells of certain Æons, sons of turpitude, and of conjunctions of execrable
and obscene embraces and permixtures,8352 and certain yet baser outcomes of these. He
teaches that there were born, moreover, dæmons, and gods, and spirits seven, and other
things sufficiently sacrilegious. alike and foul, which we blush to recount, and at once pass
them by. Enough it is for us that this heresy of the Nicolaitans has been condemned by the
Apocalypse of the Lord with the weightiest authority attaching to a sentence, in saying
“Because this thou holdest, thou hatest the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which I too hate.”8353</p>

<head>Chapter II.—Ophites, Cainites, Sethites.</head>
<p>To these are added those heretics likewise who are called Ophites:8354 for they magnify
the serpent to such a degree, that they prefer him even to Christ Himself; for it was he, they
say, who gave us the origin of the knowledge of good and of evil.8355 His power and majesty
(they say) Moses perceiving, set up the brazen serpent; and whoever gazed upon him obtained
health.8356 Christ Himself (they say further) in His gospel imitates Moses’ serpent’s sacred
power, in saying: “And as Moses upreared the serpent in the desert, so it behoveth the Son
of man to be upreared.”8357 Him they introduce to bless their eucharistic (elements).8358
Now the whole parade and doctrine of this error flowed from the following source. They
say that from the supreme primary Æon whom men speak of8359 there emanated several
other inferior Æons. To all these, however, there opposed himself an Æon who name is
Ialdabaoth.8360 He had been conceived by the permixture of a second Æon with inferior
Æons; and afterwards, when he8361 had been desirous of forcing his way into the higher
regions, had been disabled by the permixture of the gravity of matter with himself to arrive
at the higher regions; had been left in the midst, and had extended himself to his full dimensions,
and thus had made the sky.8362 Ialdabaoth, however, had descended lower, and had
made him seven sons, and had shut from their view the upper regions by self-distension,
in order that, since (these) angels could not know what was above,8363 they might think
him the sole God. These inferior Virtues and angels, therefore, had made man; and, because
he had been originated by weaker and mediocre powers, he lay crawling, worm-like. That
Æon, however, out of which Ialdaboath had proceeded, moved to the heart with envy, had
injected into man as he lay a certain spark; excited whereby, he was through prudence to
grow wise, and be able to understand the things above. So, again, the Ialdaboath aforesaid,
turning indignant, had emitted out of himself the Virtue and similitude of the serpent; and

this had been the Virtue in paradise—that is, this had been the serpent—whom Eve had
believed as if he had been God the Son.8364 He8365 plucked, say they, from the fruit of the
tree, and thus conferred on mankind the knowledge of things good and evil.8366 Christ,
moreover, existed not in substance of flesh: salvation of the flesh is not to be hoped for at
all.</p>
<p>Moreover, also, there has broken out another heresy also, which is called that of the
Cainites.8367 And the reason is, that they magnify Cain as if he had been conceived of some
potent Virtue which operated in him; for Abel had been procreated after being conceived
of an inferior Virtue, and accordingly had been found inferior. They who assert this likewise
defend the traitor Judas, telling us that he is admirable and great, because of the advantages
he is vaunted to have conferred on mankind; for some of them think that thanksgiving is
to be rendered to Judas on this account: viz., Judas, they say, observing that Christ wished
to subvert the truth, betrayed Him, in order that there might be no possibility of truth’s
being subverted. And others thus dispute against them, and say: Because the powers of this
world8368 were unwilling that Christ should suffer, lest through His death salvation should
be prepared for mankind, he, consulting for the salvation of mankind, betrayed Christ, in
order that there might be no possibility at all of the salvation being impeded, which was
being impeded through the Virtues which were opposing Christ’s passion; and thus, through
the passion of Christ, there might be no possibility of the salvation of mankind being retarded.</p>
<p>But, again, the heresy has started forth which is called that of the Sethites.8369 The doctrine
of this perversity is as follows. Two human beings were formed by the angels—Cain
and Abel. On their account arose great contentions and discords among the angels; for this
reason, that Virtue which was above all the Virtues—which they style the Mother—when
they said8370 that Abel had been slain, willed this Seth of theirs to be conceived and born
in place of Abel, in order that those angels might be escheated who had created those two
former human beings, while this pure seed rises and is born. For they say that there had
been iniquitous permixtures of two angels and human beings; for which reason that Virtue
which (as we have said) they style the Mother brought on the deluge even, for the purpose
of vengeance, in order that that seed of permixture might be swept away, and this only seed

seed sent into the ark (secretly and stealthily, and unknown to that Mother-Virtue), together
with those “eight souls,”8371 the seed likewise of Ham, in order that the seed of evil should
not perish, but should, together with the rest, be preserved, and after the deluge be restored
to the earth, and, by example of the rest, should grow up and diffuse itself, and fill and occupy
the whole orb.8372 Of Christ, moreover, their sentiments are such that they call Him merely
Seth, and say that He was instead of the actual Seth.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Carpocrates, Cerinthus, Ebion.</head>
<p>Carpocrates, furthermore, introduced the following sect. He affirms that there is one
Virtue, the chief among the upper (regions): that out of this were produced angels and
Virtues, which, being far distant from the upper Virtues, created this world8373 in the lower
regions: that Christ was not born of the Virgin Mary, but was generated—a mere human
being—of the seed of Joseph, superior (they admit) above all others in the practice of
righteousness and in integrity of life; that He suffered among the Jews; and that His soul
alone was received in heaven as having been more firm and hardy than all others: whence
he would infer, retaining only the salvation of souls, that there are no resurrections of the
body.</p>

world8374 was originated by those angels;8375 and sets forth Christ as born of the seed of
Joseph, contending that He was merely human, without divinity; affirming also that the
Law was given by angels;8376 representing the God of the Jews as not the Lord, but an angel.</p>
<p>His successor was Ebion,8377 not agreeing with Cerinthus in every point; in that he affirms
the world8378 to have been made by God, not by angels; and because it is written, “No
disciple above his master, nor servant above his lord,”8379 sets forth likewise the law as

<head>Chapter IV.—Valentinus, Ptolemy and Secundus, Heracleon.</head>
<p>Valentinus the heretic, moreover, introduced many fables. These I will retrench and
briefly summarize. For he introduces the Pleroma and the thirty Æons. These Æons,
moreover, he explains in the way of syzygies, that is, conjugal unions8381 of some kind. For
among the first,8382 he says, were Depth8383 and Silence; of these proceeded Mind and
Truth; out of whom burst the Word and Life; from whom, again, were created Man8384 and
the Church. But (these are not all); for of these last also proceeded twelve Æons; from
Speech,8385 moreover, and Life proceeded other ten Æons: such is the Triacontad of Æons,
which is made up in the Pleroma of an ogdoad, a decad, and a duodecad. The thirtieth Æon,
moreover, willed to see the great Bythus; and, to see him, had the hardihood to ascend into
the upper regions; and not being capable of seeing his magnitude, desponded,8386 and almost
suffered dissolution, had not some one,—he whom he calls Horos, to wit,—sent to invigorate
him, strengthened him by pronouncing the word “Iao.”8387 This Æon, moreover, which
was thus reduced to despondency, he calls Achamoth, (and says) that he was seized with
certain regretful passions, and out of his passions gave birth to material essences.8388 For
<note type="footnote">8381 Conjugationes. Cowper uses our word “conjugation” in this sense in one of his humorous pieces.
[“Pairing-time.”] The “syzygies” consisted of one male and one female Æon each.</note>

<note type="footnote">8388 Such appears to be the meaning of this sentence as Oehler gives it. But the text is here corrupt; and it
seems plain there must either be something lost relating to this “Achamoth,” or else some capital error in the
reading, or, thirdly, some gross and unaccountable confusion in the writer: for the sentence as it stands is wholly
irreconcilable with what follows. It evidently makes “Achamoth” identical with “the thirtieth Æon” above-named;
and yet, without introducing any fresh subject, the writer goes on to state that this despondent OEon, who
“conceived and bare,” was itself the offspring of despondency, and made an infirm world out of the infirm materials
which “Achamoth” supposed it with. Now it is apparent from other sources—as, for instance, from Tert.
adv. Valentin, above referred to—that the “thirtieth Æon” was supposed to be female, Sophia (Wisdom) by
name, and that she was said to be the parent of “Achamoth,” or “Enthymesis” (see adv. Valentin. cc. ix. x. xi.
xiv. xxv.), while “Achamoth” herself appears by some accounts to be also called κάτω Σοφία. The name
“Achamoth” itself, which Tertullian (adv. Valentin. c. xiv. ad init.) calls an “uninterpretable name,” is believed
to be a representation of a Hebrew word meaning “wisdom;” and hence, possibly, some of the confusion may</note>

he was panic-stricken, he says, and terror-stricken, and overcome with sadness; and of these
passions he conceived and bare. Hence he made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and
whatever is in them: for which cause all things made by him are infirm, and frail, and capable
of falling, and mortal, inasmuch as he himself was conceived and produced from despondency.
He, however, originated this world8389 out of those material essences which Achamoth,
by his panic, or terror, or sadness, or sweat, had supplied. For of his panic, he says, was made
darkness; of his fear and ignorance, the spirits of wickedness and malignity; of his sadness
and tears, the humidities of founts, the material essence of floods and sea. Christ, moreover,
was sent by that First-Father who is Bythus. He, moreover, was not in the substance of our
flesh; but, bringing down from heaven some spiritual body or other, passed through the
Virgin Mary as water through a pipe, neither receiving nor borrowing aught thence. The
resurrection of our present flesh he denies, but (maintains that) of some sister-flesh.8390 Of
the Law and the prophets some parts he approves, some he disapproves; that is, he disapproves
all in reprobating some. A Gospel of his own he likewise has, beside these of ours.</p>
<p>After him arose the heretics Ptolemy and Secundus, who agree throughout with
Valentinus, differing only in the following point: viz., whereas Valentinus had feigned but
thirty Æons, they have added several more; for they first added four, and subsequently four
more. And Valentine’s assertion, that it was the thirtieth Æon which strayed out from the
Pleroma, (as falling into despondency,) they deny; for the one which desponded on account
of disappointed yearning to see the First-Father was not of the original triacontad, they say.</p>
<p>There arose, besides, Heracleon, a brother8391-heretic, whose sentiments pair with
Valentine’s; but, by some novelty of terminology, he is desirous of seeming to differ in sentiment.
For he introduces the notion that there existed first what he terms (a Monad);8392
<note type="footnote">have arisen,—from a promiscuous use, namely, of the titles “Achamoth” and “Sophia.” Moreover, it would appear
that some words lower down as to the production by “Achamoth” of “Demiurgus,” must have dropped out.
Unless these two omissions be supplied, the passage is wholly unintelligible. Can the fact that the Hebrew word
which “Achamoth” represents is a fem. pl. in any way explain this confused medley, or help to reconcile conflicting
accounts? The ἄνω and κάτω Σοφία seem to point in some degree to some such solution of some of the existing
difficulties. “Iao,” again, is a word which has cause much perplexity. Can it possibly be connected with ἰάομαι,
“to heal?” [See note 8.]</note>

<head>Chapter V.—Marcus and Colarbasus.</head>
<p>After these there were not wanting a Marcus and a Colarbasus, composing a novel
heresy out of the Greek alphabet. For they affirm that without those letters truth cannot be
found; nay more, that in those letters the whole plenitude and perfection of truth is comprised;
for this was why Christ said, “I am the Alpha and the Omega.”8393 In fact, they say
that Jesus Christ descended,8394 that is, that the dove came down on Jesus;8395 and, since
the dove is styled by the Greek name περιστερά —(peristera), it has in itself this number
DCCCI.8396 These men run through their Ω, Ψ, Χ, Φ, Υ, Τ—through the whole alphabet,
indeed, up to Α and Β—and compute ogdoads and decads. So we may grant it useless and
idle to recount all their trifles. What, however, must be allowed not merely vain, but likewise
dangerous, is this: they feign a second God, beside the Creator; they affirm that Christ was
not in the substance of flesh; they say there is to be no resurrection of the flesh.</p>

is ascertainable from the confused and discrepant account of it, there would appear to have been one Æon called
Christ, another called Jesus, and a human person called Jesus and Christ, with whom the true Jesus associated
Himself. Some such jumble of ideas the two heretics now under review would seem to have held, if Oehler’s be
the true reading. But the difficulties are somewhat lessened if we accept the very simple emendation which naturally
suggests itself, and which, I see, Semler has proposed and Routh inclines to receive, “in Jesum Christum
descendisse,” i.e. “that Christ descended on Jesus.”</note>

<head>Chapter VI.—Cerdo, Marcion, Lucan, Apelles.</head>
<p>To this is added one Cerdo. He introduces two first causes,8397 that is, two Gods—one
good, the other cruel:8398 the good being the superior; the latter, the cruel one, being the
creator of the world.8399 He repudiates the prophecies and the Law; renounces God the
Creator; maintains that Christ who came was the Son of the superior God; affirms that He
was not in the substance of flesh; states Him to have been only in a phantasmal shape, to
have not really suffered, but undergone a quasipassion, and not to have been born of a virgin,
nay, really not to have been born at all. A resurrection of the soul merely does he approve,
denying that of the body. The Gospel of Luke alone, and that not entire, does he receive.
Of the Apostle Paul he takes neither all the epistles, nor in their integrity. The Acts of the
Apostles and the Apocalypse he rejects as false.</p>
<p>After him emerged a disciple of his, one Marcion by name, a native of Pontus,8400 son
of a bishop, excommunicated because of a rape committed on a certain virgin.8401 He,
starting from the fact that it is said, “Every good tree beareth good fruit, but an evil evil,”8402
attempted to approve the heresy of Cerdo; so that his assertions are identical with those of
the former heretic before him.</p>
<p>After him arose one Lucan by name, a follower and disciple of Marcion. He, too, wading
through the same kinds of blasphemy, teaches the same as Marcion and Cerdo had taught.</p>
<p>Close on their heels follows Apelles, a disciple of Marcion, who after lapsing, into his
own carnality,8403 was severed from Marcion. He introduces one God in the infinite upper
regions, and states that He made many powers and angels; beside Him, withal, another
Virtue, which he affirms to be called Lord, but represents as an angel. By him he will have
it appear that the world8404 was originated in imitation of a superior world.8405 With this
lower world he mingled throughout (a principle of) repentance, because he had not made
it so perfectly as that superior world had been originated. The Law and the prophets he re-

and airy8406 flesh; and, in His resurrection, restored, in the course of His ascent, to the several
individual elements whatever had been borrowed in His descent: and thus—the several
parts of His body dispersed—He reinstated in heaven His spirit only. This man denies the
resurrection of the flesh. He uses, too, one only apostle; but that is Marcion’s, that is, a mu-
tilated one. He teaches the salvation of souls alone. He has, besides, private but extraordinary
lections of his own, which he calls “Manifestations”8407 of one Philumene,8408 a girl whom

<p>To all these heretics is added one Tatian, a brother-heretic. This man was Justin Martyr’s
disciple. After Justin’s death he began to cherish different opinions from his. For he wholly
savours of Valentinus; adding this, that Adam cannot even attain salvation: as if, when the
branches become salvable,8409 the root were not!</p>
<p>Other heretics swell the list who are called Cataphrygians, but their teaching is not
uniform. For there are (of them) some who are called Cataproclans;8410 there are others
who are termed Catæschinetans.8411 These have a blasphemy common, and a blasphemy
not common, but peculiar and special. The common blasphemy lies in their saying that the
Holy Spirit was in the apostles indeed, the Paraclete was not; and in their saying that the
Paraclete has spoken in Montanus more things than Christ brought forward into (the
compass of) the Gospel, and not merely more, but likewise better and greater. But the particular
one they who follow Æschines have; this, namely, whereby they add this, that they
affirm Christ to be Himself Son and Father.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Blastus, Two Theodoti, Praxeas.</head>
<p>In addition to all these, there is likewise Blastus, who would latently introduce Judaism.
For he says the passover is not to be kept otherwise than according to the law of Moses, on
the fourteenth of the month. But who would fail to see that evangelical grace is escheated
if he recalls Christ to the Law?</p>
<p>Add to these Theodotus the Byzantine, who, after being apprehended for Christ’s Name,
and apostatizing,8412 ceased not to blaspheme against Christ. For he introduced a doctrine
by which to affirm that Christ was merely a human being, but deny His deity; teaching that
He was born of the Holy Spirit indeed of a virgin, but was a solitary and bare human being,
8413 with no pre-eminence above the rest (of mankind), but only that of righteousness.</p>
<p>After him brake out a second heretical Theodotus, who again himself introduced a sistersect,
and says that the human being Christ Himself8414 was merely conceived alike, and
born, of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, but that He was inferior to Melchizedek; because
it is said of Christ, “Thou art a priest unto eternity, after the order of Melchizedek.”8415 For
that Melchizedek, he says, was a heavenly Virtue of pre-eminent grace; in that Christ acts
for human beings, being made their Deprecator and Advocate: Melchizedek does so8416
for heavenly angels and Virtues. For to such a degree, he says, is he better than Christ, that
he is ἀπάτωρ (fatherless), ἀμήτωρ (motherless), ἀγενεαλογητον (without genealogy), of
whom neither the beginning nor the end has been comprehended, nor can be comprehended.
8417</p>
<p>But after all these, again, one Praxeas introduced a heresy which Victorinus8418 was
careful to corroborate. He asserts that Jesus Christ is God the Father Almighty. Him he
contends to have been crucified, and suffered, and died; beside which, with a profane and

Praxeas was there. His successor was Zephyrinus; and it is an ingenious conjecture of Oehler, that these two

On Repentance.8420</head>
<p>[Translated by the Rev. S. Thelwall.]</p>

 <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>Chapter I.—Of Heathen Repentance.</head>
<p>Repentance, men understand, so far as nature is able, to be an emotion of the mind
arising from disgust8421 at some previously cherished worse sentiment: that kind of men I
mean which even we ourselves were in days gone by—blind, without the Lord’s light. From
the reason of repentance, however, they are just as far as they are from the Author of reason
Himself. Reason, in fact, is a thing of God, inasmuch as there is nothing which God the
Maker of all has not provided, disposed, ordained by reason—nothing which He has not
willed should be handled and understood by reason. All, therefore, who are ignorant of God,
must necessarily be ignorant also of a thing which is His, because no treasure-house8422 at
all is accessible to strangers. And thus, voyaging all the universal course of life without the
rudder of reason, they know not how to shun the hurricane which is impending over the
world.8423 Moreover, how irrationally they behave in the practice of repentance, it will be
enough briefly to show just by this one fact, that they exercise it even in the case of their
good deeds. They repent of good faith, of love, of simple-heartedness, of patience, of mercy,
just in proportion as any deed prompted by these feelings has fallen on thankless soil. They
execrate their own selves for having done good; and that species chiefly of repentance which
is applied to the best works they fix in their heart, making it their care to remember never
again to do a good turn. On repentance for evil deeds, on the contrary, they lay lighter stress.
In short, they make this same (virtue) a means of sinning more readily than a means of rightdoing.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—True Repentance a Thing Divine, Originated by God, and Subject to
His Laws.</head>
<p>But if they acted as men who had any part in God, and thereby in reason also, they
would first weigh well the importance of repentance, and would never apply it in such a
way as to make it a ground for convicting themselves of perverse self-amendment. In short,
they would regulate the limit of their repentance, because they would reach (a limit) in sinning
too—by fearing God, I mean. But where there is no fear, in like manner there is no
amendment; where there is no amendment, repentance is of necessity vain, for it lacks the
fruit for which God sowed it; that is, man’s salvation. For God—after so many and so great
sins of human temerity, begun by the first of the race, Adam, after the condemnation of
man, together with the dowry of the world8424 after his ejection from paradise and subjection
to death—when He had hasted back to His own mercy, did from that time onward inaugurate
repentance in His own self, by rescinding the sentence of His first wrath, engaging to grant
pardon to His own work and image.8425 And so He gathered together a people for Himself,
and fostered them with many liberal distributions of His bounty, and, after so often finding
them most ungrateful, ever exhorted them to repentance and sent out the voices of the
universal company of the prophets to prophesy. By and by, promising freely the grace which
in the last times He was intending to pour as a flood of light on the universal world8426
through His Spirit, He bade the baptism of repentance lead the way, with the view of first
preparing,8427 by means of the sign and seal of repentance, them whom He was calling,
through grace, to (inherit) the promise surely made to Abraham. John holds not his peace,
saying, “Enter upon repentance, for now shall salvation approach the nations”8428—the
Lord, that is, bringing salvation according to God’s promise. To Him John, as His harbinger,
directed the repentance (which he preached), whose province was the purging of men’s
minds, that whatever defilement inveterate error had imparted, whatever contamination in
the heart of man ignorance had engendered, that repentance should sweep and scrape away,
and cast out of doors, and thus prepare the home of the heart, by making it clean, for the
Holy Spirit, who was about to supervene, that He might with pleasure introduce Himself
there-into, together with His celestial blessings. Of these blessings the title is briefly one—the
salvation of man—the abolition of former sins being the preliminary step. This8429 is the
(final) cause of repentance, this her work, in taking in hand the business of divine mercy.

What is profitable to man does service to God. The rule of repentance, however, which we
learn when we know the Lord, retains a definite form,—viz., that no violent hands so to
speak, be ever laid on good deeds or thoughts.8430 For God, never giving His sanction to
the reprobation of good deeds, inasmuch as they are His own (of which, being the author,
He must necessarily be the defender too), is in like manner the acceptor of them, and if the
acceptor, likewise the rewarder. Let, then, the ingratitude of men see to it,8431 if it attaches
repentance even to good works; let their gratitude see to it too, if the desire of earning it be
the incentive to well-doing: earthly and mortal are they each. For how small is your gain if
you do good to a grateful man! or your loss if to an ungrateful! A good deed has God as its
debtor, just as an evil has too; for a judge is rewarder of every cause. Well, since, God as
Judge presides over the exacting and maintaining8432 of justice, which to Him is most dear;
and since it is with an eye to justice that He appoints all the sum of His discipline, is there
room for doubting that, just as in all our acts universally, so also in the case of repentance,
justice must be rendered to God?—which duty can indeed only be fulfilled on the condition
that repentance be brought to bear only on sins. Further, no deed but an evil one deserves
to be called sin, nor does any one err by well-doing. But if he does not err, why does he invade
(the province of) repentance, the private ground of such as do err? Why does he impose on
his goodness a duty proper to wickedness? Thus it comes to pass that, when a thing is called
into play where it ought not, there, where it ought, it is neglected.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Sins May Be Divided into Corporeal and Spiritual. Both Equally Subject,
If Not to Human, Yet to Divine Investigation and Punishment.8433</head>
<p>What things, then, they be for which repentance seems just and due—that is, what things
are to be set down under the head of sin—the occasion indeed demands that I should note
down; but (to do so) may seem to be unnecessary. For when the Lord is known, our spirit,
having been “looked back upon”8434 by its own Author, emerges unbidden into the knowledge
of the truth; and being admitted to (an acquaintance with) the divine precepts, is by
them forthwith instructed that “that from which God bids us abstain is to be accounted
sin:” inasmuch as, since it is generally agreed that God is some great essence of good, of
course nothing but evil would be displeasing to good; in that, between things mutually
contrary, friendship there is none. Still it will not be irksome briefly to touch upon the
fact8435 that, of sins, some are carnal, that is, corporeal; some spiritual. For since man is
composed of this combination of a two-fold substance, the sources of his sins are no other
than the sources of his composition. But it is not the fact that body and spirit are two things
that constitute the sins mutually different—otherwise they are on this account rather equal,
because the two make up one—lest any make the distinction between their sins proportionate
to the difference between their substances, so as to esteem the one lighter, or else heavier,
than the other: if it be true, (as it is,) that both flesh and spirit are creatures of God; one
wrought by His hand, one consummated by His afflatus. Since, then, they equally pertain
to the Lord, whichever of them sins equally offends the Lord. Is it for you to distinguish the
acts of the flesh and the spirit, whose communion and conjunction in life, in death, and in
resurrection, are so intimate, that “at that time”8436 they are equally raised up either for life
or else for judgment; because, to wit, they have equally either sinned or lived innocently?
This we would (once for all) premise, in order that we may understand that no less necessity
for repentance is incumbent on either part of man, if in anything it have sinned, than on
both. The guilt of both is common; common, too, is the Judge—God to wit; common,
therefore, is withal the healing medicine of repentance. The source whence sins are named
“spiritual” and “corporeal” is the fact that every sin is matter either of act or else of thought:
so that what is in deed is “corporeal,” because a deed, like a body, is capable of being seen
and touched; what is in the mind is “spiritual,” because spirit is neither seen nor handled: by
which consideration is shown that sins not of deed only, but of will too, are to be shunned,

and by repentance purged. For if human finitude8437 judges only sins of deed, because it is
not equal to (piercing) the lurking-places of the will, let us not on that account make light
of crimes of the will in God’s sight. God is all-sufficient. Nothing from whence any sin
whatsoever proceeds is remote from His sight; because He is neither ignorant, nor does He
omit to decree it to judgment. He is no dissembler of, nor double-dealer with,8438 His own
clear-sightedness. What (shall we say of the fact) that will is the origin of deed? For if any
sins are imputed to chance, or to necessity, or to ignorance, let them see to themselves: if
these be excepted, there is no sinning save by will. Since, then, will is the origin of deed, is
it not so much the rather amenable to penalty as it is first in guilt? Nor, if some difficulty
interferes with its full accomplishment, is it even in that case exonerated; for it is itself imputed
to itself: nor; having done the work which lay in its own power, will it be excusable
by reason of that miscarriage of its accomplishment. In fact, how does the Lord demonstrate
Himself as adding a superstructure to the Law, except by interdicting sins of the will as well
(as other sins); while He defines not only the man who had actually invaded another’s
wedlock to be an adulterer, but likewise him who had contaminated (a woman) by the
concupiscence of his gaze?8439 Accordingly it is dangerous enough for the mind to set before
itself what it is forbidden to perform, and rashly through the will to perfect its execution.
And since the power of this will is such that, even without fully sating its self-gratification,
it stands for a deed; as a deed, therefore, it shall be punished. It is utterly vain to say, “I willed,
but yet I did not.” Rather you ought to carry the thing through, because you will; or else not
to will, because you do not carry it through. But, by the confession of your consciousness,
you pronounce your own condemnation. For if you eagerly desired a good thing, you would
have been anxious to carry it through; in like manner, as you do not carry an evil thing
through, you ought not to have eagerly desired it. Wherever you take your stand, you are
fast bound by guilt; because you have either willed evil, or else have not fulfilled good.</p>

Only, Nor Chiefly, for the Good It Brings, But Because God Commands It.</head>
<p>To all sins, then, committed whether by flesh or spirit, whether by deed or will, the same
God who has destined penalty by means of judgment, has withal engaged to grant pardon
by means of repentance, saying to the people, “Repent thee, and I will save thee;”8440 and
again, “I live, saith the Lord, and I will (have) repentance rather than death.”8441 Repentance,
then, is “life,” since it is preferred to “death.” That repentance, O sinner, like myself (nay,
rather, less than myself, for pre-eminence in sins I acknowledge to be mine8442), do you so
hasten to, so embrace, as a shipwrecked man the protection8443 of some plank. This will
draw you forth when sunk in the waves of sins, and will bear you forward into the port of
the divine clemency. Seize the opportunity of unexpected felicity: that you, who sometime
were in God’s sight nothing but “a drop of a bucket,”8444 and “dust of the threshingfloor,”
8445 and “a potter’s vessel,”8446 may thenceforward become that “tree which is sown
beside8447 the waters, is perennial in leaves, bears fruit at its own time,”8448 and shall not
see “fire,”8449 nor “axe.”8450 Having found “the truth,”8451 repent of errors; repent of having
loved what God loves not: even we ourselves do not permit our slave-lads not to hate the
things which are offensive to us; for the principle of voluntary obedience8452 consists in
similarity of minds.</p>
<p>To reckon up the good, of repentance, the subject-matter is copious, and therefore
should be committed to great eloquence. Let us, however, in proportion to our narrow
abilities, inculcate one point,—that what God enjoins is good and best. I hold it audacity to
dispute about the “good” of a divine precept; for, indeed, it is not the fact that it is good

obedience the majesty of divine power has the prior8453 right; the authority of Him who
commands is prior to the utility of him who serves. “Is it good to repent, or no?” Why do
you ponder? God enjoins; nay, He not merely enjoins, but likewise exhorts. He invites by
(offering) reward—salvation, to wit; even by an oath, saying “I live,”8454 He desires that
credence may be given Him. Oh blessed we, for whose sake God swears! Oh most miserable,
if we believe not the Lord even when He swears! What, therefore, God so highly commends,
what He even (after human fashion) attests on oath, we are bound of course to approach,
and to guard with the utmost seriousness; that, abiding permanently in (the faith of) the

<head>Chapter V.—Sin Never to Be Returned to After Repentance.8457</head>
<p>For what I say is this, that the repentance which, being shown us and commanded us
through God’s grace, recalls us to grace8458 with the Lord, when once learned and undertaken
by us ought never afterward to be cancelled by repetition of sin. No pretext of ignorance
now remains to plead on your behalf; in that, after acknowledging the Lord, and accepting
His precepts8459—in short, after engaging in repentance of (past) sins—you again betake
yourself to sins. Thus, in as far as you are removed from ignorance, in so far are you cemented8460
to contumacy. For if the ground on which you had repented of having sinned was
that you had begun to fear the Lord, why have you preferred to rescind what you did for
fear’s sake, except because you have ceased to fear? For there is no other thing but contumacy
which subverts fear. Since there is no exception which defends from liability to penalty
even such as are ignorant of the Lord—because ignorance of God, openly as He is set before
men, and comprehensible as He is even on the score of His heavenly benefits, is not possible8461—
how perilous is it for Him to be despised when known? Now, that man does
despise Him, who, after attaining by His help to an understanding of things good and evil,
often an affront to his own understanding—that is, to God’s gift—by resuming what he
understands ought to be shunned, and what he has already shunned: he rejects the Giver
in abandoning the gift; he denies the Benefactor in not honouring the benefit. How can he
be pleasing to Him, whose gift is displeasing to himself? Thus he is shown to be not only
contumacious toward the Lord, but likewise ungrateful. Besides, that man commits no light
sin against the Lord, who, after he had by repentance renounced His rival the devil, and had
under this appellation subjected him to the Lord, again upraises him by his own return (to
the enemy), and makes himself a ground of exultation to him; so that the Evil One, with his
prey recovered, rejoices anew against the Lord. Does he not—what is perilous even to say,
but must be put forward with a view to edification—place the devil before the Lord? For he
seems to have made the comparison who has known each; and to have judicially pronounced
him to be the better whose (servant) he has preferred again to be. Thus he who, through
repentance for sins, had begun to make satisfaction to the Lord, will, through another re-

satisfied if He be looked up to with the heart and the mind, even if this be not done in outward

violate wedlock without damage to their chastity; they mingle poison for their parent without
damage to their filial duty! Thus, then, they will themselves withal be thrust down into hell
without damage to their pardon, while they sin without damage to their fear! Here is a
primary example of perversity: they sin, because they fear!8462 I suppose, if they feared not,
they would not sin! Let him, therefore, who would not have God offended not revere Him

from the seed of hypocrites, whose friendship with the devil is indivisible, whose repentance

<head>Chapter VI.—Baptism Not to Be Presumptously Received. It Requires Preceding
Repentance, Manifested by Amendment of Life.</head>
<p>Whatever, then, our poor ability has attempted to suggest with reference to laying hold
of repentance once for all, and perpetually retaining it, does indeed bear upon all who are
given up to the Lord, as being all competitors for salvation in earning the favour of God;
but is chiefly urgent in the case of those young novices who are only just beginning to bedew8464
their ears with divine discourses, and who, as whelps in yet early infancy, and with
eyes not yet perfect, creep about uncertainly, and say indeed that they renounce their former
deed, and assume (the profession of) repentance, but neglect to complete it.8465 For the very
end of desiring importunes them to desire somewhat of their former deeds; just as fruits,
when they are already beginning to turn into the sourness or bitterness of age, do yet still
in some part flatter8466 their own loveliness. Moreover, a presumptuous confidence in
baptism introduces all kind of vicious delay and tergiversation with regard to repentance;
for, feeling sure of undoubted pardon of their sins, men meanwhile steal the intervening
time, and make it for themselves into a holiday-time8467 for sinning, rather than a time for
learning not to sin. Further, how inconsistent is it to expect pardon of sins (to be granted)
to a repentance which they have not fulfilled! This is to hold out your hand for merchandise,
but not produce the price. For repentance is the price at which the Lord has determined to
award pardon: He proposes the redemption8468 of release from penalty at this compensating
exchange of repentance. If, then, sellers first examine the coin with which they make their
bargains, to see whether it be cut, or scraped, or adulterated,8469 we believe likewise that
the Lord, when about to make us the grant of so costly merchandise, even of eternal life,
first institutes a probation of our repentance. “But meanwhile let us defer the reality of our
repentance: it will then, I suppose, be clear that we are amended when we are absolved.”8470
By no means; (but our amendment should be manifested) while, pardon being in abeyance,
there is still a prospect of penalty; while the penitent does not yet merit—so far as merit we
can—his liberation; while God is threatening, not while He is forgiving. For what slave, after
his position has been changed by reception of freedom, charges himself with his (past) thefts
and desertions? What soldier, after his discharge, makes satisfaction for his (former) brands?

<pb n="1472"/>
A sinner is bound to bemoan himself before receiving pardon, because the time of repentance
is coincident with that of peril and of fear. Not that I deny that the divine benefit—the putting
away of sins, I mean—is in every way sure to such as are on the point of entering the (baptismal)
water; but what we have to labour for is, that it may be granted us to attain that
blessing. For who will grant to you, a man of so faithless repentance, one single sprinkling
of any water whatever? To approach it by stealth, indeed, and to get the minister appointed
over this business misled by your asseverations, is easy; but God takes foresight for His own
treasure, and suffers not the unworthy to steal a march upon it. What, in fact, does He say?
“Nothing hid which shall not be revealed.”8471 Draw whatever (veil of) darkness you please
over your deeds, “God is light.”8472 But some think as if God were under a necessity of bestowing
even on the unworthy, what He has engaged (to give); and they turn His liberality
into slavery. But if it is of necessity that God grants us the symbol of death,8473 then He does
so unwillingly. But who permits a gift to be permanently retained which he has granted
unwillingly? For do not many afterward fall out of (grace)? is not this gift taken away from
many? These, no doubt, are they who do steal a march upon (the treasure), who, after approaching
to the faith of repentance, set up on the sands a house doomed to ruin. Let no
one, then, flatter himself on the ground of being assigned to the “recruit-classes” of learners,
as if on that account he have a licence even now to sin. As soon as you “know the Lord,”8474
you should fear Him; as soon as you have gazed on Him, you should reverence Him. But
what difference does your “knowing” Him make, while you rest in the same practises as in
days bygone, when you knew Him not? What, moreover, is it which distinguishes you from
a perfected8475 servant of God? Is there one Christ for the baptized, another for the learners?
Have they some different hope or reward? some different dread of judgment? some different
necessity for repentance? That baptismal washing is a sealing of faith, which faith is begun
and is commended by the faith of repentance. We are not washed in order that we may cease
sinning, but because we have ceased, since in heart we have been bathed8476 already. For
the first baptism of a learner is this, a perfect fear;8477 thenceforward, in so far as you have
understanding of the Lord faith is sound, the conscience having once for all embraced repentance.
Otherwise, if it is (only) after the baptismal waters that we cease sinning, it is of
necessity, not of free-will, that we put on innocence. Who, then, is pre-eminent in goodness?

he who is not allowed, or he whom it displeases, to be evil? he who is bidden, or he whose
pleasure it is, to be free from crime? Let us, then, neither keep our hands from theft unless
the hardness of bars withstand us, nor refrain our eyes from the concupiscence of fornication
unless we be withdrawn by guardians of our persons, if no one who has surrendered himself
to the Lord is to cease sinning unless he be bound thereto by baptism. But if any entertain
this sentiment, I know not whether he, after baptism, do not feel more sadness to think that
he has ceased from sinning, than gladness that he hath escaped from it. And so it is becoming
that learners desire baptism, but do not hastily receive it: for he who desires it, honours it;
he who hastily receives it, disdains it: in the one appears modesty, in the other arrogance;
the former satisfies, the latter neglects it; the former covets to merit it, but the latter promises
it to himself as a due return; the former takes, the latter usurps it. Whom would you judge
worthier, except one who is more amended? whom more amended, except one who is more
timid, and on that account has fulfilled the duty of true repentance? for he has feared to
continue still in sin, lest he should not merit the reception of baptism. But the hasty receiver,
inasmuch as he promised it himself (as his due), being forsooth secure (of obtaining it),
could not fear: thus he fulfilled not repentance either, because he lacked the instrumental
agent of repentance, that is, fear.8478 Hasty reception is the portion of irreverence; it inflates
the seeker, it despises the Giver. And thus it sometimes deceives,8479 for it promises to itself
the gift before it be due; whereby He who is to furnish the gift is ever offended.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—Of Repentance, in the Case of Such as Have Lapsed After Baptism.</head>
<p>So long, Lord Christ, may the blessing of learning or hearing concerning the discipline
of repentance be granted to Thy servants, as is likewise behoves them, while learners,8480
not to sin; in other words, may they thereafter know nothing of repentance, and require
nothing of it. It is irksome to append mention of a second—nay, in that case, the
last—hope;8481 lest, by treating of a remedial repenting yet in reserve, we seem to be pointing
to a yet further space for sinning. Far be it that any one so interpret our meaning, as if, because
there is an opening for repenting, there were even now, on that account, an opening
for sinning; and as if the redundance of celestial clemency constituted a licence for human
temerity. Let no one be less good because God is more so, by repeating his sin as often as
he is forgiven. Otherwise be sure he will find an end of escaping, when he shall not find one
of sinning. We have escaped once: thus far and no farther let us commit ourselves to perils,
even if we seem likely to escape a second time.8482 Men in general, after escaping shipwreck,
thenceforward declare divorce with ship and sea; and by cherishing the memory of the
danger, honour the benefit conferred by God,—their deliverance, namely. I praise their fear,
I love their reverence; they are unwilling a second time to be a burden to the divine mercy;
they fear to seem to trample on the benefit which they have attained; they shun, with a solicitude
which at all events is good, to make trial a second time of that which they have once
learned to fear. Thus the limit of their temerity is the evidence of their fear.</p>
<p>Moreover, man’s fear8483 is an honour to God. But however, that most stubborn foe
(of ours) never gives his malice leisure; indeed, he is then most savage when he fully feels
that a man is freed from his clutches; he then flames fiercest while he is fast becoming extinguished.
Grieve and groan he must of necessity over the fact that, by the grant of pardon,
so many works of death8484 in man have been overthrown, so many marks of the condem-
nation which formerly was his own erased. He grieves that that sinner, (now) Christ’s servant,
is destined to judge him and his angels.8485 And so he observes, assaults, besieges him, in
the hope that he may be able in some way either to strike his eyes with carnal concupiscence,
or else to entangle his mind with worldly enticements, or else to subvert his faith by fear of
earthly power, or else to wrest him from the sure way by perverse traditions: he is never

had received. If the Lord’s indulgence grants you the means of restoring what you had lost,
be thankful for the benefit renewed, not to say amplified; for restoring is a greater thing than
giving, inasmuch as having lost is more miserable than never having received at all. However,
if any do incur the debt of a second repentance, his spirit is not to be forthwith cut down
and undermined by despair. Let it by all means be irksome to sin again, but let not to repent
again be irksome: irksome to imperil one’s self again, but not to be again set free. Let none

and “eating of things sacrificed to idols;”8492 accuses the Sardians of “works not
full;”8493 censures the Pergamenes for teaching perverse things;8494 upbraids the Laodiceans
for trusting to their riches;8495 and yet gives them all general monitions to repentance—under
comminations, it is true; but He would not utter comminations to one unrepentant if He
did not forgive the repentant. The matter were doubtful if He had not withal elsewhere
demonstrated this profusion of His clemency. Saith He not,8496 “He who hath fallen shall
rise again, and he who hath been averted shall be converted?” He it is, indeed, who “would
have mercy rather than sacrifices.”8497 The heavens, and the angels who are there, are glad
at a man’s repentance.8498 Ho! you sinner, be of good cheer! you see where it is that there
is joy at your return. What meaning for us have those themes of the Lord’s parables? Is not
the fact that a woman has lost a drachma, and seeks it and finds it, and invites her female
friends to share her joy, an example of a restored sinner?8499 There strays, withal, one little
ewe of the shepherd’s; but the flock was not more dear than the one: that one is earnestly
sought; the one is longed for instead of all; and at length she is found, and is borne back on
the shoulders of the shepherd himself; for much had she toiled8500 in straying.8501 That
most gentle father, likewise, I will not pass over in silence, who calls his prodigal son home,
and willingly receives him repentant after his indigence, slays his best fatted calf, and graces
his joy with a banquet.8502 Why not? He had found the son whom he had lost; he had felt
him to be all the dearer of whom he had made a gain. Who is that father to be understood

<head>Chapter IX.—Concerning the Outward Manifestations by Which This Second Repentance
is to Be Accompanied.</head>
<p>The narrower, then, the sphere of action of this second and only (remaining) repentance,
the more laborious is its probation; in order that it may not be exhibited in the conscience
alone, but may likewise be carried out in some (external) act. This act, which is more usually
expressed and commonly spoken of under a Greek name, is ἐξομολόγησις ,8506 whereby
we confess our sins to the Lord, not indeed as if He were ignorant of them, but inasmuch
as by confession satisfaction is settled,8507 of confession repentance is born; by repentance
God is appeased. And thus exomologesis is a discipline for man’s prostration and humiliation,
enjoining a demeanor calculated to move mercy. With regard also to the very dress and
food, it commands (the penitent) to lie in sackcloth and ashes, to cover his body in
mourning,8508 to lay his spirit low in sorrows, to exchange for severe treatment the sins
which he has committed; moreover, to know no food and drink but such as is plain,—not
for the stomach’s sake, to wit, but the soul’s; for the most part, however, to feed prayers on
fastings, to groan, to weep and make outcries8509 unto the Lord your8510 God; to bow before
the feet of the presbyters, and kneel to God’s dear ones; to enjoin on all the brethren to be
ambassadors to bear his8511 deprecatory supplication (before God). All this exomologesis
(does), that it may enhance repentance; may honour God by its fear of the (incurred) danger;
may, by itself pronouncing against the sinner, stand in the stead of God’s indignation, and
by temporal mortification (I will not say frustrate, but) expunge eternal punishments.
Therefore, while it abases the man, it raises him; while it covers him with squalor, it renders
him more clean; while it accuses, it excuses; while it condemns, it absolves. The less quarter
you give yourself, the more (believe me) will God give you.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—Of Men’s Shrinking from This Second Repentance and Exomologesis,
and of the Unreasonableness of Such Shrinking.</head>
<p>Yet most men either shun this work, as being a public exposure8512 of themselves, or
else defer it from day to day. I presume (as being) more mindful of modesty than of salvation;
just like men who, having contracted some malady in the more private parts of the body,
avoid the privity of physicians, and so perish with their own bashfulness. It is intolerable,
forsooth, to modesty to make satisfaction to the offended Lord! to be restored to its forfeited8513
salvation! Truly you are honourable in your modesty; bearing an open forehead
for sinning, but an abashed one for deprecating! I give no place to bashfulness when I am
a gainer by its loss; when itself in some son exhorts the man, saying, “Respect not me; it is
better that I perish through8514 you, i.e. than you through me.” At all events, the time when
(if ever) its danger is serious, is when it is a butt for jeering speech in the presence of insulters,
where one man raises himself on his neighbour’s ruin, where there is upward clambering
over the prostrate. But among brethren and fellow-servants, where there is common hope,
fear,8515 joy, grief, suffering, because there is a common Spirit from a common Lord and
Father, why do you think these brothers to be anything other than yourself? Why flee from
the partners of your own mischances, as from such as will derisively cheer them? The body
cannot feel gladness at the trouble of any one member,8516 it must necessarily join with one
consent in the grief, and in labouring for the remedy. In a company of two8517 is the
church;8518 but the church is Christ.8519 When, then, you cast yourself at the brethren’s
knees, you are handling Christ, you are entreating Christ. In like manner, when they shed
tears over you, it is Christ who suffers, Christ who prays the Father for mercy. What a son8520
asks is ever easily obtained. Grand indeed is the reward of modesty, which the concealment
of our fault promises us! to wit, if we do hide somewhat from the knowledge of man, shall
we equally conceal it from God? Are the judgment of men and the knowledge of God so
put upon a par? Is it better to be damned in secret than absolved in public? But you say, “It

where repentance is to be made, the misery ceases, because it is turned into something
salutary. Miserable it is to be cut, and cauterized, and racked with the pungency of some

<p>What if, besides the shame which they make the most account of, men dread likewise
the bodily inconveniences; in that, unwashen, sordidly attired, estranged from gladness,
they must spend their time in the roughness of sackcloth, and the horridness of ashes, and
the sunkenness of face caused by fasting? Is it then becoming for us to supplicate for our
sins in scarlet and purple? Hasten hither with the pin for panning the hair, and the powder
for polishing the teeth, and some forked implement of steel or brass for cleaning the nails.
Whatever of false brilliance, whatever of feigned redness, is to be had, let him diligently apply
it to his lips or cheeks. Let him furthermore seek out baths of more genial temperature in
some gardened or seaside retreat; let him enlarge his expenses; let him carefully seek the
rarest delicacy of fatted fowls; let him refine his old wine: and when any shall ask him, “On
whom are you lavishing all this?” let him say, “I have sinned against God, and am in peril
of eternally perishing: and so now I am drooping, and wasting and torturing myself, that I
may reconcile God to myself, whom by sinning I have offended.” Why, they who go about
canvassing for the obtaining of civil office, feel it neither degrading nor irksome to struggle,
in behalf of such their desires, with annoyances to soul and body; and not annoyances
merely, but likewise contumelies of all kinds. What meannesses of dress do they not affect?
what houses do they not beset with early and late visits?—bowing whenever they meet any
high personage, frequenting no banquets, associating in no entertainments, but voluntarily
exiled from the felicity of freedom and festivity: and all that for the sake of the fleeting joy
of a single year! Do we hesitate, when eternity is at stake, to endure what the competitor for
consulship or prætorship puts up with?8522 and shall we be tardy in offering to the offended
Lord a self-chastisement in food and raiment, which8523 Gentiles lay upon themselves when
they have offended no one at all? Such are they of whom Scripture makes mention: “Woe

<head>Chapter XII.—Final Considerations to Induce to Exomologesis.</head>
<p>If you shrink back from exomologesis, consider in your heart the hell,8525 which exomologesis
will extinguish for you; and imagine first the magnitude of the penalty, that you may
not hesitate about the adoption of the remedy. What do we esteem that treasure-house of
eternal fire to be, when small vent-holes8526 of it rouse such blasts of flames that neighbouring
cities either are already no more, or are in daily expectation of the same fate? The haughtiest8527
mountains start asunder in the birth-throes of their inly-gendered fire; and—which
proves to us the perpetuity of the judgment—though they start asunder, though they be
devoured, yet come they never to an end. Who will not account these occasional punishments
inflicted on the mountains as examples of the judgment which menaces the impenitent?
Who will not agree that such sparks are but some few missiles and sportive darts of some
inestimably vast centre of fire? Therefore, since you know that after the first bulwarks of
the Lord’s baptism8528 there still remains for you, in exomologesis a second reserve of aid
against hell, why do you desert your own salvation? Why are you tardy to approach what
you know heals you? Even dumb irrational animals recognise in their time of need the
medicines which have been divinely assigned them. The stag, transfixed by the arrow, knows
that, to force out the steel, and its inextricable lingerings, he must heal himself with dittany.
The swallow, if she blinds her young, knows how to give them eyes again by means of her
own swallow-wort.8529 Shall the sinner, knowing that exomologesis has been instituted by
the Lord for his restoration, pass that by which restored the Babylonian king8530 to his
realms? Long time had he offered to the Lord his repentance, working out his exomologesis
by a seven years’ squalor, with his nails wildly growing after the eagle’s fashion, and his
unkempt hair wearing the shagginess of a lion. Hard handling! Him whom men were
shuddering at, God was receiving back. But, on the other hand, the Egyptian emperor—who,
after pursuing the once afflicted people of God, long denied to their Lord, rushed into the
battle8531—did, after so many warning plagues, perish in the parted sea, (which was permitted

 <p>I.
(Such as have lapsed, cap. vii. p. 660.)</p>
<p>The penitential system of the Primitive days, referred to in our author, began to be
changed when less public confessions were authorized, on account of the scandals which
publicity generated. Changes were as follows:</p>
<p>1. A grave presbyter was appointed to receive and examine voluntary penitents as the
Penitentiary of a diocese, and to suspend or reconcile them with due solemnities—circa a.d.
250.</p>
<p>2. This plan also became encumbered with difficulties and was abolished in the East,
circa a.d. 400.</p>
<p>3. A discipline similar to that of the Anglican Church (which is but loosely maintained
therein) succeeded, under St. Chrysostom; who frequently maintains the sufficiency of
confession according to Matt. vi. 6. A Gallican author8538 says—“this is the period regarded
by historians as the most brilliant in Church history. At the close of the fourth century, in
the great churches of the Orient, sixty thousand Christians received the Eucharistic communion,
in one day, in both kinds, with no other than their private confessions to Almighty
God. The scandalous evil-liver alone was repelled from the Eucharistic Table.” This continued
till circa a.d. 700.</p>
<p>4. Particular, but voluntary confessions were now made in the East and West, but with
widely various acceptance under local systems of discipline. The absolutions were precatory:
“may God absolve Thee.” This lasted, even in the West, till the compulsory system of the
Lateran Council, a.d. 1215.</p>
<p>5. Since this date, so far as the West is concerned, the whole system of corrupt casuistry
and enforced confession adopted in the West has utterly destroyed the Primitive doctrine
and discipline as to sin and its remedy wherever it prevails. In the East, private confession
exists in a system wholly different and one which maintains the Primitive Theology and the
Scriptural principle. (1) It is voluntary; (2) it is free from the corrupt system of the casuists;
(3) it distinguishes between Ecclesiastical Absolution and that of Him who alone “seeth in
<note type="footnote">8538 Le Confesseur, par L’Abbé * * * p. 15, Brussels 1866.</note>

<pb n="1485"/>
secret;” (4) it admits no compromise with attrition, but exacts the contrite heart and the
firm resolve to go and sin no more, and (5) finally, it employs a most guarded and Evangelical
formula of remission, of which see Elucidation IV.</p>

 <p>II.
(The last hope, cap. vii. p. 662.)</p>
<p>How absolutely the Lateran Council has overthrown the Primitive discipline is here
made manifest. The spirit of the latter is expressed by our author in language which almost
prompts to despair. It makes sin “exceeding sinful” and even Ecclesiastical forgiveness the
reverse of easy. The Lateran System of enforced Confession makes sin easy and restoration
to a sinless state equally so: a perpetual resort to the confessor being the only condition for
evil living, and a chronic state of pardon and peace. But, let the Greek Church be heard in
this matter, rather than an Anglican Catholic. I refer to Macarius, Bishop of Vinnitza and
Rector of the Theological Academy of St. Petersburg, as follows:8539 “It is requisite (for the
effective reception of Absolution) at least according to the teaching of the Orthodox Church
of the Orient, that the following conditions be observed: (1) Contrition for sins, is in the
very nature of Penitence, indispensable; (2), consequently, there must be a firm resolution
to reform the life; (3) also, faith in Christ and hope in his mercy, with (4) auricular confession
before the priest.” He allows that this latter condition was not primitive, but was a maternal
concession to penitents of later date: this, however, is voluntary, and of a widely different
form from that of the Latin, as will appear below in Elucidation IV.</p>
<p>Now, he contrasts with this the system of Rome, and condemns it, on overwhelming
considerations. 1. It makes penances compensations8540 or “satisfaction,” offered for sins
to divine Justice, this (he says) “is in contradiction with the Christian doctrine of justification,
the Scripture teaching one full and entire satisfaction for the sins of the whole human race,
once for all presented by our Lord Jesus Christ. This doctrine is equally in conflict with the
entire teaching of the Primitive Church.”</p>
<p>2. It introduces a false system of indulgences, as the consequence of its false premisses.</p>
<p>3. He demonstrates the insufficiency of attrition, which respects the fear of punishment,
and not sin itself. But the Council of Trent affirms the sufficiency of attrition, and permits
the confessor to absolve the attrite. Needless to say, the masses accept this wide gate and
broad way to salvation rather than the strait gate and narrow way of hating sin and reforming
the life, in obedience to the Gospel.</p>

(Among brethren, cap. x., p. 662.)</p>
<p>A controversial writer has lately complained that Bp. Kaye speaks of the public confession
treated of by our author in this work, and adds—“Tertullian nowhere used the word public.”
The answer is that he speaks of the discipline of Exomologesis, which was, in its own nature,
as public as preaching. A Gallican writer, less inclined to Jesuitism in the use of words, says
frankly: “When one studies this question, with the documents before his eyes, it is impossible
not to confess that the Primitive discipline of the Church exhibits not a vestige of the auricular
confession afterwards introduced.” See Irenæus, Adv. Hæres. Vol. I. p. 335, this Series.
The Lii. of the canons called Apostolical, reflects a very simple view of the matter, in these
words: “If any Bishop or Presbyter will not receive one who turns from his sins, but casts
him out, let him be deposed: for he grieves Christ, who said, There shall be joy in heaven
over one sinner that repenteth.” The ascetic spirit of our author seems at war with that of
this Canon.</p>

 <p>IV.
(Exomologesis, cap. xii., p. 663.)</p>
<p>To this day, in the Oriental Churches, the examination of the presbyter who hears the
voluntary confession of penitents, is often very primitive in its forms and confined to general
inquiries under the Decalogue. The Casuistry of (Dens and Liguori) the Western
Schemata Practica has not defiled our Eastern brethren to any great extent.</p>
<p>In the office8541 (᾽Ακολουθία τῶν ἐξομολουγουμένων) we have a simple and beautiful
form of prayer and supplication in which the following is the formula of Absolution: “My
Spiritual child, who hast confessed to my humility, I, unworthy and a sinner, have not the
power to forgive sins on Earth; God only can: and through that Divine voice which came to
the Apostles, after the Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, saying—‘Whosoever sins, etc.,’
we, therein confiding, say—Whatsoever thou hast confessed to my extreme humility, and
whatsoever thou hast omitted to say, either through ignorance or forgetfulness, God forgive
thee in this present world and in that which is to come.”</p>
<p>The plural (We therein confiding) is significant and a token of Primitive doctrine: i.e.
of confession before the whole Church, (2 Cor. ii. 10): and note the precatory form—“God
forgive thee.” The perilous form Ego te absolvo is not Catholic: it dates from the thirteenth
century and is used in the West only. It is not wholly dropped from the Anglican Office,
but has been omitted from the American Prayer-Book.</p>

without any considerable novelty of preparation, finally, without expense, a man is dipped
in water, and amid the utterance of some few words, is sprinkled, and then rises again, not
much (or not at all) the cleaner, the consequent attainment of eternity8546 is esteemed the
more incredible. I am a deceiver if, on the contrary, it is not from their circumstance, and
preparation, and expense, that idols’ solemnities or mysteries get their credit and authority
built up. Oh, miserable incredulity, which quite deniest to God His own properties, simplicity
and power! What then? Is it not wonderful, too, that death should be washed away by
bathing? But it is the more to be believed if the wonderfulness be the reason why it is not
believed. For what does it behove divine works to be in their quality, except that they be
above all wonder?8547 We also ourselves wonder, but it is because we believe. Incredulity,
on the other hand, wonders, but does not believe: for the simple acts it wonders at, as if they
were vain; the grand results, as if they were impossible. And grant that it be just as you
think8548 sufficient to meet each point is the divine declaration which has forerun: “The
foolish things of the world hath God elected to confound its wisdom;”8549 and, “The things
very difficult with men are easy with God.”8550 For if God is wise and powerful (which even
they who pass Him by do not deny), it is with good reason that He lays the material causes
of His own operation in the contraries of wisdom and of power, that is, in foolishness and
impossibility; since every virtue receives its cause from those things by which it is called
forth.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Water Chosen as a Vehicle of Divine Operation and Wherefore. Its
Prominence First of All in Creation.</head>
<p>Mindful of this declaration as of a conclusive prescript, we nevertheless proceed to treat
the question, “How foolish and impossible it is to be formed anew by water. In what respect,
pray, has this material substance merited an office of so high dignity?” The authority, I
suppose, of the liquid element has to be examined.8551 This8552 however, is found in
abundance, and that from the very beginning. For water is one of those things which, before
all the furnishing of the world, were quiescent with God in a yet unshapen8553 state. “In the
first beginning,” saith Scripture, “God made the heaven and the earth. But the earth was
invisible, and unorganized,8554 and darkness was over the abyss; and the Spirit of the Lord
was hovering8555 over the waters.”8556 The first thing, O man, which you have to venerate,
is the age of the waters in that their substance is ancient; the second, their dignity, in that
they were the seat of the Divine Spirit, more pleasing to Him, no doubt, than all the other
then existing elements. For the darkness was total thus far, shapeless, without the ornament
of stars; and the abyss gloomy; and the earth unfurnished; and the heaven unwrought: water8557
alone—always a perfect, gladsome, simple material substance, pure in itself—supplied
a worthy vehicle to God. What of the fact that waters were in some way the regulating
powers by which the disposition of the world thenceforward was constituted by God? For
the suspension of the celestial firmament in the midst He caused by “dividing the waters;”8558
the suspension of “the dry land” He accomplished by “separating the waters.” After the
world had been hereupon set in order through its elements, when inhabitants were given
it, “the waters” were the first to receive the precept “to bring forth living creatures.”8559
Water was the first to produce that which had life, that it might be no wonder in baptism
if waters know how to give life.8560 For was not the work of fashioning man himself also
achieved with the aid of waters? Suitable material is found in the earth, yet not apt for the
purpose unless it be moist and juicy; which (earth) “the waters,” separated the fourth day

If, from that time onward, I go forward in recounting universally, or at more length, the
evidences of the “authority” of this element which I can adduce to show how great is its
power or its grace; how many ingenious devices, how many functions, how useful an instrumentality,
it affords the world, I fear I may seem to have collected rather the praises of water
than the reasons of baptism; although I should thereby teach all the more fully, that it is not
to be doubted that God has made the material substance which He has disposed throughout
all His products8561 and works, obey Him also in His own peculiar sacraments; that the
material substance which governs terrestrial life acts as agent likewise in the celestial.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—The Primeval Hovering of the Spirit of God Over the Waters Typical of Baptism. The Universal Element of Water Thus Made a Channel of Sanctification.
Resemblance Between the Outward Sign and the Inward Grace.</head>
<p>But it will suffice to have thus called at the outset those points in which withal is recognised
that primary principle of baptism,—which was even then fore-noted by the very attitude
assumed for a type of baptism,—that the Spirit of God, who hovered over (the waters) from
the beginning, would continue to linger over the waters of the baptized.8562 But a holy thing,
of course, hovered over a holy; or else, from that which hovered over that which was hovered
over borrowed a holiness, since it is necessary that in every case an underlying material
substance should catch the quality of that which overhangs it, most of all a corporeal of a
spiritual, adapted (as the spiritual is) through the subtleness of its substance, both for penetrating
and insinuating. Thus the nature of the waters, sanctified by the Holy One, itself
conceived withal the power of sanctifying. Let no one say, “Why then, are we, pray, baptized
with the very waters which then existed in the first beginning?” Not with those waters, of
course, except in so far as the genus indeed is one, but the species very many. But what is an
attribute to the genus reappears8563 likewise in the species. And accordingly it makes no
difference whether a man be washed in a sea or a pool, a stream or a fount, a lake or a
trough;8564 nor is there any distinction between those whom John baptized in the Jordan
and those whom Peter baptized in the Tiber, unless withal the eunuch whom Philip baptized
in the midst of his journeys with chance water, derived (therefrom) more or less of salvation
than others.8565 All waters, therefore, in virtue of the pristine privilege of their origin, do,
after invocation of God, attain the sacramental power of sanctification; for the Spirit immediately
supervenes from the heavens, and rests over the waters, sanctifying them from
Himself; and being thus sanctified, they imbibe at the same time the power of sanctifying.
Albeit the similitude may be admitted to be suitable to the simple act; that, since we are defiled
by sins, as it were by dirt, we should be washed from those stains in waters. But as sins do
not show themselves in our flesh (inasmuch as no one carries on his skin the spot of idolatry,
or fornication, or fraud), so persons of that kind are foul in the spirit, which is the author
of the sin; for the spirit is lord, the flesh servant. Yet they each mutually share the guilt: the
spirit, on the ground of command; the flesh, of subservience. Therefore, after the waters
have been in a manner endued with medicinal virtue8566 through the intervention of the

<head>Chapter V.—Use Made of Water by the Heathen. Type of the Angel at the Pool of
Bethsaida.8568</head>
<p>“Well, but the nations, who are strangers to all understanding of spiritual powers, ascribe
to their idols the imbuing of waters with the self-same efficacy.” (So they do) but they cheat
themselves with waters which are widowed.8569 For washing is the channel through which
they are initiated into some sacred rites—of some notorious Isis or Mithras. The gods
themselves likewise they honour by washings. Moreover, by carrying water around, and
sprinkling it, they everywhere expiate8570 country-seats, houses, temples, and whole cities:
at all events, at the Apollinarian and Eleusinian games they are baptized; and they presume
that the effect of their doing that is their regeneration and the remission of the penalties due
to their perjuries. Among the ancients, again, whoever had defiled himself with murder,
was wont to go in quest of purifying waters. Therefore, if the mere nature of water, in that
it is the appropriate material for washing away, leads men to flatter themselves with a belief
in omens of purification, how much more truly will waters render that service through the
authority of God, by whom all their nature has been constituted! If men think that water is
endued with a medicinal virtue by religion, what religion is more effectual than that of the
living God? Which fact being acknowledged, we recognise here also the zeal of the devil
rivalling the things of God,8571 while we find him, too, practising baptism in his subjects.
What similarity is there? The unclean cleanses! the ruiner sets free! the damned absolves!
He will, forsooth, destroy his own work, by washing away the sins which himself inspires!
These (remarks) have been set down by way of testimony against such as reject the faith; if
they put no trust in the things of God, the spurious imitations of which, in the case of God’s
rival, they do trust in. Are there not other cases too, in which, without any sacrament, unclean
spirits brood on waters, in spurious imitation of that brooding8572 of the Divine Spirit in
the very beginning? Witness all shady founts, and all unfrequented brooks, and the ponds
in the baths, and the conduits8573 in private houses, or the cisterns and wells which are said
to have the property of “spiriting away,”8574 through the power, that is, of a hurtful spirit.

caught,8576 or “lymphatic,” or “hydro-phobic.” Why have we adduced these instances? Lest
any think it too hard for belief that a holy angel of God should grant his presence to waters,
to temper them to man’s salvation; while the evil angel holds frequent profane commerce
with the selfsame element to man’s ruin. If it seems a novelty for an angel to be present in
waters, an example of what was to come to pass has forerun. An angel, by his intervention,
was wont to stir the pool at Bethsaida.8577 They who were complaining of ill-health used
to watch for him; for whoever had been the first to descend into them, after his washing,
ceased to complain. This figure of corporeal healing sang of a spiritual healing, according
to the rule by which things carnal are always antecedent8578 as figurative of things spiritual.
And thus, when the grace of God advanced to higher degrees among men,8579 an accession
of efficacy was granted to the waters and to the angel. They who8580 were wont to remedy
bodily defects,8581 now heal the spirit; they who used to work temporal salvation8582 now
renew eternal; they who did set free but once in the year, now save peoples in a body8583
daily, death being done away through ablution of sins. The guilt being removed, of course
the penalty is removed too. Thus man will be restored for God to His “likeness,” who in
days bygone had been conformed to “the image” of God; (the “image” is counted (to be) in
his form: the “likeness” in his eternity:) for he receives again that Spirit of God which he had
then first received from His afflatus, but had afterward lost through sin.</p>

<p>Not that in8584 the waters we obtain the Holy Spirit; but in the water, under (the witness
of) the angel, we are cleansed, and prepared for the Holy Spirit. In this case also a type has
preceded; for thus was John beforehand the Lord’s forerunner, “preparing His ways.”8585
Thus, too, does the angel, the witness8586 of baptism, “make the paths straight”8587 for the
Holy Spirit, who is about to come upon us, by the washing away of sins, which faith, sealed
in (the name of) the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, obtains. For if “in the mouth
of three witnesses every word shall stand:”8588—while, through the benediction, we have
the same (three) as witnesses of our faith whom we have as sureties8589 of our salvation
too—how much more does the number of the divine names suffice for the assurance of our
hope likewise! Moreover, after the pledging both of the attestation of faith and the promise8590
of salvation under “three witnesses,” there is added, of necessity, mention of the
Church;8591 inasmuch as, wherever there are three, (that is, the Father, the Son, and the

“the unction;” which, when made spiritual, furnished an appropriate name to the Lord, because
He was “anointed” with the Spirit by God the Father; as written in the Acts: “For truly
they were gathered together in this city8596 against Thy Holy Son whom Thou hast anointed.”
8597 Thus, too, in our case, the unction runs carnally, (i.e. on the body,) but profits
spiritually; in the same way as the act of baptism itself too is carnal, in that we are plunged
in water, but the effect spiritual, in that we are freed from sins.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Of the Imposition of Hands. Types of the Deluge and the Dove.</head>
<p>In the next place the hand is laid on us, invoking and inviting the Holy Spirit through
benediction.8598 Shall it be granted possible for human ingenuity to summon a spirit into
water, and, by the application of hands from above, to animate their union into one body8599
with another spirit of so clear sound;8600 and shall it not be possible for God, in the case of
His own organ,8601 to produce, by means of “holy hands,”8602 a sublime spiritual modulation?
But this, as well as the former, is derived from the old sacramental rite in which Jacob blessed
his grandsons, born of Joseph, Ephrem8603 and Manasses; with his hands laid on them and
interchanged, and indeed so transversely slanted one over the other, that, by delineating
Christ, they even portended the future benediction into Christ.8604 Then, over our cleansed
and blessed bodies willingly descends from the Father that Holiest Spirit. Over the waters
of baptism, recognising as it were His primeval seat,8605 He reposes: (He who) glided down
on the Lord “in the shape of a dove,”8606 in order that the nature of the Holy Spirit might
be declared by means of the creature (the emblem) of simplicity and innocence, because
even in her bodily structure the dove is without literal8607 gall. And accordingly He says,
“Be ye simple as doves.”8608 Even this is not without the supporting evidence8609 of a preceding
figure. For just as, after the waters of the deluge, by which the old iniquity was
purged—after the baptism, so to say, of the world—a dove was the herald which announced
to the earth the assuagement8610 of celestial wrath, when she had been sent her way out of
the ark, and had returned with the olive-branch, a sign which even among the nations is

<p>How many, therefore, are the pleas8617 of nature, how many the privileges of grace,
how many the solemnities of discipline, the figures, the preparations, the prayers, which
have ordained the sanctity of water? First, indeed, when the people, set unconditionally
free,8618 escaped the violence of the Egyptian king by crossing over through water, it was
water that extinguished8619 the king himself, with his entire forces.8620 What figure more
manifestly fulfilled in the sacrament of baptism? The nations are set free from the world8621
by means of water, to wit: and the devil, their old tyrant, they leave quite behind, overwhelmed
in the water. Again, water is restored from its defect of “bitterness” to its native grace of
“sweetness” by the tree8622 of Moses. That tree was Christ,8623 restoring, to wit, of Himself,
the veins of sometime envenomed and bitter nature into the all-salutary waters of baptism.
This is the water which flowed continuously down for the people from the “accompanying
rock;” for if Christ is “the Rock,” without doubt we see baptism blest by the water in Christ.
How mighty is the grace of water, in the sight of God and His Christ, for the confirmation
of baptism! Never is Christ without water: if, that is, He is Himself baptized in water;8624
inaugurates in water the first rudimentary displays of His power, when invited to the nuptials;
8625 invites the thirsty, when He makes a discourse, to His own sempiternal water;8626

<head>Chapter X.—Of John’s Baptism.</head>
<p>We have spoken, so far as our moderate ability permitted, of the generals which form
the groundwork of the sanctity8636 of baptism. I will now, equally to the best of my power,
proceed to the rest of its character, touching certain minor questions.</p>
<p>The baptism announced by John formed the subject, even at that time, of a question,
proposed by the Lord Himself indeed to the Pharisees, whether that baptism were heavenly,
or truly earthly:8637 about which they were unable to give a consistent8638 answer, inasmuch
as they understood not, because they believed not. But we, with but as poor a measure of
understanding as of faith, are able to determine that that baptism was divine indeed, (yet in
respect of the command, not in respect of efficacy8639 too, in that we read that John was
sent by the Lord to perform this duty,)8640 but human in its nature: for it conveyed nothing
celestial, but it fore-ministered to things celestial; being, to wit, appointed over repentance,
which is in man’s power.8641 In fact, the doctors of the law and the Pharisees, who were
unwilling to “believe,” did not “repent” either.8642 But if repentance is a thing human, its
baptism must necessarily be of the same nature: else, if it had been celestial, it would have
given both the Holy Spirit and remission of sins. But none either pardons sins or freely
grants the Spirit save God only.8643 Even the Lord Himself said that the Spirit would not
descend on any other condition, but that He should first ascend to the Father.8644 What the
Lord was not yet conferring, of course the servant could not furnish. Accordingly, in the
Acts of the Apostles, we find that men who had “John’s baptism” had not received the Holy
Spirit, whom they knew not even by hearing.8645 That, then, was no celestial thing which
furnished no celestial (endowments): whereas the very thing which was celestial in John—the
Spirit of prophecy—so completely failed, after the transfer of the whole Spirit to the Lord,
that he presently sent to inquire whether He whom he had himself preached,8646 whom he

had pointed out when coming to him, were “HE.”8647 And so “the baptism of repentance”8648
was dealt with8649 as if it were a candidate for the remission and sanctification shortly about
to follow in Christ: for in that John used to preach “baptism for the remission of sins,”8650
the declaration was made with reference to future remission; if it be true, (as it is,) that repentance
is antecedent, remission subsequent; and this is “preparing the way.”8651 But he
who “prepares” does not himself “perfect,” but procures for another to perfect. John himself
professes that the celestial things are not his, but Christ’s, by saying, “He who is from the
earth speaketh concerning the earth; He who comes from the realms above is above all;”8652
and again, by saying that he “baptized in repentance only, but that One would shortly come
who would baptize in the Spirit and fire;”8653—of course because true and stable faith is
baptized with water, unto salvation; pretended and weak faith is baptized with fire, unto
judgment.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—Answer to the Objection that “The Lord Did Not Baptize.”</head>
<p>“But behold, “say some, “the Lord came, and baptized not; for we read, ‘And yet He
used not to baptize, but His disciples!’”8654 As if, in truth, John had preached that He would
baptize with His own hands! Of course, his words are not so to be understood, but as simply
spoken after an ordinary manner; just as, for instance, we say, “The emperor set forth an
edict,” or, “The prefect cudgelled him.” Pray does the emperor in person set forth, or the
prefect in person cudgel? One whose ministers do a thing is always said to do it.8655 So “He
will baptize you” will have to be understood as standing for, “Through Him,” or “Into Him,”
“you will be baptized.” But let not (the fact) that “He Himself baptized not” trouble any.
For into whom should He baptize? Into repentance? Of what use, then, do you make His
forerunner? Into remission of sins, which He used to give by a word? Into Himself, whom
by humility He was concealing? Into the Holy Spirit, who had not yet descended from the
Father? Into the Church, which His apostles had not yet founded? And thus it was with the
selfsame “baptism of John” that His disciples used to baptize, as ministers, with which John
before had baptized as forerunner. Let none think it was with some other, because no other
exists, except that of Christ subsequently; which at that time, of course, could not be given
by His disciples, inasmuch as the glory of the Lord had not yet been fully attained,8656 nor
the efficacy of the font8657 established through the passion and the resurrection; because
neither can our death see dissolution except by the Lord’s passion, nor our life be restored
without His resurrection.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Of the Necessity of Baptism to Salvation.</head>
<p>When, however, the prescript is laid down that “without baptism, salvation is attainable
by none” (chiefly on the ground of that declaration of the Lord, who says, “Unless one be
born of water, he hath not life”8658), there arise immediately scrupulous, nay rather audacious,
doubts on the part of some, “how, in accordance with that prescript, salvation is attainable
by the apostles, whom—Paul excepted—we do not find baptized in the Lord? Nay,
since Paul is the only one of them who has put on the garment of Christ’s baptism,8659 either
the peril of all the others who lack the water of Christ is prejudged, that the prescript may
be maintained, or else the prescript is rescinded if salvation has been ordained even for the
unbaptized.” I have heard—the Lord is my witness—doubts of that kind: that none may
imagine me so abandoned as to excogitate, unprovoked, in the licence of my pen, ideas
which would inspire others with scruple.</p>
<p>And now, as far as I shall be able, I will reply to them who affirm “that the apostles were
unbaptized.” For if they had undergone the human baptism of John, and were longing for
that of the Lord, then since the Lord Himself had defined baptism to be one;8660 (saying to
Peter, who was desirous8661 of being thoroughly bathed, “He who hath once bathed hath
no necessity to wash a second time;”8662 which, of course, He would not have said at all to
one not baptized;) even here we have a conspicuous8663 proof against those who, in order
to destroy the sacrament of water, deprive the apostles even of John’s baptism. Can it seem
credible that “the way of the Lord,” that is, the baptism of John, had not then been “prepared”
in those persons who were being destined to open the way of the Lord throughout the whole
world? The Lord Himself, though no “repentance” was due from Him, was baptized: was
baptism not necessary for sinners? As for the fact, then, that “others were not baptized”—
they, however, were not companions of Christ, but enemies of the faith, doctors of
the law and Pharisees. From which fact is gathered an additional suggestion, that, since the
opposers of the Lord refused to be baptized, they who followed the Lord were baptized, and
were not like-minded with their own rivals: especially when, if there were any one to whom
they clave, the Lord had exalted John above him (by the testimony) saying, “Among them
who are born of women there is none greater than John the Baptist.”8664</p>

<p>Others make the suggestion (forced enough, clearly “that the apostles then served the
turn of baptism when in their little ship, were sprinkled and covered with the waves: that
Peter himself also was immersed enough when he walked on the sea.”8665 It is, however, as
I think, one thing to be sprinkled or intercepted by the violence of the sea; another thing to
be baptized in obedience to the discipline of religion. But that little ship did present a figure
of the Church, in that she is disquieted “in the sea,” that is, in the world,8666 “by the waves,”
that is, by persecutions and temptations; the Lord, through patience, sleeping as it were,
until, roused in their last extremities by the prayers of the saints, He checks the world,8667
and restores tranquillity to His own.</p>
<p>Now, whether they were baptized in any manner whatever, or whether they continued
unbathed8668 to the end—so that even that saying of the Lord touching the “one bath”8669
does, under the person of Peter, merely regard us—still, to determine concerning the salvation
of the apostles is audacious enough, because on them the prerogative even of first choice,8670
and thereafter of undivided intimacy, might be able to confer the compendious grace of
baptism, seeing they (I think) followed Him who was wont to promise salvation to every
believer. “Thy faith,” He would say, “hath saved thee;”8671 and, “Thy sins shall be remitted
thee,”8672 on thy believing, of course, albeit thou be not yet baptized. If that8673 was wanting
to the apostles, I know not in the faith of what things it was, that, roused by one word of the
Lord, one left the toll-booth behind for ever;8674 another deserted father and ship, and the
craft by which he gained his living;8675 a third, who disdained his father’s obsequies,8676
fulfilled, before he heard it, that highest precept of the Lord, “He who prefers father or
mother to me, is not worthy of me.”8677</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—Another Objection: Abraham Pleased God Without Being Baptized.
Answer Thereto. Old Things Must Give Place to New, and Baptism is Now a
Law.</head>
<p>Here, then, those miscreants8678 provoke questions. And so they say, “Baptism is not
necessary for them to whom faith is sufficient; for withal, Abraham pleased God by a sacrament
of no water, but of faith.” But in all cases it is the later things which have a conclusive
force, and the subsequent which prevail over the antecedent. Grant that, in days gone by,
there was salvation by means of bare faith, before the passion and resurrection of the Lord.
But now that faith has been enlarged, and is become a faith which believes in His nativity,
passion, and resurrection, there has been an amplification added to the sacrament,8679 viz.,
the sealing act of baptism; the clothing, in some sense, of the faith which before was bare,
and which cannot exist now without its proper law. For the law of baptizing has been imposed,
and the formula prescribed: “Go,” He saith, “teach the nations, baptizing them into the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.”8680 The comparison with this law of
that definition, “Unless a man have been reborn of water and Spirit, he shall not enter into
the kingdom of the heavens,”8681 has tied faith to the necessity of baptism. Accordingly,
all thereafter8682 who became believers used to be baptized. Then it was, too,8683 that Paul,
when he believed, was baptized; and this is the meaning of the precept which the Lord had
given him when smitten with the plague of loss of sight, saying, “Arise, and enter Damascus;
there shall be demonstrated to thee what thou oughtest to do,” to wit—be baptized, which
was the only thing lacking to him. That point excepted, he had sufficiently learnt and believed
“the Nazarene” to be “the Lord, the Son of God.”8684</p>

<p>But they roll back an objection from that apostle himself, in that he said, “For Christ sent
me not to baptize;”8685 as if by this argument baptism were done away! For if so, why did
he baptize Gaius, and Crispus, and the house of Stephanas?8686 However, even if Christ had
not sent him to baptize, yet He had given other apostles the precept to baptize. But these
words were written to the Corinthians in regard of the circumstances of that particular time;
seeing that schisms and dissensions were agitated among them, while one attributes everything
to Paul, another to Apollos.8687 For which reason the “peace-making”8688 apostle, for fear
he should seem to claim all gifts for himself, says that he had been sent “not to baptize, but
to preach.” For preaching is the prior thing, baptizing the posterior. Therefore the preaching
came first: but I think baptizing withal was lawful to him to whom preaching was.</p>

<head>Chapter XV.—Unity of Baptism. Remarks on Heretical And Jewish Baptism.</head>
<p>I know not whether any further point is mooted to bring baptism into controversy.
Permit me to call to mind what I have omitted above, lest I seem to break off the train of
impending thoughts in the middle. There is to us one, and but one, baptism; as well according
to the Lord’s gospel8689 as according to the apostle’s letters,8690 inasmuch as he says, “One
God, and one baptism, and one church in the heavens.”8691 But it must be admitted that
the question, “What rules are to be observed with regard to heretics?” is worthy of being
treated. For it is to us8692 that that assertion8693 refers. Heretics, however, have no fellowship
in our discipline, whom the mere fact of their excommunication8694 testifies to be outsiders.
I am not bound to recognize in them a thing which is enjoined on me, because they and we
have not the same God, nor one—that is, the same—Christ. And therefore their baptism is
not one with ours either, because it is not the same; a baptism which, since they have it not
duly, doubtless they have not at all; nor is that capable of being counted which is not had.8695
Thus they cannot receive it either, because they have it not. But this point has already received
a fuller discussion from us in Greek. We enter, then, the font8696 once: once are sins washed
away, because they ought never to be repeated. But the Jewish Israel bathes daily,8697 because
he is daily being defiled: and, for fear that defilement should be practised among us also,
therefore was the definition touching the one bathing8698 made. Happy water, which once
washes away; which does not mock sinners (with vain hopes); which does not, by being infected
with the repetition of impurities, again defile them whom it has washed!</p>

John has written; that He might be baptized by the water, glorified by the blood; to make
us, in like manner, called by water, chosen8702 by blood. These two baptisms He sent out
from the wound in His pierced side,8703 in order that they who believed in His blood might
be bathed with the water; they who had been bathed in the water might likewise drink the
blood.8704 This is the baptism which both stands in lieu of the fontal bathing8705 when that
has not been received, and restores it when lost.</p>

<head>Chapter XVII.—Of the Power of Conferring Baptism.</head>
<p>For concluding our brief subject,8706 it remains to put you in mind also of the due observance
of giving and receiving baptism. Of giving it, the chief priest8707 (who is the bishop)
has the right: in the next place, the presbyters and deacons, yet not without the bishop’s
authority, on account of the honour of the Church, which being preserved, peace is preserved.
Beside these, even laymen have the right; for what is equally received can be equally given.
Unless bishops, or priests, or deacons, be on the spot, other disciples are called i.e. to the
work. The word of the Lord ought not to be hidden by any: in like manner, too, baptism,
which is equally God’s property,8708 can be administered by all. But how much more is the
rule8709 of reverence and modesty incumbent on laymen—seeing that these powers8710 belong
to their superiors—lest they assume to themselves the specific8711 function of the bishop!
Emulation of the episcopal office is the mother of schisms. The most holy apostle has said,
that “all things are lawful, but not all expedient.”8712 Let it suffice assuredly, in cases of necessity,
to avail yourself (of that rule8713, if at any time circumstance either of place, or of
time, or of person compels you (so to do); for then the stedfast courage of the succourer,
when the situation of the endangered one is urgent, is exceptionally admissible; inasmuch
as he will be guilty of a human creature’s loss if he shall refrain from bestowing what he had
free liberty to bestow. But the woman of pertness,8714 who has usurped the power to teach,
will of course not give birth for herself likewise to a right of baptizing, unless some new
beast shall arise8715 like the former; so that, just as the one abolished baptism,8716 so some
other should in her own right confer it! But if the writings which wrongly go under Paul’s
name, claim Thecla’s example as a licence for women’s teaching and baptizing, let them

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Of the Persons to Whom, and the Time When, Baptism is to Be
Administered.</head>
<p>But they whose office it is, know that baptism is not rashly to be administered. “Give
to every one who beggeth thee,”8722 has a reference of its own, appertaining especially to
almsgiving. On the contrary, this precept is rather to be looked at carefully: “Give not the
holy thing to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine;”8723 and, “Lay not hands easily
on any; share not other men’s sins.”8724 If Philip so “easily” baptized the chamberlain, let
us reflect that a manifest and conspicuous8725 evidence that the Lord deemed him worthy
had been interposed.8726 The Spirit had enjoined Philip to proceed to that road: the eunuch
himself, too, was not found idle, nor as one who was suddenly seized with an eager desire
to be baptized; but, after going up to the temple for prayer’s sake, being intently engaged
on the divine Scripture, was thus suitably discovered—to whom God had, unasked, sent an
apostle, which one, again, the Spirit bade adjoin himself to the chamberlain’s chariot. The
Scripture which he was reading8727falls in opportunely with his faith: Philip, being requested,
is taken to sit beside him; the Lord is pointed out; faith lingers not; water needs no waiting
for; the work is completed, and the apostle snatched away. “But Paul too was, in fact,
‘speedily’ baptized:” for Simon,8728 his host, speedily recognized him to be “an appointed
vessel of election.” God’s approbation sends sure premonitory tokens before it; every “petition”
8729 may both deceive and be deceived. And so, according to the circumstances and
disposition, and even age, of each individual, the delay of baptism is preferable; principally,
however, in the case of little children. For why is it necessary—if (baptism itself) is not so
necessary8730—that the sponsors likewise should be thrust into danger? Who both themselves,
by reason of mortality, may fail to fulfil their promises, and may be disappointed by the

development of an evil disposition, in those for whom they stood? The Lord does indeed say,
“Forbid them not to come unto me.”8731 Let them “come,” then, while they are growing up;
let them “come” while they are learning, while they are learning whither to come;8732 let
them become Christians8733 when they have become able to know Christ. Why does the
innocent period of life hasten to the “remission of sins?” More caution will be exercised in
worldly8734 matters: so that one who is not trusted with earthly substance is trusted with
divine! Let them know how to “ask” for salvation, that you may seem (at least) to have given
“to him that asketh.”8735 For no less cause must the unwedded also be deferred—in whom
the ground of temptation is prepared, alike in such as never were wedded8736 by means of
their maturity, and in the widowed by means of their freedom—until they either marry, or
else be more fully strengthened for continence. If any understand the weighty import of
baptism, they will fear its reception more than its delay: sound faith is secure of salvation.</p>

<head>Chapter XIX.—Of the Times Most Suitable for Baptism.</head>
<p>The Passover affords a more than usually solemn day for baptism; when, withal, the
Lord’s passion, in which we are baptized, was completed. Nor will it be incongruous to interpret
figuratively the fact that, when the Lord was about to celebrate the last Passover, He
said to the disciples who were sent to make preparation, “Ye will meet a man bearing water.”
8737 He points out the place for celebrating the Passover by the sign of water. After that,
Pentecost is a most joyous space8738 for conferring baptisms;8739 wherein, too, the resurrection
of the Lord was repeatedly proved8740 among the disciples, and the hope of the advent
of the Lord indirectly pointed to, in that, at that time, when He had been received back into
the heavens, the angels8741 told the apostles that “He would so come, as He had withal ascended
into the heavens;”8742 at Pentecost, of course. But, moreover, when Jeremiah says,
“And I will gather them together from the extremities of the land in the feast-day,” he signifies
the day of the Passover and of Pentecost, which is properly a “feast-day.”8743 However, every
day is the Lord’s; every hour, every time, is apt for baptism: if there is a difference in the
solemnity, distinction there is none in the grace.</p>

<head>Chapter XX.—Of Preparation For, and Conduct After, the Reception of Baptism.</head>
<p>They who are about to enter baptism ought to pray with repeated prayers, fasts, and
bendings of the knee, and vigils all the night through, and with the confession of all bygone
sins, that they may express the meaning even of the baptism of John: “They were baptized,”
saith (the Scripture), “confessing their own sins.”8744 To us it is matter for thankfulness if
we do now publicly confess our iniquities or our turpitudes:8745 for we do at the same time
both make satisfaction8746 for our former sins, by mortification of our flesh and spirit, and
lay beforehand the foundation of defences against the temptations which will closely follow.
“Watch and pray,” saith (the Lord), “lest ye fall into temptation.”8747 And the reason, I believe,
why they were tempted was, that they fell asleep; so that they deserted the Lord when
apprehended, and he who continued to stand by Him, and used the sword, even denied
Him thrice: for withal the word had gone before, that “no one untempted should attain the
celestial kingdoms.”8748 The Lord Himself forthwith after baptism8749 temptations surrounded,
when in forty days He had kept fast. “Then,” some one will say, “it becomes us, too,
rather to fast after baptism.”8750 Well, and who forbids you, unless it be the necessity for
joy, and the thanksgiving for salvation? But so far as I, with my poor powers, understand,
the Lord figuratively retorted upon Israel the reproach they had cast on the Lord.8751 For
the people, after crossing the sea, and being carried about in the desert during forty years,
although they were there nourished with divine supplies, nevertheless were more mindful
of their belly and their gullet than of God. Thereupon the Lord, driven apart into desert
places after baptism,8752 showed, by maintaining a fast of forty days, that the man of God
lives “not by bread alone,” but “by the word of God;”8753 and that temptations incident to

On Prayer.</head>

 <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>Chapter I.—General Introduction.8760</head>
<p>The Spirit of God, and the Word of God, and the Reason of God—Word of Reason,
and Reason and Spirit of Word—Jesus Christ our Lord, namely, who is both the one and
the other,8761—has determined for us, the disciples of the New Testament, a new form of
prayer; for in this particular also it was needful that new wine should be laid up in new skins,
and a new breadth be sewn to a new garment.8762 Besides, whatever had been in bygone
days, has either been quite changed, as circumcision; or else supplemented, as the rest of
the Law; or else fulfilled, as Prophecy; or else perfected, as faith itself. For the new grace of
God has renewed all things from carnal unto spiritual, by superinducing the Gospel, the
obliterator of the whole ancient bygone system; in which our Lord Jesus Christ has been
approved as the Spirit of God, and the Word of God, and the Reason of God: the Spirit, by
which He was mighty; the Word, by which He taught; the Reason, by which He came.8763
So the prayer composed by Christ has been composed of three parts. In speech,8764 by which
prayer is enunciated, in spirit, by which alone it prevails, even John had taught his disciples
to pray,8765 but all John’s doings were laid as groundwork for Christ, until, when “He had

increased”—just as the same John used to fore-announce “that it was needful” that “He
should increase and himself decrease”8766—the whole work of the forerunner passed over,
together with his spirit itself, unto the Lord. Therefore, after what form of words John taught
to pray is not extant, because earthly things have given place to heavenly. “He who is from
the earth,” says John, “speaketh earthly things; and He who is here from the heavens
speaketh those things which He hath seen.”8767 And what is the Lord Christ’s—as this
method of praying is—that is not heavenly? And so, blessed brethren, let us consider His
heavenly wisdom: first, touching the precept of praying secretly, whereby He exacted man’s
faith, that he should be confident that the sight and hearing of Almighty God are present
beneath roofs, and extend even into the secret place; and required modesty in faith, that it
should offer its religious homage to Him alone, whom it believed to see and to hear everywhere.
Further, since wisdom succeeded in the following precept, let it in like manner appertain
unto faith, and the modesty of faith, that we think not that the Lord must be approached
with a train of words, who, we are certain, takes unsolicited foresight for His own.
And yet that very brevity—and let this make for the third grade of wisdom—is supported
on the substance of a great and blessed interpretation, and is as diffuse in meaning as it is
compressed in words. For it has embraced not only the special duties of prayer, be it veneration
of God or petition for man, but almost every discourse of the Lord, every record of
His Discipline; so that, in fact, in the Prayer is comprised an epitome of the whole Gospel.</p>

<head>Chapter II.—The First Clause.</head>
<p>The prayer begins with a testimony to God, and with the reward of faith, when we say,
“Our Father who art in the heavens;” for (in so saying), we at once pray to God, and commend
faith, whose reward this appellation is. It is written, “To them who believed on Him He
gave power to be called sons of God.”8768 However, our Lord very frequently proclaimed
God as a Father to us; nay, even gave a precept “that we call no one on earth father, but the
Father whom we have in the heavens:”8769 and so, in thus praying, we are likewise obeying
the precept. Happy they who recognize their Father! This is the reproach that is brought
against Israel, to which the Spirit attests heaven and earth, saying, “I have begotten sons,
and they have not recognized me.”8770 Moreover, in saying “Father,” we also call Him “God.”
That appellation is one both of filial duty and of power. Again, in the Father the Son is invoked;
“for I,” saith He, “and the Father are One.”8771 Nor is even our mother the Church
passed by, if, that is, in the Father and the Son is recognized the mother, from whom arises
the name both of Father and of Son. In one general term, then, or word, we both honour
God, together with His own,8772 and are mindful of the precept, and set a mark on such as
have forgotten their Father.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—The Second Clause.</head>
<p>The name of “God the Father” had been published to none. Even Moses, who had interrogated
Him on that very point, had heard a different name.8773 To us it has been revealed
in the Son, for the Son is now the Father’s new name. “I am come,” saith He, “in the Father’s
name;”8774 and again, “Father, glorify Thy name;”8775 and more openly, “I have manifested
Thy name to men.”8776 That name, therefore, we pray may “be hallowed.” Not that it is
becoming for men to wish God well, as if there were any other8777 by whom He may be
wished well, or as if He would suffer unless we do so wish. Plainly, it is universally becoming
for God to be blessed8778 in every place and time, on account of the memory of His benefits
ever due from every man. But this petition also serves the turn of a blessing. Otherwise,
when is the name of God not “holy,” and “hallowed” through Himself, seeing that of Himself
He sanctifies all others—He to whom that surrounding circle of angels cease not to say,
“Holy, holy, holy?”8779 In like wise, therefore, we too, candidates for angelhood, if we succeed
in deserving it, begin even here on earth to learn by heart that strain hereafter to be raised
unto God, and the function of future glory. So far, for the glory of God. On the other hand,
for our own petition, when we say, “Hallowed be Thy name,” we pray this; that it may be
hallowed in us who are in Him, as well in all others for whom the grace of God is still waiting;
8780 that we may obey this precept, too, in “praying for all,”8781 even for our personal
enemies.8782 And therefore with suspended utterance, not saying, “Hallowed be it in us,”
we say,—“in all.”</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—The Third Clause.</head>
<p>According to this model,8783 we subjoin, “Thy will be done in the heavens and on the
earth;”8784 not that there is some power withstanding8785 to prevent God’s will being done,
and we pray for Him the successful achievement of His will; but we pray for His will to be
done in all. For, by figurative interpretation of flesh and spirit, we are “heaven” and “earth;”
albeit, even if it is to be understood simply, still the sense of the petition is the same, that in
us God’s will be done on earth, to make it possible, namely, for it to be done also in the
heavens. What, moreover, does God will, but that we should walk according to His Discipline?
We make petition, then, that He supply us with the substance of His will, and the capacity
to do it, that we may be saved both in the heavens and on earth; because the sum of His will
is the salvation of them whom He has adopted. There is, too, that will of God which the
Lord accomplished in preaching, in working, in enduring: for if He Himself proclaimed
that He did not His own, but the Father’s will, without doubt those things which He used
to do were the Father’s will;8786 unto which things, as unto exemplars, we are now pro-
voked;8787 to preach, to work, to endure even unto death. And we need the will of God, that
we may be able to fulfil these duties. Again, in saying, “Thy will be done,” we are even
wishing well to ourselves, in so far that there is nothing of evil in the will of God; even if,
proportionably to each one’s deserts, somewhat other8788 is imposed on us. So by this expression
we premonish our own selves unto patience. The Lord also, when He had wished
to demonstrate to us, even in His own flesh, the flesh’s infirmity, by the reality of suffering,
said, “Father, remove this Thy cup;” and remembering Himself, added, “save that not my
will, but Thine be done.”8789 Himself was the Will and the Power of the Father: and yet,
for the demonstration of the patience which was due, He gave Himself up to the Father’s
Will.</p>

<p>“Thy kingdom come” has also reference to that whereto “Thy will be done” refers—in
us, that is. For when does God not reign, in whose hand is the heart of all kings?8790 But
whatever we wish for ourselves we augur for Him, and to Him we attribute what from Him
we expect. And so, if the manifestation of the Lord’s kingdom pertains unto the will of God
and unto our anxious expectation, how do some pray for some protraction of the age,8791
when the kingdom of God, which we pray may arrive, tends unto the consummation of the
age?8792 Our wish is, that our reign be hastened, not our servitude protracted. Even if it had
not been prescribed in the Prayer that we should ask for the advent of the kingdom, we
should, unbidden, have sent forth that cry, hastening toward the realization of our hope.
The souls of the martyrs beneath the altar8793 cry in jealousy unto the Lord, “How long,
Lord, dost Thou not avenge our blood on the inhabitants of the earth?”8794 for, of course,
their avenging is regulated by8795 the end of the age. Nay, Lord, Thy kingdom come with
all speed,—the prayer of Christians the confusion of the heathen,8796 the exultation of angels,

<p>But how gracefully has the Divine Wisdom arranged the order of the prayer; so that
after things heavenly—that is, after the “Name” of God, the “Will” of God, and the “Kingdom”
of God—it should give earthly necessities also room for a petition! For the Lord had8797
withal issued His edict, “Seek ye first the kingdom, and then even these shall be added:”8798
albeit we may rather understand, “Give us this day our daily bread,” spiritually. For Christ
is our Bread; because Christ is Life, and bread is life. “I am,” saith He, “the Bread of Life;”8799
and, a little above, “The Bread is the Word of the living God, who came down from the
heavens.”8800 Then we find, too, that His body is reckoned in bread: “This is my body.”8801
And so, in petitioning for “daily bread,” we ask for perpetuity in Christ, and indivisibility
from His body. But, because that word is admissible in a carnal sense too, it cannot be so
used without the religious remembrance withal of spiritual Discipline; for (the Lord) commands
that bread be prayed for, which is the only food necessary for believers; for “all other
things the nations seek after.”8802 The like lesson He both inculcates by examples, and repeatedly
handles in parables, when He says, “Doth a father take away bread from his children,
and hand it to dogs?”8803 and again, “Doth a father give his son a stone when he asks for
bread?”8804 For He thus shows what it is that sons expect from their father. Nay, even that
nocturnal knocker knocked for “bread.”8805 Moreover, He justly added, “Give us this day,”
seeing He had previously said, “Take no careful thought about the morrow, what ye are to
eat.”8806 To which subject He also adapted the parable of the man who pondered on an
enlargement of his barns for his forthcoming fruits, and on seasons of prolonged security;
but that very night he dies.8807</p>
<note type="footnote">8797 This is a slight mistake of Tertullian. The words referred to, “Seek ye first,” etc., do not occur till the end

<p>It was suitable that, after contemplating the liberality of God,8808 we should likewise
address His clemency. For what will aliments8809 profit us, if we are really consigned to
them, as it were a bull destined for a victim?8810 The Lord knew Himself to be the only
guiltless One, and so He teaches that we beg “to have our debts remitted us.” A petition for
pardon is a full confession; because he who begs for pardon fully admits his guilt. Thus, too,
penitence is demonstrated acceptable to God who desires it rather than the death of the
sinner.8811 Moreover, debt is, in the Scriptures, a figure of guilt; because it is equally due to
the sentence of judgment, and is exacted by it: nor does it evade the justice of exaction, unless
the exaction be remitted, just as the lord remitted to that slave in the parable his debt;8812
for hither does the scope of the whole parable tend. For the fact withal, that the same servant,
after liberated by his lord, does not equally spare his own debtor; and, being on that account
impeached before his lord, is made over to the tormentor to pay the uttermost farthing—that
is, every guilt, however small: corresponds with our profession that “we also remit to our
debtors;” indeed elsewhere, too, in conformity with this Form of Prayer, He saith, “Remit,
and it shall be remitted you.”8813 And when Peter had put the question whether remission
were to be granted to a brother seven times, “Nay,” saith He, “seventy-seven times;”8814 in
order to remould the Law for the better; because in Genesis vengeance was assigned “seven
times” in the case of Cain, but in that of Lamech “seventy-seven times.”8815</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—The Seventh or Final Clause.</head>
<p>For the completeness of so brief a prayer He added—in order that we should supplicate
not touching the remitting merely, but touching the entire averting, of acts of guilt—“Lead
us not into temptation:” that is, suffer us not to be led into it, by him (of course) who tempts;
but far be the thought that the Lord should seem to tempt,8816 as if He either were ignorant
of the faith of any, or else were eager to overthrow it. Infirmity8817 and malice8818 are
characteristics of the devil. For God had commanded even Abraham to make a sacrifice of
his son, for the sake not of tempting, but proving, his faith; in order through him to make
an example for that precept of His, whereby He was, by and by, to enjoin that he should
hold no pledges of affection dearer than God.8819 He Himself, when tempted by the devil,
demonstrated who it is that presides over and is the originator of temptation.8820 This passage
He confirms by subsequent ones, saying, “Pray that ye be not tempted;”8821 yet they were
tempted, (as they showed) by deserting their Lord, because they had given way rather to
sleep than prayer.8822 The final clause, therefore, is consonant, and interprets the sense of
“Lead us not into temptation;” for this sense is, “But convey us away from the Evil One.”</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—Recapitulation.8823</head>
<p>In summaries of so few words, how many utterances of the prophets, the Gospels, the
apostles—how many discourses, examples, parables of the Lord, are touched on! How many
duties are simultaneously discharged! The honour of God in the “Father;” the testimony of
faith in the “Name;” the offering of obedience in the “Will;” the commemoration of hope
in the “Kingdom;” the petition for life in the “Bread;” the full acknowledgment of debts in
the prayer for their “Forgiveness;” the anxious dread of temptation in the request for “Protection.”
What wonder? God alone could teach how he wished Himself prayed to. The religious
rite of prayer therefore, ordained by Himself, and animated, even at the moment when
it was issuing out of the Divine mouth, by His own Spirit, ascends, by its own prerogative,
into heaven, commending to the Father what the Son has taught.</p>

<p>That we may not be as far from the ears of God as we are from His precepts,8826 the
memory of His precepts paves for our prayers a way unto heaven; of which precepts the chief
is, that we go not up unto God’s altar8827 before we compose whatever of discord or offence
we have contracted with our brethren.8828 For what sort of deed is it to approach the peace
of God8829 without peace? the remission of debts8830 while you retain them? How will he
appease his Father who is angry with his brother, when from the beginning “all anger” is
forbidden us?8831 For even Joseph, when dismissing his brethren for the purpose of fetching
their father, said, “And be not angry in the way.”8832 He warned us, to be sure, at that time
(for elsewhere our Discipline is called “the Way”8833), that when, set in “the way” of prayer,
we go not unto “the Father” with anger. After that, the Lord, “amplifying the Law,”8834
openly adds the prohibition of anger against a brother to that of murder.8835 Not even by
an evil word does He permit it to be vented.8836 Ever if we must be angry, our anger must
not be maintained beyond sunset, as the apostle admonishes.8837 But how rash is it either
to pass a day without prayer, while you refuse to make satisfaction to your brother; or else,
by perseverance in anger, to lose your prayer?</p>

from idolatry, and all the other blemishes which, conceived by the spirit, are effected by the
operation of the hands. These are the true purities;8843 not those which most are superstitiously
careful about, taking water at every prayer, even when they are coming from a bath
of the whole body. When I was scrupulously making a thorough investigation of this practice,
and searching into the reason of it, I ascertained it to be a commemorative act, bearing on
the surrender8844 of our Lord. We, however, pray to the Lord: we do not surrender Him;
nay, we ought even to set ourselves in opposition to the example of His surrenderer, and
not, on that account, wash our hands. Unless any defilement contracted in human intercourse
be a conscientious cause for washing them, they are otherwise clean enough, which
together with our whole body we once washed in Christ.8845</p>

<p>Albeit Israel washed daily all his limbs over, yet is he never clean. His hands, at all

crimes,8846 they do not dare even to raise them unto the Lord,8847 for fear some Isaiah

to superstition, being studied, and forced, and of curious rather than rational ceremony;8852
deserving of restraint, at all events, even on this ground, that they put us on a level with
Gentiles.8853 As, e.g., it is the custom of some to make prayer with cloaks doffed, for so do
the nations approach their idols; which practice, of course, were its observance becoming,

<head>Chapter XVI.—Of Sitting After Prayer.</head>
<p>Again, for the custom which some have of sitting when prayer is ended, I perceive no
reason, except that which children give.8857 For what if that Hermas,8858 whose writing is
generally inscribed with the title The Shepherd, had, after finishing his prayer, not sat down
on his bed, but done some other thing: should we maintain that also as a matter for observance?
Of course not. Why, even as it is the sentence, “When I had prayed, and had sat down
on my bed,” is simply put with a view to the order of the narration, not as a model of discipline.
Else we shall have to pray nowhere except where there is a bed! Nay, whoever sits in
a chair or on a bench, will act contrary to that writing. Further: inasmuch as the nations do
the like, in sitting down after adoring their petty images; even on this account the practice
deserves to be censured in us, because it is observed in the worship of idols. To this is further
added the charge of irreverence,—intelligible even to the nations themselves, if they had any
sense. If, on the one hand, it is irreverent to sit under the eye, and over against the eye, of
him whom you most of all revere and venerate; how much more, on the other hand, is that
deed most irreligious under the eye of the living God, while the angel of prayer is still
standing by8859 unless we are upbraiding God that prayer has wearied us!</p>

and dejection not merely in his supplication, but in his countenance too, went his way “more
justified” than the shameless Pharisee.8860 The sounds of our voice, likewise, should be
subdued; else, if we are to be heard for our noise, how large windpipes should we need! But
God is the hearer not of the voice, but of the heart, just as He is its inspector. The demon of
the Pythian oracle says:</p>
<p>“And I do understand the mute, and plainly hear the speechless one.”8861</p>
<p>Do the ears of God wait for sound? How, then, could Jonah’s prayer find way out unto
heaven from the depth of the whale’s belly, through the entrails of so huge a beast; from the
very abysses, through so huge a mass of sea? What superior advantage will they who pray

<head>Chapter XVIII.—Of the Kiss of Peace.</head>
<p>Another custom has now become prevalent. Such as are fasting withhold the kiss of
peace, which is the seal of prayer, after prayer made with brethren. But when is peace more
to be concluded with brethren than when, at the time of some religious observance,8863 our
prayer ascends with more acceptability; that they may themselves participate in our observance,
and thereby be mollified for transacting with their brother touching their own peace?
What prayer is complete if divorced from the “holy kiss?”8864 Whom does peace impede
when rendering service to his Lord? What kind of sacrifice is that from which men depart
without peace? Whatever our prayer be, it will not be better than the observance of the
precept by which we are bidden to conceal our fasts;8865 for now, by abstinence from the
kiss, we are known to be fasting. But even if there be some reason for this practice, still, lest
you offend against this precept, you may perhaps defer your “peace” at home, where it is
not possible for your fast to be entirely kept secret. But wherever else you can conceal your
observance, you ought to remember the precept: thus you may satisfy the requirements of
Discipline abroad and of custom at home. So, too, on the day of the passover,8866 when the
religious observance of a fast is general, and as it were public, we justly forego the kiss, caring
nothing to conceal anything which we do in common with all.</p>

<p>Similarly, too, touching the days of Stations,8867 most think that they must not be present
at the sacrificial prayers, on the ground that the Station must be dissolved by reception of
the Lord’s Body. Does, then, the Eucharist cancel a service devoted to God, or bind it more
to God? Will not your Station be more solemn if you have withal stood at God’s altar?8868
When the Lord’s Body has been received and reserved8869 each point is secured, both the
participation of the sacrifice and the discharge of duty. If the “Station” has received its name
from the example of military life—for we withal are God’s military8870—of course no gladness
or sadness chanting to the camp abolishes the “stations” of the soldiers: for gladness will
carry out discipline more willingly, sadness more carefully.</p>

<p>But that point which is promiscuously observed throughout the churches, whether virgins

head-covering, appear to rest on this; that the apostle has not defined “virgins” by name,
but “women,”8873 as “to be veiled;” nor the sex generally, so as to say “females,” but a class
of the sex, by saying “women:” for if he had named the sex by saying “females,” he would
have made his limit absolute for every woman; but while he names one class of the sex, he
separates another class by being silent. For, they say, he might either have named “virgins”
specially; or generally, by a compendious term, “females.”</p>

<head>Chapter XXII.—Answer to the Foregoing Arguments.</head>
<p>They who make this concession8874 ought to reflect on the nature of the word itself—
what is the meaning of “woman” from the very first records of the sacred writings.
Here they find it to be the name of the sex, not a class of the sex: if, that is, God gave to Eve,
when she had not yet known a man, the surname “woman” and “female”8875—(“female,”
whereby the sex generally; “woman,” hereby a class of the sex, is marked).8876 So, since at
that time the as yet unwedded Eve was called by the word “woman,” that word has been
made common even to a virgin.8877 Nor is it wonderful that the apostle—guided, of course,
by the same Spirit by whom, as all the divine Scripture, so that book Genesis, was drawn
up—has used the selfsame word in writing “women,” which, by the example of Eve unwedded,
is applicable too to a “virgin.” In fact, all the other passages are in consonance herewith. For
even by this very fact, that he has not named “virgins” (as he does in another place8878 where
he is teaching touching marrying), he sufficiently predicates that his remark is made
touching every woman, and touching the whole sex; and that there is no distinction made
between a “virgin” and any other, while he does not name her at all. For he who elsewhere—
namely, where the difference requires—remembers to make the distinction,
(moreover, he makes it by designating each species by their appropriate names,) wishes,
where he makes no distinction (while he does not name each), no difference to be understood.
What of the fact that in the Greek speech, in which the apostle wrote his letters, it is usual
to say, “women” rather than “females;” that is, γυναῖκας (gunaikas) rather than θηλείας
(theleias)? Therefore if that word,8879 which by interpretation represents what “female”
(femina) represents,8880 is frequently used instead of the name of the sex,8881 he has named
the sex in saying γυναῖκα; but in the sex even the virgin is embraced. But, withal, the declar-

ation is plain: “Every woman,” saith he, “praying and prophesying with head uncovered,8882
dishonoureth her own head.”8883 What is “every woman,” but woman of every age, of every
rank, of every condition? By saying “every” he excepts nought of womanhood, just as he
excepts nought of manhood either from not being covered; for just so he says, “Every
man.”8884 As, then, in the masculine sex, under the name of “man” even the “youth” is forbidden
to be veiled; so, too, in the feminine, under the name of “woman,” even the “virgin”
is bidden to be veiled. Equally in each sex let the younger age follow the discipline of the
elder; or else let the male “virgins,”8885 too, be veiled, if the female virgins withal are not
veiled, because they are not mentioned by name. Let “man” and “youth” be different, if
“woman” and “virgin” are different. For indeed it is “on account of the angels”8886 that he
saith women must be veiled, because on account of “the daughters of men” angels revolted
from God.8887 Who then, would contend that “women” alone—that is,8888 such as were
already wedded and had lost their virginity—were the objects of angelic concupiscence,
unless “virgins” are incapable of excelling in beauty and finding lovers? Nay, let us see
whether it were not virgins alone whom they lusted after; since Scriptures saith “the daughters
of men;”8889 inasmuch as it might have named “wives of men,” or “females,” indifferently.8890
Likewise, in that it saith, “And they took them to themselves for wives,”8891 it does so on
this ground, that, of course, such are “received for wives” as are devoid of that title. But it
would have expressed itself differently concerning such as were not thus devoid. And so
(they who are named) are devoid as much of widowhood as of virginity. So completely has
Paul by naming the sex generally, mingled “daughters” and species together in the genus.
Again, while he says that “nature herself,”8892 which has assigned hair as a tegument and
ornament to women, “teaches that veiling is the duty of females,” has not the same tegument
and the same honour of the head been assigned also to virgins? If “it is shameful” for a

the first8896 a virgin was named “female.” This custom,8897 in short, even Israel observes;
but if Israel did not observe it, our Law,8898 amplified and supplemented, would vindicate
the addition for itself; let it be excused for imposing the veil on virgins also. Under our
dispensation, let that age which is ignorant of its sex8899 retain the privilege of simplicity.
For both Eve and Adam, when it befell them to be “wise,”8900 forthwith veiled what they
had learnt to know.8901 At all events, with regard to those in whom girlhood has changed
(into maturity), their age ought to remember its duties as to nature, so also, to discipline;
for they are being transferred to the rank of “women” both in their persons and in their
functions. No one is a “virgin” from the time when she is capable of marriage; seeing that,
in her, age has by that time been wedded to its own husband, that is, to time.8902 “But some
particular virgin has devoted herself to God. From that very moment she both changes the
fashion of her hair, and converts all her garb into that of a ‘woman.’” Let her, then, maintain
the character wholly, and perform the whole function of a “virgin:” what she conceals8903
for the sake of God, let her cover quite over.8904 It is our business to entrust to the knowledge
of God alone that which the grace of God effects in us, lest we receive from man the reward

men?8907 Will you be more modest in public than in the church? If your self-devotion is a
grace of God, and you have received it, “why do you boast,” saith he, “as if you have not received
it?”8908 Why, by your ostentation of yourself, do you judge others? Is it that, by your
boasting, you invite others unto good? Nay, but even you yourself run the risk of losing, if
you boast; and you drive others unto the same perils! What is assumed from love of boasting
is easily destroyed. Be veiled, virgin, if virgin you are; for you ought to blush. If you are a
virgin, shrink from (the gaze of) many eyes. Let no one wonder at your face; let no one
perceive your falsehood.8909 You do well in falsely assuming the married character, if you
veil your head; nay, you do not seem to assume it falsely, for you are wedded to Christ: to
Him you have surrendered your body; act as becomes your Husband’s discipline. If He bids
the brides of others to be veiled, His own, of course, much more. “But each individual
man8910 is not to think that the institution of his predecessor is to be overturned.” Many
yield up their own judgment, and its consistency, to the custom of others. Granted that
virgins be not compelled to be veiled, at all events such as voluntarily are so should not be
prohibited; who, likewise, cannot deny themselves to be virgins,8911 content, in the security
of a good conscience before God, to damage their own fame.8912 Touching such, however,
as are betrothed, I can with constancy “above my small measure”8913 pronounce and attest
that they are to be veiled from that day forth on which they shuddered at the first bodily
touch of a man by kiss and hand. For in them everything has been forewedded: their age,
through maturity; their flesh, through age; their spirit, through consciousness; their modesty,
through the experience of the kiss their hope, through expectation; their mind through volition.
And Rebecca is example enough for us, who, when her betrothed had been pointed
out, veiled herself for marriage merely on recognition of him.8914</p>

<head>Chapter XXIII.—Of Kneeling.</head>
<p>In the matter of kneeling also prayer is subject to diversity of observance, through the
act of some few who abstain from kneeling on the Sabbath; and since this dissension is
particularly on its trial before the churches, the Lord will give His grace that the dissentients
may either yield, or else indulge their opinion without offence to others. We, however (just
as we have received), only on the day of the Lord’s Resurrection ought to guard not only
against kneeling, but every posture and office of solicitude; deferring even our businesses
lest we give any place to the devil.8915 Similarly, too, in the period of Pentecost; which
period we distinguish by the same solemnity of exultation.8916 But who would hesitate every
day to prostrate himself before God, at least in the first prayer with which we enter on the
daylight? At fasts, moreover, and Stations, no prayer should be made without kneeling, and
the remaining customary marks of humility; for (then)8917 we are not only praying, but
deprecating, and making satisfaction to God our Lord.8918 Touching times of prayer nothing
at all has been prescribed, except clearly “to pray at every time and every place.”8919</p>

<head>Chapter XXV.—Of Time for Prayer.</head>
<p>Touching the time, however, the extrinsic8924 observance of certain hours will not be
unprofitable—those common hours, I mean, which mark the intervals of the day—the third,
the sixth, the ninth—which we may find in the Scriptures to have been more solemn than
the rest. The first infusion of the Holy Spirit into the congregated disciples took place at
“the third hour.”8925 Peter, on the day on which he experienced the vision of Universal
Community,8926 (exhibited) in that small vessel,8927 had ascended into the more lofty parts
of the house, for prayer’s sake “at the sixth hour.”8928 The same (apostle) was going into the
temple, with John, “at the ninth hour,”8929 when he restored the paralytic to his health.
Albeit these practices stand simply without any precept for their observance, still it may be
granted a good thing to establish some definite presumption, which may both add stringency
to the admonition to pray, and may, as it were by a law, tear us out from our businesses
unto such a duty; so that—what we read to have been observed by Daniel also,8930 in accordance
(of course) with Israel’s discipline—we pray at least not less than thrice in the day,
debtors as we are to Three—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit: of course, in addition to our regular
prayers which are due, without any admonition, on the entrance of light and of night.
But, withal, it becomes believers not to take food, and not to go to the bath, before interposing
a prayer; for the refreshments and nourishments of the spirit are to be held prior to those
of the flesh, and things heavenly prior to things earthly.</p>
<note type="footnote">8924 Mr. Dodgson supposes this word to mean “outward, as contrasted with the inward, ‘praying always.’”
Oehler interprets, “ex vita communi.” But perhaps what Tertullian says lower down in the chapter, “albeit they
stand simply without any precept enjoining their observance,” may give us the true clue to his meaning; so that
“extrinsecus” would ="extrinsic to any direct injunction of our Lord or His apostles.”</note>

lest perhaps he be “an angel.” But again, when received yourself by brethren, you will not

required these from your hands?”8937 What, then, God has required the Gospel teaches.
“An hour will come,” saith He, “when the true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and
truth. For God is a Spirit, and accordingly requires His adorers to be such.”8938 We are the
true adorers and the true priests,8939 who, praying in spirit,8940 sacrifice, in spirit, prayer,—a
victim proper and acceptable to God, which assuredly He has required, which He has looked
forward to8941 for Himself! This victim, devoted from the whole heart, fed on faith, tended
by truth, entire in innocence, pure in chastity, garlanded with love,8942 we ought to escort

<head>Chapter XXIX.—Of the Power of Prayer.</head>
<p>For what has God, who exacts it ever denied8945 to prayer coming from “spirit and
truth?” How mighty specimens of its efficacy do we read, and hear, and believe! Old-world
prayer, indeed, used to free from fires,8946 and from beasts,8947 and from famine;8948 and
yet it had not (then) received its form from Christ. But how far more amply operative is
Christian prayer! It does not station the angel of dew in mid-fires,8949 nor muzzle lions, nor
transfer to the hungry the rustics’ bread;8950 it has no delegated grace to avert any sense of
suffering;8951 but it supplies the suffering, and the feeling, and the grieving, with endurance:
it amplifies grace by virtue, that faith may know what she obtains from the Lord, understanding
what—for God’s name’s sake—she suffers. But in days gone by, withal prayer used to
call down8952 plagues, scatter the armies of foes, withhold the wholesome influences of the
showers. Now, however, the prayer of righteousness averts all God’s anger, keeps bivouac
on behalf of personal enemies, makes supplication on behalf of persecutors. Is it wonder if
it knows how to extort the rains of heaven8953—(prayer) which was once able to procure
its fires?8954 Prayer is alone that which vanquishes8955 God. But Christ has willed that it be
operative for no evil: He had conferred on it all its virtue in the cause of good. And so it
knows nothing save how to recall the souls of the departed from the very path of death, to
transform the weak, to restore the sick, to purge the possessed, to open prison-bars, to loose
the bonds of the innocent. Likewise it washes away faults, repels temptations, extinguishes
persecutions, consoles the faint-spirited, cheers the high-spirited, escorts travellers, appeases
waves, makes robbers stand aghast, nourishes the poor, governs the rich, upraises the fallen,
arrests the falling, confirms the standing. Prayer is the wall of faith: her arms and missiles8956
against the foe who keeps watch over us on all sides. And, so never walk we unarmed. By

<p>Blessed Martyrs Designate,—Along with the provision which our lady mother the
Church from her bountiful breasts, and each brother out of his private means, makes for
your bodily wants in the prison, accept also from me some contribution to your spiritual
sustenance; for it is not good that the flesh be feasted and the spirit starve: nay, if that which
is weak be carefully looked to, it is but right that that which is still weaker should not be
neglected. Not that I am specially entitled to exhort you; yet not only the trainers and overseers,
but even the unskilled, nay, all who choose, without the slightest need for it, are wont
to animate from afar by their cries the most accomplished gladiators, and from the mere
throng of onlookers useful suggestions have sometimes come; first, then, O blessed, grieve
not the Holy Spirit,8962 who has entered the prison with you; for if He had not gone with
you there, you would not have been there this day. Do you give all endeavour, therefore, to
retain Him; so let Him lead you thence to your Lord. The prison, indeed, is the devil’s house
as well, wherein he keeps his family. But you have come within its walls for the very purpose
of trampling the wicked one under foot in his chosen abode. You had already in pitched
battle outside utterly overcome him; let him have no reason, then, to say to himself, “They
are now in my domain; with vile hatreds I shall tempt them, with defections or dissensions
among themselves.” Let him fly from your presence, and skulk away into his own abysses,
shrunken and torpid, as though he were an outcharmed or smoked-out snake. Give him
not the success in his own kingdom of setting you at variance with each other, but let him
find you armed and fortified with concord; for peace among you is battle with him. Some,
not able to find this peace in the Church, have been used to seek it from the imprisoned
martyrs.8963 And so you ought to have it dwelling with you, and to cherish it, and to guard
it, that you may be able perhaps to bestow it upon others.</p>

<p>Other things, hindrances equally of the soul, may have accompanied you as far as the
prison gate, to which also your relatives may have attended you. There and thenceforth you
were severed from the world; how much more from the ordinary course of worldly life and
all its affairs! Nor let this separation from the world alarm you; for if we reflect that the
world is more really the prison, we shall see that you have gone out of a prison rather than
into one. The world has the greater darkness, blinding men’s hearts. The world imposes the
more grievous fetters, binding men’s very souls. The world breathes out the worst impurities—
human lusts. The world contains the larger number of criminals, even the whole human
race. Then, last of all, it awaits the judgment, not of the proconsul, but of God. Wherefore,
O blessed, you may regard yourselves as having been translated from a prison to, we may
say, a place of safety. It is full of darkness, but ye yourselves are light; it has bonds, but God
has made you free. Unpleasant exhalations are there, but ye are an odour of sweetness. The
judge is daily looked for, but ye shall judge the judges themselves. Sadness may be there for
him who sighs for the world’s enjoyments. The Christian outside the prison has renounced
the world, but in the prison he has renounced a prison too. It is of no consequence where
you are in the world—you who are not of it. And if you have lost some of life’s sweets, it is
the way of business to suffer present loss, that after gains may be the larger. Thus far I say
nothing of the rewards to which God invites the martyrs. Meanwhile let us compare the life
of the world and of the prison, and see if the spirit does not gain more in the prison than
the flesh loses. Nay, by the care of the Church and the love of the brethren,8964 even the
flesh does not lose there what is for its good, while the spirit obtains besides important advantages.
You have no occasion to look on strange gods, you do not run against their images;
you have no part in heathen holidays, even by mere bodily mingling in them; you are not
annoyed by the foul fumes of idolatrous solemnities; you are not pained by the noise of the
public shows, nor by the atrocity or madness or immodesty of their celebrants; your eyes
do not fall on stews and brothels; you are free from causes of offence, from temptations,
from unholy reminiscences; you are free now from persecution too. The prison does the
same service for the Christian which the desert did for the prophet. Our Lord Himself spent
much of His time in seclusion, that He might have greater liberty to pray, that He might be
quit of the world. It was in a mountain solitude, too, He showed His glory to the disciples.
Let us drop the name of prison; let us call it a place of retirement. Though the body is shut
in, though the flesh is confined, all things are open to the spirit. In spirit, then, roam abroad;

in spirit walk about, not setting before you shady paths or long colonnades, but the way

<p>Grant now, O blessed, that even to Christians the prison is unpleasant; yet we were
called to the warfare of the living God in our very response to the sacramental words. Well,
no soldier comes out to the campaign laden with luxuries, nor does he go to action from
his comfortable chamber, but from the light and narrow tent, where every kind of hardness,
roughness and unpleasantness must be put up with. Even in peace soldiers inure themselves
to war by toils and inconveniences—marching in arms, running over the plain, working at
the ditch, making the testudo, engaging in many arduous labours. The sweat of the brow is
on everything, that bodies and minds may not shrink at having to pass from shade to sunshine,
from sunshine to icy cold, from the robe of peace to the coat of mail, from silence to
clamour, from quiet to tumult. In like manner, O blessed ones, count whatever is hard in
this lot of yours as a discipline of your powers of mind and body. You are about to pass
through a noble struggle, in which the living God acts the part of superintendent, in which
the Holy Ghost is your trainer, in which the prize is an eternal crown of angelic essence,
citizenship in the heavens, glory everlasting. Therefore your Master, Jesus Christ, who has
anointed you with His Spirit, and led you forth to the arena, has seen it good, before the day
of conflict, to take you from a condition more pleasant in itself, and has imposed on you a
harder treatment, that your strength might be the greater. For the athletes, too, are set apart
to a more stringent discipline, that they may have their physical powers built up. They are
kept from luxury, from daintier meats, from more pleasant drinks; they are pressed, racked,
worn out; the harder their labours in the preparatory training, the stronger is the hope of
victory. “And they,” says the apostle, “that they may obtain a corruptible crown.”8966 We,
with the crown eternal in our eye, look upon the prison as our training-ground, that at the
goal of final judgment we may be brought forth well disciplined by many a trial; since virtue
is built up by hardships, as by voluptuous indulgence it is overthrown.</p>

<p>From the saying of our Lord we know that the flesh is weak, the spirit willing.8967 Let
us not, withal, take delusive comfort from the Lord’s acknowledgment of the weakness of
the flesh. For precisely on this account He first declared the spirit willing, that He might
show which of the two ought to be subject to the other—that the flesh might yield obedience
to the spirit—the weaker to the stronger; the former thus from the latter getting strength.
Let the spirit hold convene with the flesh about the common salvation, thinking no longer
of the troubles of the prison, but of the wrestle and conflict for which they are the preparation.
The flesh, perhaps, will dread the merciless sword, and the lofty cross, and the rage of the
wild beasts, and that punishment of the flames, of all most terrible, and all the skill of the
executioner in torture. But, on the other side, let the spirit set clearly before both itself and
the flesh, how these things, though exceeding painful, have yet been calmly endured by
many,—and, have even been eagerly desired for the sake of fame and glory; and this not
only in the case of men, but of women too, that you, O holy women, may be worthy of your
sex. It would take me too long to enumerate one by one the men who at their own self-impulse
have put an end to themselves. As to women, there is a famous case at hand: the violated
Lucretia, in the presence of her kinsfolk, plunged the knife into herself, that she might have
glory for her chastity. Mucius burned his right hand on an altar, that this deed of his might
dwell in fame. The philosophers have been outstripped,—for instance Heraclitus, who,
smeared with cow dung, burned himself; and Empedocles, who leapt down into the fires of
Ætna; and Peregrinus,8968 who not long ago threw himself on the funeral pile. For women
even have despised the flames. Dido did so, lest, after the death of a husband very dear to
her, she should be compelled to marry again; and so did the wife of Hasdrubal, who, Carthage
being on fire, that she might not behold her husband suppliant as Scipio’s feet, rushed with
her children into the conflagration, in which her native city was destroyed. Regulus, a Roman
general, who had been taken prisoner by the Carthaginians, declined to be exchanged for a
large number of Carthaginian captives, choosing rather to be given back to the enemy. He
was crammed into a sort of chest; and, everywhere pierced by nails driven from the outside,
he endured so many crucifixions. Woman has voluntarily sought the wild beasts, and even
asps, those serpents worse than bear or bull, which Cleopatra applied to herself, that she
might not fall into the hands of her enemy. But the fear of death is not so great as the fear
of torture. And so the Athenian courtezan succumbed to the executioner, when, subjected
to torture by the tyrant for having taken part in a conspiracy, still making no betrayal of her
confederates, she at last bit off her tongue and spat it in the tyrant’s face, that he might be
convinced of the uselessness of his torments, however long they should be continued.

Everybody knows what to this day is the great Lacedæmonian solemnity—the διαμαστύγωσις,
or scourging; in which sacred rite the Spartan youths are beaten with scourges before the
altar, their parents and kinsmen standing by and exhorting them to stand it bravely out.
For it will be always counted more honourable and glorious that the soul rather than the
body has given itself to stripes. But if so high a value is put on the earthly glory, won by
mental and bodily vigour, that men, for the praise of their fellows, I may say, despise the
sword, the fire, the cross, the wild beasts, the torture; these surely are but trifling sufferings
to obtain a celestial glory and a divine reward. If the bit of glass is so precious, what must
the true pearl be worth? Are we not called on, then, most joyfully to lay out as much for the

<p>I leave out of account now the motive of glory. All these same cruel and painful conflicts,
a mere vanity you find among men—in fact, a sort of mental disease—as trampled under
foot. How many ease-lovers does the conceit of arms give to the sword? They actually go
down to meet the very wild beasts in vain ambition; and they fancy themselves more winsome
from the bites and scars of the contest. Some have sold themselves to fires, to run a certain
distance in a burning tunic. Others, with most enduring shoulders, have walked about under
the hunters’ whips. The Lord has given these things a place in the world, O blessed, not
without some reason: for what reason, but now to animate us, and on that day to confound
us if we have feared to suffer for the truth, that we might be saved, what others out of vanity
have eagerly sought for to their ruin?</p>

<p>Passing, too, from examples of enduring constancy having such an origin as this, let us
turn to a simple contemplation of man’s estate in its ordinary conditions, that mayhap from
things which happen to us whether we will or no, and which we must set our minds to bear,
we may get instruction. How often, then, have fires consumed the living! How often have
wild beasts torn men in pieces, it may be in their own forests, or it may be in the heart of
cities, when they have chanced to escape from their dens! How many have fallen by the
robber’s sword! How many have suffered at the hands of enemies the death of the cross,
after having been tortured first, yes, and treated with every sort of contumely! One may
even suffer in the cause of a man what he hesitates to suffer in the cause of God. In reference
to this indeed, let the present time8969 bear testimony, when so many persons of rank have
met with death in a mere human being’s cause, and that though from their birth and dignities
and bodily condition and age such a fate seemed most unlikely; either suffering at his hands

Appendix.</head>
<p>Introductory Notice to the Martyrdom of Perpetua and Felicitas.</p>
<p>[Translated by the Rev. R. E. Wallis, Ph.D.]</p>
<p>Nobody, will blame me for placing here the touching history of these Martyrs. It illustrates
the period of history we are now considering, and sheds light on the preceding treatise.
I can hardly read it without tears, and it ought to make us love “the noble army of martyrs.”
I think Tertullian was the editor of the story, not its author.8970 Felicitas is mentioned by
name in the De Anima: and the closing paragraph of this memoir is quite in his style. To
these words I need only add that Dr. Routh, who unfortunately decided not to re-edit it,
ascribes the first edition to Lucas Holstenius. He was Librarian of the Vatican and died in
1661. The rest may be learned from this Introductory Notice of the Translator:</p>
<p>Perpetua and Felicitas suffered martyrdom in the reign of Septimius Severus, about the
year 202 a.d. Tertullian mentions Perpetua,8971 and a further clue to the date is given in the
allusion to the birth-day of “Geta the Cæsar,” the son of Septimius Severus. There is therefore,
good reason for rejecting the opinion held by some, that they suffered under Valerian and
Gallienus. Some think that they suffered at Tuburbium in Mauritania; but the more general
opinion is, that Carthage was the scene of their martyrdom.</p>
<p>The “Acta,” detailing the sufferings of Perpetua and Felicitas, has been held by all critics
to be a genuine document of antiquity. But much difference exists as to who was the compiler.
In the writing itself, Perpetua and Saturus are mentioned as having written certain portions
of it; and there is no reason to doubt the statement. Who the writer of the remaining portion
was, is not known. Some have assigned the work to Tertullian; some have maintained that,
whoever the writer was, he was a Montanist, and some have tried to show that both martyrs
and narrator were Montanists.8972 The narrator must have been a contemporary; according
to many critics, he was an eye-witness of the sufferings of the martyrs. And he must have
written the narrative shortly after the events.</p>

he mentioned by name.</note>

<p>Dean Milman says, “There appear strong indications that the acts of these African
martyrs are translated from the Greek; at least it is difficult otherwise to account for the
frequent untranslated Greek words and idioms in the text.8973</p>
<p>The Passion of Perpetua and Felicitas was edited by Petrus Possinus, Rome, 1663; by
Henr. Valesius, Paris, 1664; and the Bollandists. The best and latest edition is by Ruissart,
whose text is adopted in Gallandi’s and Migne’s collections of the Fathers.</p>

<head>The Passion of the Holy Martyrs Perpetua and Felicitas.</head>

 <div type="commentary" subtype="preface">
<head>Preface.8974</head>
<p>If ancient illustrations of faith which both testify to God’s grace and tend to man’s edification
are collected in writing, so that by the perusal of them, as if by the reproduction of
the facts, as well God may be honoured, as man may be strengthened; why should not new
instances be also collected, that shall be equally suitable for both purposes,—if only on the
ground that these modern examples will one day become ancient and available for posterity,
although in their present time they are esteemed of less authority, by reason of the presumed
veneration for antiquity? But let men look to it, if they judge the power of the Holy Spirit
to be one, according to the times and seasons; since some things of later date must be esteemed
of more account as being nearer to the very last times, in accordance with the exuberance
of grace manifested to the final periods determined for the world. For “in the last
days, saith the Lord, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and their sons and their
daughters shall prophesy. And upon my servants and my handmaidens will I pour out of
my Spirit; and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.”8975
And thus we—who both acknowledge and reverence, even as we do the prophecies, modern
visions as equally promised to us, and consider the other powers of the Holy Spirit as an
agency of the Church for which also He was sent, administering all gifts in all, even as the
Lord distributed to every one8976 as well needfully collect them in writing, as commemorate
them in reading to God’s glory; that so no weakness or despondency of faith may suppose
that the divine grace abode only among the ancients, whether in respect of the condescension
that raised up martyrs, or that gave revelations; since God always carries into effect what
He has promised, for a testimony to unbelievers, to believers for a benefit. And we therefore,
what we have heard and handled, declare also to you, brethren and little children, that as
well you who were concerned in these matters may be reminded of them again to the glory
of the Lord, as that you who know them by report may have communion with the blessed
martyrs, and through them with the Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and honour, for
ever and ever.8977 Amen.</p>

<head>Chapter I.—Argument.—When the Saints Were Apprehended, St. Perpetua Successfully
Resisted Her Father’s Pleading, Was Baptized with the Others, Was Thrust
into a Filthy Dungeon. Anxious About Her Infant, by a Vision Granted to Her,
She Understood that Her Martyrdom Would Take Place Very Shortly.</head>
<p>1. The young catechumens, Revocatus and his fellow-servant Felicitas, Saturninus and
Secundulus, were apprehended. And among them also was Vivia Perpetua, respectably born,
liberally educated, a married matron, having a father and mother and two brothers, one of
whom, like herself, was a catechumen, and a son an infant at the breast. She herself was
about twenty-two years of age. From this point onward she shall herself narrate the whole
course of her martyrdom, as she left it described by her own hand and with her own mind.</p>
<p>2. “While” says she, “we were still with the persecutors, and my father, for the sake of
his affection for me, was persisting in seeking to turn me away, and to cast me down from
the faith,—‘Father,’ said I, ‘do you see, let us say, this vessel lying here to be a little pitcher,
or something else?’ And he said, ‘I see it to be so.’ And I replied to him, ‘Can it be called by
any other name than what it is?’ And he said, ‘No.’ ‘Neither can I call myself anything else
than what I am, a Christian.’ Then my father, provoked at this saying, threw himself upon
me, as if he would tear my eyes out. But he only distressed me, and went away overcome by
the devil’s arguments. Then, in a few days after I had been without my father, I gave thanks
to the Lord; and his absence became a source of consolation8978 to me. In that same interval
of a few days we were baptized, and to me the Spirit prescribed that in the water of baptism
nothing else was to be sought for bodily endurance.8979 After a few days we are taken into
the dungeon, and I was very much afraid, because I had never felt such darkness. O terrible
day! O the fierce heat of the shock of the soldiery, because of the crowds! I was very unusually
distressed by my anxiety for my infant. There were present there Tertius and Pomponius,
the blessed deacons who ministered to us, and had arranged by means of a gratuity that we
might be refreshed by being sent out for a few hours into a pleasanter part of the prison.
Then going out of the dungeon, all attended to their own wants.8980 I suckled my child,
which was now enfeebled with hunger. In my anxiety for it, I addressed my mother and
comforted my brother, and commended to their care my son. I was languishing because I
had seen them languishing on my account. Such solicitude I suffered for many days, and I
obtained for my infant to remain in the dungeon with me; and forthwith I grew strong and
was relieved from distress and anxiety about my infant; and the dungeon became to me as
it were a palace, so that I preferred being there to being elsewhere.</p>

<p>3. “Then my brother said to me, ‘My dear sister, you are already in a position of great
dignity, and are such that you may ask for a vision, and that it may be made known to you
whether this is to result in a passion or an escape.’8981 And I, who knew that I was privileged
to converse with the Lord, whose kindnesses I had found to be so great, boldly promised
him, and said, ‘To-morrow I will tell you.’ And I asked, and this was what was shown me.
I saw a golden ladder of marvellous height, reaching up even to heaven, and very narrow,
so that persons could only ascend it one by one; and on the sides of the ladder was fixed
every kind of iron weapon. There were there swords, lances, hooks, daggers; so that if any
one went up carelessly, or not looking upwards, he would be torn to pieces and his flesh
would cleave to the iron weapons. And under the ladder itself was crouching a dragon of
wonderful size, who lay in wait for those who ascended, and frightened them from the ascent.
And Saturus went up first, who had subsequently delivered himself up freely on our account,
not having been present at the time that we were taken prisoners. And he attained the top
of the ladder, and turned towards me, and said to me, ‘Perpetua, I am waiting for8982 you;
but be careful that the dragon do not bite you.’ And I said, ‘In the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ, he shall not hurt me.’ And from under the ladder itself, as if in fear of me, he slowly
lifted up his head; and as I trod upon the first step, I trod upon his head. And I went up,
and I saw an immense extent of garden, and in the midst of the garden a white-haired man
sitting in the dress of a shepherd,8983 of a large stature, milking sheep; and standing around
were many thousand white-robed ones. And he raised his head, and looked upon me, and
said to me, ‘Thou art welcome, daughter.’ And he called me, and from the cheese as he was
milking he gave me as it were a little cake, and I received it with folded hands; and I ate it,
and all who stood around said Amen. And at the sound of their voices I was awakened, still
tasting a sweetness which I cannot describe. And I immediately related this to my brother,
and we understood that it was to be a passion, and we ceased henceforth to have any hope
in this world.</p>

<p>1. “After a few days there prevailed a report that we should be heard. And then my
father came to me from the city, worn out with anxiety. He came up to me, that he might
cast me down, saying, ‘Have pity my daughter, on my grey hairs. Have pity on your father,
if I am worthy to be called a father by you. If with these hands I have brought you up to this
flower of your age, if I have preferred you to all your brothers, do not deliver me up to the
scorn of men. Have regard to your brothers, have regard to your mother and your aunt,
have regard to your son, who will not be able to live after you. Lay aside your courage, and
do not bring us all to destruction; for none of us will speak in freedom if you should suffer
anything.’ These things said my father in his affection, kissing my hands, and throwing
himself at my feet; and with tears he called me not Daughter, but Lady. And I grieved over
the grey hairs of my father, that he alone of all my family would not rejoice over my passion.
And I comforted him, saying, ‘On that scaffold8984 whatever God wills shall happen. For
know that we are not placed in our own power, but in that of God.’ And he departed from
me in sorrow.</p>
<p>2. “Another day, while we were at dinner, we were suddenly taken away to be heard,
and we arrived at the town-hall. At once the rumour spread through the neighbourhood of
the public place, and an immense number of people were gathered together. We mount
the platform. The rest were interrogated, and confessed. Then they came to me, and my
father immediately appeared with my boy, and withdrew me from the step, and said in a
supplicating tone, ‘Have pity on your babe.’ And Hilarianus the procurator, who had just
received the power of life and death in the place of the proconsul Minucius Timinianus,
who was deceased, said, ‘Spare the grey hairs of your father, spare the infancy of your boy,
offer sacrifice for the well-being of the emperors.’ And I replied, ‘I will not do so.’ Hilarianus
said, ‘Are you a Christian?’ And I replied, ‘I am a Christian.’ And as my father stood there
to cast me down from the faith, he was ordered by Hilarianus to be thrown down, and was
beaten with rods. And my father’s misfortune grieved me as if I myself had been beaten, I
so grieved for his wretched old age.8985 The procurator then delivers judgment on all of us,
and condemns us to the wild beasts, and we went down cheerfully to the dungeon. Then,
because my child had been used to receive suck from me, and to stay with me in the prison,
I send Pomponius the deacon to my father to ask for the infant, but my father would not

give it him. And even as God willed it, the child no long desired the breast, nor did my breast
cause me uneasiness, lest I should be tormented by care for my babe and by the pain of my
breasts at once.</p>
<p>3. “After a few days, whilst we were all praying, on a sudden, in the middle of our
prayer, there came to me a word, and I named Dinocrates; and I was amazed that that name
had never come into my mind until then, and I was grieved as I remembered his misfortune.
And I felt myself immediately to be worthy, and to be called on to ask on his behalf.8986
And for him I began earnestly to make supplication, and to cry with groaning to the Lord.
Without delay, on that very night, this was shown to me in a vision.8987 I saw Dinocrates
going out from a gloomy place, where also there were several others, and he was parched
and very thirsty, with a filthy countenance and pallid colour, and the wound on his face
which he had when he died. This Dinocrates had been my brother after the flesh, seven
years of age8988 who died miserably with disease—his face being so eaten out with cancer,
that his death caused repugnance to all men. For him I had made my prayer, and between
him and me there was a large interval,8989 so that neither of us could approach to the other.
And moreover, in the same place where Dinocrates was, there was a pool full of water,
having its brink higher than was the stature of the boy; and Dinocrates raised himself up as
if to drink. And I was grieved that, although that pool held water, still, on account of the
height to its brink, he could not drink. And I was aroused, and knew that my brother was

visitations of the Divine compassion. But, obviously, even were it not an Apocryphal text, it can have no bearing

Could the gulf be bridged and they received into Abraham’s bosom? This dream of Perpetua comforted her
with a trust that so it should be. Of course this story has been used fraudulently, to help a system of which these
times knew nothing. Cyprian says expressly: “Apud Inferos confessio, non est, nec exomologesis illic fieri potest.”

in suffering. But I trusted that my prayer would bring help to his suffering; and I prayed for
him every day until we passed over into the prison of the camp, for we were to fight in the
camp-show. Then was the birth-day of Geta Cæsar, and I made my prayer for my brother
day and night, groaning and weeping that he might be granted to me.</p>

that that place which I had formerly observed to be in gloom was now bright; and Dinocrates,
with a clean body well clad, was finding refreshment. And where there had been a wound,
I saw a scar; and that pool which I had before seen, I saw now with its margin lowered even
to the boy’s navel. And one drew water from the pool incessantly, and upon its brink was a
goblet filled with water; and Dinocrates drew near and began to drink from it, and the
goblet did not fail. And when he was satisfied, he went away from the water to play joyously,
after the manner of children, and I awoke. Then I understood that he was translated from
the place of punishment.</p>

<head>Chapter III.—Argument. Perpetua is Again Tempted by Her Father. Her Third
Vision, Wherein She is Led Away to Struggle Against an Egyptian. She Fights,
Conquers, and Receives the Reward.</head>
<p>1. “Again, after a few days, Pudens, a soldier, an assistant overseer8991 of the prison,
who began to regard us in great esteem, perceiving that the great power of God was in us,
admitted many brethren to see us, that both we and they might be mutually refreshed. And
when the day of the exhibition drew near, my father, worn with suffering, came in to me,
and began to tear out his beard, and to throw himself on the earth, and to cast himself down
on his face, and to reproach his years, and to utter such words as might move all creation.
I grieved for his unhappy old age.8992</p>
<p>2. “The day before that on which we were to fight, I saw in a vision that Pomponius the
deacon came hither to the gate of the prison, and knocked vehemently. I went out to him,
and opened the gate for him; and he was clothed in a richly ornamented white robe, and he
had on manifold calliculæ.8993 And he said to me, ‘Perpetua, we are waiting for you; come!’
And he held his hand to me, and we began to go through rough and winding places. Scarcely
at length had we arrived breathless at the amphitheatre, when he led me into the middle of
the arena, and said to me, ‘Do not fear, I am here with you, and I am labouring with you;’
and he departed. And I gazed upon an immense assembly in astonishment. And because I
knew that I was given to the wild beasts, I marvelled that the wild beasts were not let loose
upon me. Then there came forth against me a certain Egyptian, horrible in appearance, with
his backers, to fight with me. And there came to me, as my helpers and encouragers, handsome
youths; and I was stripped, and became a man.8994 Then my helpers began to rub me
with oil, as is the custom for contest; and I beheld that Egyptian on the other hand rolling
in the dust.8995 And a certain man came forth, of wondrous height, so that he even overtopped
the top of the amphitheatre; and he wore a loose tunic and a purple robe between
two bands over the middle of the breast; and he had on calliculæ of varied form, made of
gold and silver; and he carried a rod, as if he were a trainer of gladiators, and a green branch
upon which were apples of gold. And he called for silence, and said, ‘This Egyptian, if he

she shall receive this branch.’ Then he departed. And we drew near to one another, and
began to deal out blows. He sought to lay hold of my feet, while I struck at his face with my
heels; and I was lifted up in the air, and began thus to thrust at him as if spurning the earth.
But when I saw that there was some delay I joined my hands so as to twine my fingers with
one another; and I took hold upon his head, and he fell on his face, and I trod upon his
head.8996 And the people began to shout, and my backers to exult. And I drew near to the
trainer and took the branch; and he kissed me, and said to me, ‘Daughter, peace be with
you:’ and I began to go gloriously to the Sanavivarian gate.8997 Then I awoke, and perceived
that I was not to fight with beasts, but against the devil. Still I knew that the victory was
awaiting me. This, so far, I have completed several days before the exhibition; but what
passed at the exhibition itself let who will write.”</p>

into the Great Light, Behold the Martyrs. Being Brought to the Throne of God,
are Received with a Kiss. They Reconcile Optatus the Bishop and Aspasius the
Presbyter.</head>
<p>1. Moreover, also, the blessed Saturus related this his vision, which he himself committed
to writing:—“We had suffered,” says he, “and we were gone forth from the flesh, and we
were beginning to be borne by four angels into the east; and their hands touched us not.
And we floated not supine, looking upwards, but as if ascending a gentle slope. And being
set free, we at length saw the first boundless light; and I said, ‘Perpetua’ (for she was at my
side), ‘this is what the Lord promised to us; we have received the promise.’ And while we
are borne by those same four angels, there appears to us a vast space which was like a
pleasure-garden, having rose-trees and every kind of flower. And the height of the trees was
after the measure of a cypress, and their leaves were falling8998 incessantly. Moreover, there
in the pleasure-garden four other angels appeared, brighter than the previous ones, who,
when they saw us, gave us honour, and said to the rest of the angels, ‘Here they are! Here
they are!’ with admiration. And those four angels who bore us, being greatly afraid, put us
down; and we passed over on foot the space of a furlong in a broad path. There we found
Jocundus and Saturninus and Artaxius, who having suffered the same persecution were
burnt alive; and Quintus, who also himself a martyr had departed in the prison. And we
asked of them where the rest were. And the angels said to us, ‘Come first, enter and greet
your Lord.’</p>
<p>2. “And we came near to place, the walls of which were such as if they were built of light;
and before the gate of that place stood four angels, who clothed those who entered with
white robes. And being clothed, we entered and saw the boundless light, and heard the
united voice of some who said without ceasing, ‘Holy! Holy! Holy!’8999 And in the midst
of that place we saw as it were a hoary man sitting, having snow-white hair, and with a
youthful countenance; and his feet we saw not. And on his right hand and on his left were
four-and-twenty elders, and behind them a great many others were standing. We entered
with great wonder, and stood before the throne; and the four angels raised us up, and we
kissed Him, and He passed His hand over our face. And the rest of the elders said to us, ‘Let
us stand;’ and we stood and made peace. And the elders said to us, ‘Go and enjoy.’ And I
said, ‘Perpetua, you have what you wish.’ And she said to me, ‘Thanks be to God, that joyous
as I was in the flesh, I am now more joyous here.’</p>

<p>3. “And we went forth, and saw before the entrance Optatus the bishop at the right
hand, and Aspasius the presbyter, a teacher,9000 at the left hand, separate and sad; and they
cast themselves at our feet, and said to us, ‘Restore peace between us, because you have gone
forth and have left us thus.’ And we said to them, ‘Art not thou our father, and thou our
presbyter, that you should cast yourselves at our feet?’ And we prostrated ourselves, and we
embraced them; and Perpetua began to speak with them, and we drew them apart in the
pleasure-garden under a rose-tree. And while we were speaking with them, the angels said
unto them, ‘Let them alone, that they may refresh themselves;9001 and if you have any dissensions
between you, forgive one another.’ And they drove them away. And they said to
Optatus, ‘Rebuke thy people, because they assemble to you as if returning from the circus,
and contending about factious matters.’ And then it seemed to us as if they would shut the
doors. And in that place we began to recognise many brethren, and moreover martyrs. We
were all nourished with an indescribable odour, which satisfied us. Then, I joyously awoke.”</p>

<head>Chapter V.—Argument. Secundulus Dies in the Prison. Felicitas is Pregnant, But
with Many Prayers She Brings Forth in the Eighth Month Without Suffering,
the Courage of Perpetua and of Saturus Unbroken.</head>
<p>1. The above were the more eminent visions of the blessed martyrs Saturus and Perpetua
themselves, which they themselves committed to writing.9002 But God called Secundulus,
while he has yet in the prison, by an earlier exit from the world, not without favour, so as
to give a respite to the beasts. Nevertheless, even if his soul did not acknowledge cause for
thankfulness, assuredly his flesh did.</p>
<p>2. But respecting Felicitas (for to her also the Lord’s favour approached in the same
way), when she had already gone eight months with child (for she had been pregnant when
she was apprehended), as the day of the exhibition was drawing near, she was in great grief
lest on account of her pregnancy she should be delayed,—because pregnant women are not
allowed to be publicly punished,—and lest she should shed her sacred and guiltless blood
among some who had been wicked subsequently. Moreover, also, her fellow-martyrs were
painfully saddened lest they should leave so excellent a friend, and as it were companion,
alone in the path of the same hope. Therefore, joining together their united cry, they poured
forth their prayer to the Lord three days before the exhibition. Immediately after their
prayer her pains came upon her, and when, with the difficulty natural to an eight months’
delivery, in the labour of bringing forth she was sorrowing, some one of the servants of the
Cataractarii9003 said to her, “You who are in such suffering now, what will you do when
you are thrown to the beasts, which you despised when you refused to sacrifice?” And she
replied, “Now it is I that suffer what I suffer; but then there will be another in me, who will
suffer for me, because I also am about to suffer for Him.” Thus she brought forth a little
girl, which a certain sister brought up as her daughter.</p>
<p>3. Since then the Holy Spirit permitted, and by permitting willed, that the proceedings
of that exhibition should be committed to writing, although we are unworthy to complete
the description of so great a glory; yet we obey as it were the command of the most blessed
Perpetua, nay her sacred trust, and add one more testimony concerning her constancy and
her loftiness of mind. While they were treated with more severity by the tribune, because,
from the intimations of certain deceitful men, he feared lest they should be withdrawn from
the prison by some sort of magic incantations, Perpetua answered to his face, and said,
“Why do you not at least permit us to be refreshed, being as we are objectionable to the
most noble Cæsar, and having to fight on his birth-day?9004 Or is it not your glory if we are
brought forward fatter on that occasion?” The tribune shuddered and blushed, and com-

manded that they should be kept with more humanity, so that permission was given to their
brethren and others to go in and be refreshed with them; even the keeper of the prison
trusting them now himself.</p>
<p>4. Moreover, on the day before, when in that last meal, which they call the free meal,
they were partaking as far as they could, not of a free supper, but of an agape; with the same
firmness they were uttering such words as these to the people, denouncing against them the
judgment of the Lord, bearing witness to the felicity of their passion, laughing at the curiosity
of the people who came together; while Saturus said, “To-morrow is not enough for you,
for you to behold with pleasure that which you hate. Friends today, enemies to-morrow.
Yet note our faces diligently, that you may recognise them on that day of judgment.” Thus
all departed thence astonished, and from these things many believed.</p>

Twice is Unhurt. Perpetua and Felicitas are Thrown Down; They are Called Back
to the Sanavivarian Gate. Saturus Wounded by a Leopard, Exhorts the Soldier.
They Kiss One Another, and are Slain with the Sword.</head>
<p>1. The day of their victory shone forth, and they proceeded from the prison into the
amphitheatre, as if to an assembly, joyous and of brilliant countenances; if perchance
shrinking, it was with joy, and not with fear. Perpetua followed with placid look, and with
step and gait as a matron of Christ, beloved of God; casting down the luster of her eyes from
the gaze of all. Moreover, Felicitas, rejoicing that she had safely brought forth, so that she
might fight with the wild beasts; from the blood and from the midwife to the gladiator, to
wash after childbirth with a second baptism. And when they were brought to the gate, and
were constrained to put on the clothing—the men, that of the priests of Saturn, and the
women, that of those who were consecrated to Ceres—that noble-minded woman resisted
even to the end with constancy. For she said, “We have come thus far of our own accord,
for this reason, that our liberty might not be restrained. For this reason we have yielded our
minds, that we might not do any such thing as this: we have agreed on this with you.” Injustice
acknowledged the justice; the tribune yielded to their being brought as simply as they
were. Perpetua sang psalms, already treading under foot the head of the Egyptian; Revocatus,
and Saturninus, and Saturus uttered threatenings against the gazing people about this
martyrdom. When they came within sight of Hilarianus, by gesture and nod, they began to
say to Hilarianus, “Thou judgest us,” say they, “but God will judge thee.” At this the people,
exasperated, demanded that they should be tormented with scourges as they passed along
the rank of the venatores.9005 And they indeed rejoiced that they should have incurred any
one of their Lord’s passions.</p>
<p>2. But He who had said, “Ask, and ye shall receive,”9006 gave to them when they asked,
that death which each one had wished for. For when at any time they had been discoursing
among themselves about their wish in respect of their martyrdom, Saturninus indeed had
professed that he wished that he might be thrown to all the beasts; doubtless that he might
wear a more glorious crown. Therefore in the beginning of the exhibition he and Revocatus
made trial of the leopard, and moreover upon the scaffold they were harassed by the bear.
Saturus, however, held nothing in greater abomination than a bear; but he imagined that
<note type="footnote">9005 A row of men drawn up to scourge them as they passed along, a punishment probably similar to what
is called “running the gauntlet.”</note>
<note type="footnote">9006 John xvi. 24.</note>

<pb n="1575"/>
he would be put an end to with one bite of a leopard. Therefore, when a wild boar was supplied,
it was the huntsman rather who had supplied that boar who was gored by that same
beast, and died the day after the shows. Saturus only was drawn out; and when he had been
bound on the floor near to a bear, the bear would not come forth from his den. And so
Saturus for the second time is recalled unhurt.</p>
<p>3. Moreover, for the young women the devil prepared a very fierce cow, provided especially
for that purpose contrary to custom, rivalling their sex also in that of the beasts. And
so, stripped and clothed with nets, they were led forth. The populace shuddered as they saw
one young woman of delicate frame, and another with breasts still dropping from her recent
childbirth. So, being recalled, they are unbound.9007 Perpetua is first led in. She was tossed,
and fell on her loins; and when she saw her tunic torn from her side, she drew it over her
as a veil for her middle, rather mindful of her modesty than her suffering. Then she was
called for again, and bound up her dishevelled hair; for it was not becoming for a martyr to
suffer with dishevelled hair, lest she should appear to be mourning in her glory. So she rose
up; and when she saw Felicitas crushed, she approached and gave her her hand, and lifted
her up. And both of them stood together; and the brutality of the populace being appeased,
they were recalled to the Sanavivarian gate. Then Perpetua was received by a certain one
who was still a catechumen, Rusticus by name, who kept close to her; and she, as if aroused
from sleep, so deeply had she been in the Spirit and in an ecstasy, began to look round her,
and to say to the amazement of all, “I cannot tell when we are to be led out to that cow.”
And when she had heard what had already happened, she did not believe it9008 until she
had perceived certain signs of injury in her body and in her dress, and had recognised the
catechumen. Afterwards causing that catechumen and the brother to approach, she addressed
them, saying, “Stand fast in the faith, and love one another, all of you, and be not offended
at my sufferings.”</p>
<p>4. The same Saturus at the other entrance exhorted the soldier Pudens, saying, “Assuredly
here I am, as I have promised and foretold, for up to this moment I have felt no beast. And
now believe with your whole heart. Lo, I am going forth to that beast, and I shall be destroyed
with one bite of the leopard.” And immediately at the conclusion of the exhibition he was
thrown to the leopard; and with one bite of his he was bathed with such a quantity of blood,
that the people shouted out to him as he was returning, the testimony of his second baptism,
“Saved and washed, saved and washed.”9009 Manifestly he was assuredly saved who had
been glorified in such a spectacle. Then to the soldier Pudens he said, “Farewell, and be

mindful of my faith; and let not these things disturb, but confirm you.” And at the same
time he asked for a little ring from his finger, and returned it to him bathed in his wound,
leaving to him an inherited token and the memory of his blood. And then lifeless he is cast
down with the rest, to be slaughtered in the usual place. And when the populace called for
them into the midst, that as the sword penetrated into their body they might make their
eyes partners in the murder, they rose up of their own accord, and transferred themselves
whither the people wished; but they first kissed one another, that they might consummate
their martyrdom with the kiss of peace. The rest indeed, immoveable and in silence, received
the sword-thrust; much more Saturus, who also had first ascended the ladder, and first gave
up his spirit, for he also was waiting for Perpetua. But Perpetua, that she might taste some
pain, being pierced between the ribs, cried out loudly, and she herself placed the wavering
right hand of the youthful gladiator to her throat.9010 Possibly such a woman could not
have been slain unless she herself had willed it, because she was feared by the impure spirit.</p>
<p>O most brave and blessed martyrs! O truly called and chosen unto the glory of our Lord
Jesus Christ! whom whoever magnifies, and honours, and adores, assuredly ought to read
these examples for the edification of the Church, not less than the ancient ones, so that new
virtues also may testify that one and the same Holy Spirit is always operating even until
now, and God the Father Omnipotent, and His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, whose is the glory
and infinite power for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>The avidity with which the Latin controversial writers seize upon this fanciful passage,
(which, in fact, is subversive of their whole doctrine about Purgatory, as is the text from the
Maccabees) makes emphatic the utter absence from the early Fathers of any reference to
such a dogma; which, had it existed, must have appeared in every reference to the State of
the Dead, and in every account of the discipline of penitents. Arbp. Usher9011 ingeniously
turns the tables upon these errorists, by quoting the Prayers for the Dead, which were used
in the Early Church, but which, such as they were, not only make no mention of a Purgatory,
but refute the dogma, by their uniform limitation of such prayers to the blessed dead, and
to their consummation of bliss at the Last day and not before. Such a prayer seems to occur
in 2 Tim. i. 18. The context (vers. 16–18, and iv. 19) strongly supports this view; Onesiphorus
is spoken of as if deceased, apparently. But, as Chrysostom understands it, he was only absent
(in Rome) from his household. From i. 17 we should infer that he had left Rome.9012</p>

 <div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>Chapter I.—Of Patience Generally; And Tertullian’s Own Unworthiness to Treat of
It.</head>
<p>I fully confess unto the Lord God that it has been rash enough, if not even impudent,
in me to have dared compose a treatise on Patience, for practising which I am all unfit, being
a man of no goodness;9014 whereas it were becoming that such as have addressed themselves
to the demonstration and commendation of some particular thing, should themselves first
be conspicuous in the practice of that thing, and should regulate the constancy of their
commonishing by the authority of their personal conduct, for fear their words blush at the
deficiency of their deeds. And would that this “blushing” would bring a remedy, so that
shame for not exhibiting that which we go to suggest to others should prove a tutorship into
exhibiting it; except that the magnitude of some good things—just as of some ills too—is
insupportable, so that only the grace of divine inspiration is effectual for attaining and
practising them. For what is most good rests most with God; nor does any other than He
who possesses it dispense it, as He deems meet to each. And so to discuss about that which
it is not given one to enjoy, will be, as it were, a solace; after the manner of invalids, who
since they are without health, know not how to be silent about its blessings. So I, most
miserable, ever sick with the heats of impatience, must of necessity sigh after, and invoke,
and persistently plead for, that health of patience which I possess not; while I recall to mind,
and, in the contemplation of my own weakness, digest, the truth, that the good health of
faith, and the soundness of the Lord’s discipline, accrue not easily to any unless patience sit
by his side.9015 So is patience set over the things of God, that one can obey no precept, fulfil
no work well-pleasing to the Lord, if estranged from it. The good of it, even they who live
outside it,9016 honour with the name of highest virtue. Philosophers indeed, who are accounted
animals of some considerable wisdom, assign it so high a place, that, while they are
mutually at discord with the various fancies of their sects and rivalries of their sentiments,

yet, having a community of regard for patience alone, to this one of their pursuits they have

<p>To us9020 no human affectation of canine9021 equanimity, modelled9022 by insensibility,
furnishes the warrant for exercising patience; but the divine arrangement of a living and
celestial discipline, holding up before us God Himself in the very first place as an example
of patience; who scatters equally over just and unjust the bloom of this light; who suffers
the good offices of the seasons, the services of the elements, the tributes of entire nature, to
accrue at once to worthy and unworthy; bearing with the most ungrateful nations, adoring
as they do the toys of the arts and the works of their own hands, persecuting His Name together
with His family; bearing with luxury, avarice, iniquity, malignity, waxing insolent

<head>Chapter III.—Jesus Christ in His Incarnation and Work a More Imitable Example
Thereof.</head>
<p>And this species of the divine patience indeed being, as it were, at a distance, may perhaps
be esteemed as among “things too high for us;”9026 but what is that which, in a certain way,
has been grasped by hand9027 among men openly on the earth? God suffers Himself to be
conceived in a mother’s womb, and awaits the time for birth; and, when born, bears the delay
of growing up; and, when grown up, is not eager to be recognised, but is furthermore contumelious
to Himself, and is baptized by His own servant; and repels with words alone the
assaults of the tempter; while from being “Lord” He becomes “Master,” teaching man to
escape death, having been trained to the exercise of the absolute forbearance of offended
patience.9028 He did not strive; He did not cry aloud; nor did any hear His voice in the
streets. He did not break the bruised reed; the smoking flax He did not quench: for the
prophet—nay, the attestation of God Himself, placing His own Spirit, together with patience
in its entirety, in His Son—had not falsely spoken. There was none desirous of cleaving to
Him whom He did not receive. No one’s table or roof did He despise: indeed, Himself
ministered to the washing of the disciples’ feet; not sinners, not publicans, did He repel; not
with that city even which had refused to receive Him was He wroth,9029 when even the
disciples had wished that the celestial fires should be forthwith hurled on so contumelious
a town. He cared for the ungrateful; He yielded to His ensnarers. This were a small matter,
if He had not had in His company even His own betrayer, and stedfastly abstained from
pointing him out. Moreover, while He is being betrayed, while He is being led up “as a sheep
for a victim,” (for “so He no more opens His mouth than a lamb under the power of the
shearer,”)He to whom, had He willed it, legions of angels would at one word have presented
themselves from the heavens, approved not the avenging sword of even one disciple. The
patience of the Lord was wounded in (the wound of) Malchus. And so, too, He cursed for
the time to come the works of the sword; and, by the restoration of health, made satisfaction
to him whom Himself had not hurt, through Patience, the mother of Mercy. I pass by in
silence (the fact) that He is crucified, for this was the end for which He had come; yet had
the death which must be undergone need of contumelies likewise?9030 Nay, but, when about
to depart, He wished to be sated with the pleasure of patience. He is spitted on, scourged,
derided, clad foully, more foully crowned. Wondrous is the faith of equanimity! He who

impatience! Hence, even more than from any other trait, ought ye, Pharisees, to have recognised
the Lord. Patience of this kind none of men would achieve. Such and so mighty evidences—
the very magnitude of which proves to be among the nations indeed a cause for rejection
of the faith, but among us its reason and rearing—proves manifestly enough (not
by the sermons only, in enjoining, but likewise by the sufferings of the Lord in enduring)
to them to whom it is given to believe, that as the effect and excellence of some inherent
propriety, patience is God’s nature.</p>

<head>Chapter IV.—Duty of Imitating Our Master Taught Us by Slaves. Even by Beasts.
Obedient Imitation is Founded on Patience.</head>
<p>Therefore, if we see all servants of probity and right feeling shaping their conduct suitably
to the disposition of their lord; if, that is, the art of deserving favour is obedience,9031 while
the rule of obedience is a compliant subjection: how much more does it behove us to be
found with a character in accordance with our Lord,—servants as we are of the living God,
whose judgment on His servants turns not on a fetter or a cap of freedom, but on an eternity
either of penalty or of salvation; for the shunning of which severity or the courting of which
liberality there needs a diligence in obedience9032 as great as are the comminations themselves
which the severity utters, or the promises which the liberality freely makes.9033 And yet we
exact obedience9034 not from men only, who have the bond of their slavery under their
chin,9035 or in any other legal way are debtors to obedience,9036 but even from cattle,9037
even from brutes;9038 understanding that they have been provided and delivered for our
uses by the Lord. Shall, then, creatures which God makes subject to us be better than we in
the discipline of obedience?9039 Finally, (the creatures) which obey, acknowledge their
masters. Do we hesitate to listen diligently to Him to whom alone we are subjected—that
is, the Lord? But how unjust is it, how ungrateful likewise, not to repay from yourself the
same which, through the indulgence of your neighbour, you obtain from others, to him
through whom you obtain it! Nor needs there more words on the exhibition of obedience9040
due from us to the Lord God; for the acknowledgment9041 of God understands what is incumbent
on it. Lest, however, we seem to have inserted remarks on obedience9042 as

Never does an impatient man render it, or a patient fail to find pleasure9044 in it. Who, then,
could treat largely (enough) of the good of that patience which the Lord God, the Demonstrator
and Acceptor of all good things, carried about in His own self?9045 To whom, again,
would it be doubtful that every good thing ought, because it pertains9046 to God, to be
earnestly pursued with the whole mind by such as pertain to God? By means of which

<head>Chapter V.—As God is the Author of Patience So the Devil is of Impatience.</head>
<p>Nevertheless, the proceeding9049 of a discussion on the necessaries of faith is not idle,
because it is not unfruitful. In edification no loquacity is base, if it be base at any time.9050
And so, if the discourse be concerning some particular good, the subject requires us to review
also the contrary of that good. For you will throw more light on what is to be pursued, if
you first give a digest of what is to be avoided.</p>
<p>Let us therefore consider, concerning Impatience, whether just as patience in God, so
its adversary quality have been born and detected in our adversary, that from this consideration
may appear how primarily adverse it is to faith. For that which has been conceived by
God’s rival, of course is not friendly to God’s things. The discord of things is the same as
the discord of their authors. Further, since God is best, the devil on the contrary worst, of
beings, by their own very diversity they testify that neither works for9051 the other; so that
anything of good can no more seem to be effected for us by the Evil One, than anything of
evil by the Good. Therefore I detect the nativity of impatience in the devil himself, at that
very time when he impatiently bore that the Lord God subjected the universal works which
He had made to His own image, that is, to man.9052 For if he had endured (that), he would
not have grieved; nor would he have envied man if he had not grieved. Accordingly he deceived
him, because he had envied him; but he had envied because he had grieved: he had
grieved because, of course, he had not patiently borne. What that angel of perdition9053 first
was—malicious or impatient—I scorn to inquire: since manifest it is that either impatience
took its rise together with malice, or else malice from impatience; that subsequently they
conspired between themselves; and that they grew up indivisible in one paternal bosom.
But, however, having been instructed, by his own experiment, what an aid unto sinning was
that which he had been the first to feel, and by means of which he had entered on his course
of delinquency, he called the same to his assistance for the thrusting of man into crime. The
woman,9054 immediately on being met by him—I may say so without rashness—was, through
his very speech with her, breathed on by a spirit infected with impatience: so certain is it
that she would never have sinned at all, if she had honoured the divine edict by maintaining
her patience to the end. What (of the fact) that she endured not to have been met alone; but

in the presence of Adam, not yet her husband, not yet bound to lend her his ears,9055 she
is impatient of keeping silence, and makes him the transmitter of that which she had imbibed
from the Evil One? Therefore another human being, too, perishes through the impatience
of the one; presently, too, perishes of himself, through his own impatience committed in
each respect, both in regard of God’s premonition and in regard of the devil’s cheatery; not
enduring to observe the former nor to refute the latter. Hence, whence (the origin) of delinquency,
arose the first origin of judgment; hence, whence man was induced to offend, God
began to be wroth. Whence (came) the first indignation in God, thence (came) His first
patience; who, content at that time with malediction only, refrained in the devil’s case from
the instant infliction9056 of punishment. Else what crime, before this guilt of impatience, is
imputed to man? Innocent he was, and in intimate friendship with God, and the husbandman9057
of paradise. But when once he succumbed to impatience, he quite ceased to be of
sweet savour9058 to God; he quite ceased to be able to endure things celestial. Thenceforward,
a creature9059 given to earth, and ejected from the sight of God, he begins to be easily turned
by impatience unto every use offensive to God. For straightway that impatience conceived
of the devil’s seed, produced, in the fecundity of malice, anger as her son; and when brought
forth, trained him in her own arts. For that very thing which had immersed Adam and Eve
in death, taught their son, too, to begin with murder. It would be idle for me to ascribe this
to impatience, if Cain, that first homicide and first fratricide, had borne with equanimity
and not impatiently the refusal by the Lord of his own oblations—if he is not wroth with
his own brother—if, finally, he took away no one’s life. Since, then, he could neither have
killed unless he had been wroth, nor have been wroth unless he had been impatient, he
demonstrates that what he did through wrath must be referred to that by which wrath was
suggested during this cradle-time of impatience, then (in a certain sense) in her infancy.
But how great presently were her augmentations! And no wonder, If she has been the first
delinquent, it is a consequence that, because she has been the first, therefore she is the only
parent stem,9060 too, to every delinquency, pouring down from her own fount various veins
of crimes.9061 Of murder we have spoken; but, being from the very beginning the outcome
of anger,9062 whatever causes besides it shortly found for itself it lays collectively on the ac-

count of impatience, as to its own origin. For whether from private enmities, or for the sake
of prey, any one perpetrates that wickedness,9063 the earlier step is his becoming impatient
of9064 either the hatred or the avarice. Whatever compels a man, it is not possible that
without impatience of itself it can be perfected in deed. Who ever committed adultery without
impatience of lust? Moreover, if in females the sale of their modesty is forced by the price,
of course it is by impatience of contemning gain9065 that this sale is regulated.9066 These (I
mention) as the principal delinquencies in the sight of the Lord,9067 for, to speak compendiously,
every sin is ascribable to impatience. “Evil” is “impatience of good.” None immodest
is not impatient of modesty; dishonest of honesty; impious of piety;9068 unquiet of quietness.
In order that each individual may become evil he will be unable to persevere9069 in being
good. How, therefore, can such a hydra of delinquencies fail to offend the Lord, the Disapprover
of evils? Is it not manifest that it was through impatience that Israel himself also always
failed in his duty toward God, from that time when,9070 forgetful of the heavenly arm
whereby he had been drawn out of his Egyptian affliction, he demands from Aaron “gods9071
as his guides;” when he pours down for an idol the contributions of his gold: for the so necessary
delays of Moses, while he met with God, he had borne with impatience. After the
edible rain of the manna, after the watery following9072 of the rock, they despair of the Lord
in not enduring a three-days’ thirst;9073 for this also is laid to their charge by the Lord as
impatience. And—not to rove through individual cases—there was no instance in which it
was not by failing in duty through impatience that they perished. How, moreover, did they
lay hands on the prophets, except through impatience of hearing them? on the Lord moreover
Himself, through impatience likewise of seeing Him? But had they entered the path of patience,
they would have been set free.9074</p>

<head>Chapter VI.—Patience Both Antecedent and Subsequent to Faith.</head>
<p>Accordingly it is patience which is both subsequent and antecedent to faith. In short,
Abraham believed God, and was accredited by Him with righteousness;9075 but it was patience
which proved his faith, when he was bidden to immolate his son, with a view to (I
would not say the temptation, but) the typical attestation of his faith. But God knew whom
He had accredited with righteousness.9076 So heavy a precept, the perfect execution whereof
was not even pleasing to the Lord, he patiently both heard, and (if God had willed) would
have fulfilled. Deservedly then was he “blessed,” because he was “faithful;” deservedly
“faithful,” because “patient.” So faith, illumined by patience, when it was becoming
propagated among the nations through “Abraham’s seed, which is Christ,”9077 and was
superinducing grace over the law,9078 made patience her pre-eminent coadjutrix for amplifying
and fulfilling the law, because that alone had been lacking unto the doctrine of righteousness.
For men were of old wont to require “eye for eye, and tooth for tooth”9079 and to
repay with usury “evil with evil;” for, as yet, patience was not on earth, because faith was
not either. Of course, meantime, impatience used to enjoy the opportunities which the law
gave. That was easy, while the Lord and Master of patience was absent. But after He has
supervened, and has united9080 the grace of faith with patience, now it is no longer lawful
to assail even with word, nor to say “fool”9081 even, without “danger of the judgment.”
Anger has been prohibited, our spirits retained, the petulance of the hand checked, the
poison of the tongue9082 extracted. The law has found more than it has lost, while Christ
says, “Love your personal enemies, and bless your cursers, and pray for your persecutors,
that ye may be sons of your heavenly Father.”9083 Do you see whom patience gains for us
as a Father? In this principal precept the universal discipline of patience is succinctly comprised,
since evil-doing is not conceded even when it is deserved.</p>

<head>Chapter VII.—The Causes of Impatience, and Their Correspondent Precepts.</head>
<p>Now, however, while we run through the causes of impatience, all the other precepts
also will answer in their own places. If our spirit is aroused by the loss of property, it is
commonished by the Lord’s Scriptures, in almost every place, to a contemning of the
world;9084 nor is there any more powerful exhortation to contempt of money submitted9085
(to us), than (the fact) the Lord Himself is found amid no riches. He always justifies the
poor, fore-condemns the rich. So He fore-ministered to patience “loss,” and to opulence
“contempt” (as portion);9086 demonstrating, by means of (His own) repudiation of riches,
that hurts done to them also are not to be much regarded. Of that, therefore, which we have
not the smallest need to seek after, because the Lord did not seek after it either, we ought
to endure without heart-sickness the cutting down or taking away. “Covetousness,” the
Spirit of the Lord has through the apostle pronounced “a root of all evils.”9087 Let us not
interpret that covetousness as consisting merely in the concupiscence of what is another’s:
for even what seems ours is another’s; for nothing is ours, since all things are God’s, whose
are we also ourselves. And so, if, when suffering from a loss, we feel impatiently, grieving
for what is lost from what is not our own, we shall be detected as bordering on covetousness:
we seek what is another’s when we ill brook losing what is another’s. He who is greatly stirred
with impatience of a loss, does, by giving things earthly the precedence over things heavenly,
sin directly9088 against God; for the Spirit, which he has received from the Lord, he greatly
shocks for the sake of a worldly matter. Willingly, therefore, let us lose things earthly, let us
keep things heavenly. Perish the whole world,9089 so I may make patience my gain! In truth,
I know not whether he who has not made up his mind to endure with constancy the loss of
somewhat of his, either by theft, or else by force, or else even by carelessness, would himself
readily or heartily lay hand on his own property in the cause of almsgiving: for who that
endures not at all to be cut by another, himself draws the sword on his own body? Patience
in losses is an exercise in bestowing and communicating. Who fears not to lose, finds it not
irksome to give. Else how will one, when he has two coats, give the one of them to the naked,
9090 unless he be a man likewise to offer to one who takes away his coat his cloak as

well?9091 How shall we fashion to us friends from mammon,9092 if we love it so much as
not to put up with its loss? We shall perish together with the lost mammon. Why do we
find here, where it is our business to lose?9093 To exhibit impatience at all losses is the
Gentiles’ business, who give money the precedence perhaps over their soul; for so they do,
when, in their cupidities of lucre, they encounter the gainful perils of commerce on the sea;
when, for money’s sake, even in the forum, there is nothing which damnation (itself) would
fear which they hesitate to essay; when they hire themselves for sport and the camp; when,
after the manner of wild beasts, they play the bandit along the highway. But us, according
to the diversity by which we are distinguished from them, it becomes to lay down not our
soul for money, but money for our soul, whether spontaneously in bestowing or patiently
in losing.</p>

<head>Chapter VIII.—Of Patience Under Personal Violence and Malediction.</head>
<p>We who carry about our very soul, our very body, exposed in this world9094 to injury
from all, and exhibit patience under that injury; shall we be hurt at the loss9095 of less important
things?9096 Far from a servant of Christ be such a defilement as that the patience
which has been prepared for greater temptations should forsake him in frivolous ones. If
one attempt to provoke you by manual violence, the monition of the Lord is at hand: “To
him,” He saith, “who smiteth thee on the face, turn the other cheek likewise.”9097 Let outrageousness9098
be wearied out by your patience. Whatever that blow may be, conjoined9099
with pain and contumely, it9100 shall receive a heavier one from the Lord. You wound that
outrageous9101 one more by enduring: for he will be beaten by Him for whose sake you
endure. If the tongue’s bitterness break out in malediction or reproach, look back at the
saying, “When they curse you, rejoice.”9102 The Lord Himself was “cursed” in the eye of
the law;9103 and yet is He the only Blessed One. Let us servants, therefore, follow our Lord
closely; and be cursed patiently, that we may be able to be blessed. If I hear with too little
equanimity some wanton or wicked word uttered against me, I must of necessity either
myself retaliate the bitterness, or else I shall be racked with mute impatience. When, then,
on being cursed, I smite (with my tongue,) how shall I be found to have followed the doctrine
of the Lord, in which it has been delivered that “a man is defiled,9104 not by the defilements
of vessels, but of the things which are sent forth out of his mouth.” Again, it is said that
“impeachment9105 awaits us for every vain and needless word.”9106 It follows that, from

whatever the Lord keeps us, the same He admonishes us to bear patiently from another. I
will add (somewhat) touching the pleasure of patience. For every injury, whether inflicted
by tongue or hand, when it has lighted upon patience, will be dismissed9107 with the same
fate as, some weapon launched against and blunted on a rock of most stedfast hardness. For
it will wholly fall then and there with bootless and fruitless labour; and sometimes will recoil
and spend its rage on him who sent it out, with retorted impetus. No doubt the reason why
any one hurts you is that you may be pained; because the hurter’s enjoyment consists in the
pain of the hurt. When, then, you have upset his enjoyment by not being pained, he must
needs he pained by the loss of his enjoyment. Then you not only go unhurt away, which
even alone is enough for you; but gratified, into the bargain, by your adversary’s disappointment,
and revenged by his pain. This is the utility and the pleasure of patience.</p>

<head>Chapter IX.—Of Patience Under Bereavement.</head>
<p>Not even that species of impatience under the loss of our dear ones is excused, where
some assertion of a right to grief acts the patron to it. For the consideration of the apostle’s
declaration must be set before us, who says, “Be not overwhelmed with sadness at the falling
asleep of any one, just as the nations are who are without hope.”9108 And justly; or, believing
the resurrection of Christ we believe also in our own, for whose sake He both died and rose
again. Since, then, there is certainty as to the resurrection of the dead, grief for death is
needless, and impatience of grief is needless. For why should you grieve, if you believe that
(your loved one) is not perished? Why should you bear impatiently the temporary withdrawal
of him who you believe will return? That which you think to be death is departure. He who
goes before us is not to be lamented, though by all means to be longed for.9109 That longing
also must be tempered with patience. For why should you bear without moderation the fact
that one is gone away whom you will presently follow? Besides, impatience in matters of
this kind bodes ill for our hope, and is a dealing insincerely with the faith. And we wound
Christ when we accept not with equanimity the summoning out of this world of any by
Him, as if they were to be pitied. “I desire,” says the apostle, “to be now received, and to be
with Christ.”9110 How far better a desire does he exhibit! If, then, we grieve impatiently over
such as have attained the desire of Christians, we show unwillingness ourselves to attain it.</p>

<head>Chapter X.—Of Revenge.</head>
<p>There is, too, another chief spur of impatience, the lust of revenge, dealing with the
business either of glory or else of malice. But “glory,” on the one hand, is everywhere
“vain;”9111 and malice, on the other, is always9112 odious to the Lord; in this case indeed
most of all, when, being provoked by a neighbour’s malice, it constitutes itself superior9113
in following out revenge, and by paying wickedness doubles that which has once been done.
Revenge, in the estimation of error,9114 seems a solace of pain; in the estimation of truth,
on the contrary, it is convicted of malignity. For what difference is there between provoker
and provoked, except that the former is detected as prior in evil-doing, but the latter as
posterior? Yet each stands impeached of hurting a man in the eye of the Lord, who both
prohibits and condemns every wickedness. In evil doing there is no account taken of order,
nor does place separate what similarity conjoins. And the precept is absolute, that evil is not
to be repaid with evil.9115 Like deed involves like merit. How shall we observe that principle,
if in our loathing9116 we shall not loathe revenge? What honour, moreover, shall we be offering
to the Lord God, if we arrogate to ourselves the arbitrament of vengeance? We are
corrupt9117—earthen vessels.9118 With our own servant-boys,9119 if they assume to themselves
the right of vengeance on their fellow-servants, we are gravely offended; while such
as make us the offering of their patience we not only approve as mindful of humility, of
servitude, affectionately jealous of the right of their lord’s honour; but we make them an
ampler satisfaction than they would have pre-exacted9120 for themselves. Is there any risk
of a different result in the case of a Lord so just in estimating, so potent in executing? Why,
then, do we believe Him a Judge, if not an Avenger too? This He promises that He will be
to us in return, saying, “Vengeance belongeth to me, and I will avenge;”9121 that is, Leave
patience to me, and I will reward patience. For when He says, “Judge not, lest ye be
judged,”9122 does He not require patience? For who will refrain from judging another, but

he who shall be patient in not revenging himself? Who judges in order to pardon? And if he
shall pardon, still he has taken care to indulge the impatience of a judger, and has taken
away the honour of the one Judge, that is, God. How many mischances had impatience of
this kind been wont to run into! How oft has it repented of its revenge! How oft has its
vehemence been found worse than the causes which led to it!—inasmuch as nothing undertaken
with impatience can be effected without impetuosity: nothing done with impetuosity
fails either to stumble, or else to fall altogether, or else to vanish headlong. Moreover, if you
avenge yourself too slightly, you will be mad; if too amply, you will have to bear the burden.
9123 What have I to do with vengeance, the measure of which, through impatience of
pain, I am unable to regulate? Whereas, if I shall repose on patience, I shall not feel pain; if
I shall not feel pain, I shall not desire to avenge myself.</p>

<head>Chapter XI.—Further Reasons for Practising Patience. Its Connection with the
Beatitudes.</head>
<p>After these principal material causes of impatience, registered to the best of our ability,
why should we wander out of our way among the rest,—what are found at home, what
abroad? Wide and diffusive is the Evil One’s operation, hurling manifold irritations of our
spirit, and sometimes trifling ones, sometimes very great. But the trifling ones you may
contemn from their very littleness; to the very great ones you may yield in regard of their
overpoweringness. Where the injury is less, there is no necessity for impatience; but where
the injury is greater, there more necessary is the remedy for the injury—patience. Let us
strive, therefore, to endure the inflictions of the Evil One, that the counter-zeal of our
equanimity may mock the zeal of the foe. If, however, we ourselves, either by imprudence
or else voluntarily, draw upon ourselves anything, let us meet with equal patience what we
have to blame ourselves for. Moreover, if we believe that some inflictions are sent on us by
the Lord, to whom should we more exhibit patience than to the Lord? Nay, He teaches9124
us to give thanks and rejoice, over and above, at being thought worthy of divine chastisement.
“Whom I love,” saith He, “I chasten.”9125 O blessed servant, on whose amendment the Lord
is intent! with whom He deigns to be wroth! whom He does not deceive by dissembling His
reproofs! On every side, therefore, we are bound to the duty of exercising patience, from
whatever quarter, either by our own errors or else by the snares of the Evil One, we incur
the Lord’s reproofs. Of that duty great is the reward—namely, happiness. For whom but
the patient has the Lord called happy, in saying, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is
the kingdom of the heavens?”9126 No one, assuredly, is “poor in spirit,” except he be humble.
Well, who is humble, except he be patient? For no one can abase himself without patience,
in the first instance, to bear the act of abasement. “Blessed,” saith He, “are the weepers and
mourners.”9127 Who, without patience, is tolerant of such unhappinesses? And so to such,
“consolation” and “laughter” are promised. “Blessed are the gentle:”9128 under this term,
surely, the impatient cannot possibly be classed. Again, when He marks “the peacemakers”
9129 with the same title of felicity, and names them “sons of God,” pray have the
impatient any affinity with “peace?” Even a fool may perceive that. When, however, He
says, “Rejoice and exult, as often as they shall curse and persecute you; for very great is your

them; no one will contemn them unless he have learnt to practise patience.</p>

<head>Chapter XII.—Certain Other Divine Precepts. The Apostolic Description of Charity.
Their Connection with Patience.</head>
<p>As regards the rule of peace, which9132 is so pleasing to God, who in the world that is
prone to impatience9133 will even once forgive his brother, I will not say “seven times,”
or9134 “seventy-seven times?”9135 Who that is contemplating a suit against his adversary
will compose the matter by agreement,9136 unless he first begin by lopping off chagrin,
hardheartedness, and bitterness, which are in fact the poisonous outgrowths of impatience?
How will you “remit, and remission shall be granted” you9137 if the absence of patience
makes you tenacious of a wrong? No one who is at variance with his brother in his mind,
will finish offering his “duteous gift at the altar,” unless he first, with intent to “reconciliate
his brother,” return to patience.9138 If “the sun go down over our wrath,” we are in jeopardy:
9139 we are not allowed to remain one day without patience. But, however, since Patience
takes the lead in9140 every species of salutary discipline, what wonder that she likewise
ministers to Repentance, (accustomed as Repentance is to come to the rescue of such as
have fallen,) when, on a disjunction of wedlock (for that cause, I mean, which makes it
lawful, whether for husband or wife, to persist in the perpetual observance of widowhood),
9141 she9142 waits for, she yearns for, she persuades by her entreaties, repentance in
all who are one day to enter salvation? How great a blessing she confers on each! The one
she prevents from becoming an adulterer; the other she amends. So, too, she is found in
those holy examples touching patience in the Lord’s parables. The shepherd’s patience seeks
and finds the straying ewe:9143 for Impatience would easily despise one ewe; but Patience

shoulders the forsaken sinner.9144 That prodigal son also the father’s patience receives, and
clothes, and feeds, and makes excuses for, in the presence of the angry brother’s impatience.
9145 He, therefore, who “had perished” is saved, because he entered on the way of
repentance. Repentance perishes not, because it finds Patience (to welcome it). For by whose
teachings but those of Patience is Charity9146—the highest sacrament of the faith, the
treasure-house of the Christian name, which the apostle commends with the whole strength
of the Holy Spirit—trained? “Charity,” he says, “is long suffering;” thus she applies patience:
“is beneficent;” Patience does no evil: “is not emulous;” that certainly is a peculiar mark of
patience: “savours not of violence:”9147 she has drawn her self-restraint from patience: “is
not puffed up; is not violent;”9148 for that pertains not unto patience: “nor does she seek
her own” if, she offers her own, provided she may benefit her neighbours: “nor is irritable;”
if she were, what would she have left to Impatience? Accordingly he says, “Charity endures
all things; tolerates all things;” of course because she is patient. Justly, then, “will she never
fail;”9149 for all other things will be cancelled, will have their consummation. “Tongues,
sciences, prophecies, become exhausted; faith, hope, charity, are permanent:” Faith, which
Christ’s patience introduced; hope, which man’s patience waits for; charity, which Patience
accompanies, with God as Master.</p>

<head>Chapter XIII.—Of Bodily Patience.</head>
<p>Thus far, finally, of patience simple and uniform, and as it exists merely in the mind:
though in many forms likewise I labour after it in body, for the purpose of “winning the
Lord;”9150 inasmuch as it is a quality which has been exhibited by the Lord Himself in
bodily virtue as well; if it is true that the ruling mind easily communicates the gifts9151 of
the Spirit with its bodily habitation. What, therefore, is the business of Patience in the body?
In the first place, it is the affliction9152 of the flesh—a victim9153 able to appease the Lord
by means of the sacrifice of humiliation—in making a libation to the Lord of sordid9154
raiment, together with scantiness of food, content with simple diet and the pure drink of
water9155 in conjoining fasts to all this; in inuring herself to sackcloth and ashes. This bodily
patience adds a grace to our prayers for good, a strength to our prayers against evil; this
opens the ears of Christ our God,9156 dissipates severity, elicits clemency. Thus that
Babylonish king,9157 after being exiled from human form in his seven years’ squalor and
neglect, because he had offended the Lord; by the bodily immolation of patience not only
recovered his kingdom, but—what is more to be desired by a man—made satisfaction to
God. Further, if we set down in order the higher and happier grades of bodily patience, (we
find that) it is she who is entrusted by holiness with the care of continence of the flesh: she
keeps the widow,9158 and sets on the virgin the seal9159 and raises the self-made eunuch to
the realms of heaven.9160 That which springs from a virtue of the mind is perfected in the
flesh; and, finally, by the patience of the flesh, does battle under persecution. If flight press

unto the final proof of happiness,9165 unto the occasion of the second baptism,9166 unto
the act of ascending the divine seat, no patience is more needed there than bodily patience.
If the “spirit is willing, but the flesh,” without patience, “weak,”9167 where, save in patience,
is the safety of the spirit, and of the flesh itself? But when the Lord says this about the flesh,
pronouncing it “weak,” He shows what need there is of strengthening, it—that is by patience—

<p>With this strength of patience, Esaias is cut asunder, and ceases not to speak concerning
the Lord; Stephen is stoned, and prays for pardon to his foes.9169 Oh, happy also he who
met all the violence of the devil by the exertion of every species of patience!9170—whom
neither the driving away of his cattle nor those riches of his in sheep, nor the sweeping away
of his children in one swoop of ruin, nor, finally, the agony of his own body in (one universal)
wound, estranged from the patience and the faith which he had plighted to the Lord; whom
the devil smote with all his might in vain. For by all his pains he was not drawn away from
his reverence for God; but he has been set up as an example and testimony to us, for the
thorough accomplishment of patience as well in spirit as in flesh, as well in mind as in body;
in order that we succumb neither to damages of our worldly goods, nor to losses of those
who are dearest, nor even to bodily afflictions. What a bier9171 for the devil did God erect
in the person of that hero! What a banner did He rear over the enemy of His glory, when,
at every bitter message, that man uttered nothing out of his mouth but thanks to God, while
he denounced his wife, now quite wearied with ills, and urging him to resort to crooked
remedies! How did God smile,9172 how was the evil one cut asunder,9173 while Job with
mighty equanimity kept scraping off9174 the unclean overflow of his own ulcer, while he
sportively replaced the vermin that brake out thence, in the same caves and feeding-places
of his pitted flesh! And so, when all the darts of temptations had blunted themselves against
the corslet and shield of his patience, that instrument9175 of God’s victory not only presently
recovered from God the soundness of his body, but possessed in redoubled measure what
he had lost. And if he had wished to have his children also restored, he might again have
been called father; but he preferred to have them restored him “in that day.”9176 Such joy
as that—secure so entirely concerning the Lord—he deferred; meantime he endured a voluntary

<head>Chapter XV.—General Summary of the Virtues and Effects of Patience.</head>
<p>So amply sufficient a Depositary of patience is God. If it be a wrong which you deposit
in His care, He is an Avenger; if a loss, He is a Restorer; if pain, He is a Healer; if death, He
is a Reviver. What honour is granted to Patience, to have God as her Debtor! And not without
reason: for she keeps all His decrees; she has to do with all His mandates. She fortifies faith;
is the pilot of peace; assists charity; establishes humility; waits long for repentance; sets her
seal on confession; rules the flesh; preserves the spirit; bridles the tongue; restrains the hand;
tramples temptations under foot; drives away scandals; gives their crowning grace to martyrdoms;
consoles the poor; teaches the rich moderation; overstrains not the weak; exhausts
not the strong; is the delight of the believer; invites the Gentile; commends the servant to
his lord, and his lord to God; adorns the woman; makes the man approved; is loved in
childhood, praised in youth, looked up to in age; is beauteous in either sex, in every time of
life. Come, now, see whether9177 we have a general idea of her mien and habit. Her countenance
is tranquil and peaceful; her brow serene9178 contracted by no wrinkle of sadness
or of anger; her eyebrows evenly relaxed in gladsome wise, with eyes downcast in humility,
not in unhappiness; her mouth sealed with the honourable mark of silence; her hue such as
theirs who are without care and without guilt; the motion of her head frequent against the
devil, and her laugh threatening;9179 her clothing, moreover, about her bosom white and
well fitted to her person, as being neither inflated nor disturbed. For Patience sits on the
throne of that calmest and gentlest Spirit, who is not found in the roll of the whirlwind, nor
in the leaden hue of the cloud, but is of soft serenity, open and simple, whom Elias saw at
his third essay.9180 For where God is, there too is His foster-child, namely Patience. When
God’s Spirit descends, then Patience accompanies Him indivisibly. If we do not give admission
to her together with the Spirit, will (He) always tarry with us? Nay, I know not whether
He would remain any longer. Without His companion and handmaid, He must of necessity
be straitened in every place and at every time. Whatever blow His enemy may inflict He will

<head>Chapter XVI.—The Patience of the Heathen Very Different from Christian Patience.</head>
<p>Theirs Doomed to Perdition. Ours Destined to Salvation.
This is the rule, this the discipline, these the works of patience which is heavenly and
true; that is, of Christian patience, not false and disgraceful, like as is that patience of the
nations of the earth. For in order that in this also the devil might rival the Lord, he has as it
were quite on a par (except that the very diversity of evil and good is exactly on a par with
their magnitude9181) taught his disciples also a patience of his own; that, I mean, which,
making husbands venal for dowry, and teaching them to trade in panderings, makes them
subject to the power of their wives; which, with feigned affection, undergoes every toil of
forced complaisance,9182 with a view to ensnaring the childless;9183 which makes the slaves
of the belly9184 submit to contumelious patronage, in the subjection of their liberty to their
gullet. Such pursuits of patience the Gentiles are acquainted with; and they eagerly seize a
name of so great goodness to apply it to foul practises: patient they live of rivals, and of the
rich, and of such as give them invitations; impatient of God alone. But let their own and
their leader’s patience look to itself—a patience which the subterraneous fire awaits! Let us,
on the other hand, love the patience of God, the patience of Christ; let us repay to Him the
patience which He has paid down for us! Let us offer to Him the patience of the spirit, the
patience of the flesh, believing as we do in the resurrection of flesh and spirit.</p>

<head>Elucidations.</head>

 <p>I.
(Unless patience sit by his side, cap. i. p. 707.)</p>
<p>Let me quote words which, many years ago, struck me forcibly, and which I trust, have
been blest to my soul; for which reason, I must be allowed, here, to thank their author, the
learned and fearless Dean Burgon, of Chichester. In his invaluable Commentary on the
Gospel, which while it abounds in the fruits of a varied erudition, aims only to be practically
useful, this pious scholar remarks: “To Faith must be added Patience, the ‘patient waiting
for God,’ if we would escape the snare which Satan spread, no less for the Holy One (i.e. in
the Temp. upon the Pinnacle) than for the Israelites at Massah. And this is perhaps the
reason of the remarkable prominence given to the grace of Patience, both by our Lord and
His Apostles; a circumstance, as it may be thought, which has not altogether attracted the
attention which it deserves.” He then cites examples;9185 but a reference to any good concordance
will strikingly exemplify the admirable comment of this “godly and well-learned
man.” See his comments on Matt. iv. 7 and Luke xxi. 19.</p>

 <p>II.
(Under their chin, cap. iv. p. 709.)</p>
<p>The reference in the note to Paris, as represented by Virgil and in ancient sculpture,
seems somewhat to the point:</p>
<p>“Et nunc ille Paris, cum semiviro comitatu.</p>
<p>Mæonia mentum mitra crinemq, madentem,</p>
<p>Subnixus, etc.”</p>
<p>He had just spoken of the pileus as a “Cap of freedom,” but there was another form of
pileus which was just the reverse and was probably tied by fimbriæ, under the chin, denoting
a low order of slaves, effeminate men, perhaps spadones. Now, the Phrygian bonnet to which
Virgil refers, is introduced by him to complete the reproach of his contemptuous expression
(semiviro comitatu) just before. So, our author—“not only from men, i.e. men so degraded
as to wear this badge of extreme servitude, but even from cattle, etc. Shall these mean
creatures outdo us in obedience and patience?”</p>

 <p>III.
(The world’s misusage, cap. xiii. p. 716.)</p>
<p>The Reverend Clergy who may read this note will forgive a brother, who begins to be
in respect of years, like “Paul the aged,” for remarking, that the reading of the Ante-Nicene
Fathers often leads him to sigh—“Such were they from whom we have received all that
makes life tolerable, but how intolerable it was for them: are we, indeed, such as they would
have considered Christians?” God be praised for His mercy and forbearance in our days;
but, still it is true that “we have need of patience.” Is not much of all that we regard as “the
world’s misusage,” the gracious hand of the Master upon us, giving us something for the
exercise of that Patience, by which He forms us into His own image? (Heb. xii. 3.) Impatience
of obscurity, of poverty, of ingratitude, of misrepresentation, of “the slings and arrows” of
slander and abuse, is a revolt against that indispensable discipline of the Gospel which requires
us to “endure afflictions” in some form or other. Who can complain when one thinks
what it would have cost us to be Christians in Tertullian’s time? The ambition of the Clergy
is always rebellion against God, and “patient waiting” is its only remedy. One will find
profitable reading on this subject in Massillon,9186 de l’Ambition des Clercs: “Reposez-vous
sur le Seigneur du soin de votre destinée: il saura bien accomplir, tout seul, les desseins qu’il
a sur vous. Si votre élévation est son bon plaisir, elle sera, aussi son ouvrage. Rendez-vous
en digne seulement par la retraite, par la frayeur, par la fuite, par les sentiments vifs de votre
indignité…c’est ainsi que les Chrysostome, les Grégoire, les Basil, les Augustin, furent
donnés à l’Église.”</p>

<head>You might also enjoy these classic Christian books from the CCEL:</head>
<head>ANF04. Fathers of the Third Century: Tertullian, Part Fourth;
Minucius Felix; Commodian; Origen, Parts First and Second by
Philip Schaff</head>
<p>Originally printed in 1885, the ten-volume set, Ante-Nicene Fathers, brings together the
work of early Christian thinkers. In particular, it brings together the writings of the early
Church fathers prior to the fourth century Nicene Creed. These volumes are noteworthy
for their inclusion of entire texts, and not simply fragments or excerpts from these great
writings. The translations are fairly literal, providing both readers and scholars with a good
approximation of the originals. This volume continues with the works of Tertullian, compiling
a series of his shorter treatises. It also contains the work of other Church Fathers from
"Latin Christianity"--Minucius Felix and Commododianus. Finally, it contains some of the
works of well-known and influential theologian Origen. These writings were heavily influential
on the early Church, and for good reason, as they are inspirational and encouraging.
These volumes also come with many useful notes, providing the reader with new levels of
understanding. Overall, Ante-Nicene Fathers, or any part of it, is a welcome addition to one's
reading list.</p>

<head>On Christian Doctrine, in Four Books by St. Augustine</head>
<p>In On Christian Doctrine, St. Augustine helps readers discover, teach, and defend the truths
of Scripture. According to St. Augustine, in order for Christians to fully understand Scripture,
it should be interpreted with faith, hope, and love. St. Augustine helps readers recognize
and interpret figurative expressions and ambiguous language. St. Augustine suggests that
readers consult original translations and commit difficult terms to memory. He also suggests
we familiarize ourselves with the meaning of frequently used symbols, such as "shepherd"
and "sheep." For those who teach the Scripture to others, St. Augustine says we must teach
in honesty--not for self-seeking purposes. This text offers an impressive wealth of practical
wisdom for reading the Bible. It is evident that St. Augustine earnestly wanted his readers
to understand God's Word.</p>

<head>NPNF2-08. Basil: Letters and Select Works</head>
<p>Author(s): Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers is a momentous achievement. Originally gathered
by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a
collection of writings by classical and medieval Christian
theologians.The purpose of such a collection is to make their
writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two
series, each with fourteen volumes. The second series focuses
on a variety of important Church Fathers, ranging from
the fourth century to the eighth century.This volume contains
selected works of St. Basil the Great. St. Basil is well-known
for his care for the poor and his important impact upon the
communal practices of the monastic life. The Nicene and
Post-Nicene Fathers are comprehensive in scope, and
provide keen translations of instructive and illuminating texts
from some of the great theologians of the Christian church.
These spiritually enlightening texts have aided Christians for
over a thousand years, and remain instructive and fruitful
even today!

<p>Preface. 138</p>
<p>Prefatory remarks on the need of exact investigation of the most minute portions
of theology.140</p>
<p>The origin of the heretics' close observation of syllables. 143</p>
<p>The systematic discussion of syllables is derived from heathen philosophy. 145</p>
<p>That there is no distinction in the scriptural use of these syllables. 147</p>
<p>That v: not found “of whom” in the case of the Son and of the Spirit. 149</p>
<p>Issue joined with those who assert that the Son is not with the Father, but after 
the Father. Also concerning the equal glory.155</p>
<p>Against those who assert that it is not proper for “with whom” to be said of the 
Son, and that the proper phrase is “through whom.”160</p>
<p>In how many ways “Through whom” is used; and in what sense “with whom” is
more suitable. Explanation of how the Son receives a commandment, and how
He is sent.162</p>
<p>Definitive conceptions about the Spirit which conform to the teaching of the
Scriptures.171</p>
<p>Against those who say that it is not right to rank the Holy Spirit with the Father
and the Son.174</p>
<p>That they who deny the Spirit are transgressors. 177</p>
<p>Against those who assert that the baptism in the name of the Father alone is
sufficient.178</p>
<p>Statement of the reason why in the writings of Paul the angels are associated with 
the Father and the Son.180</p>
<p>Objection that some were baptized unto Moses and believed in him, and an answer
to it; with remarks upon types.182</p>
<p>Reply to the suggested objection that we are baptized “into water.” Also concerning
baptism.186</p>
<p>That the Holy Spirit is in every conception inseparable from the Father and the
Son, alike in the creation of perceptible objects, in the dispensation of human
affairs, and in the judgment to come.190</p>

<pb n="iv"/>
<p>Against those who say that the Holy Ghost is not to be numbered with, but 
numbered under, the Father and the Son. Wherein moreover there is a summary
notice of the faith concerning right sub-numeration.196</p>
<p>In what manner in the confession of the three hypostases we preserve the pious 
dogma of the Monarchia. Wherein also is the refutation of them that allege that
the Spirit is subnumerated.199</p>
<p>Against those who assert that the Spirit ought not to be glorified. 205</p>
<p>Against those who maintain that the Spirit is in the rank neither of a servant nor
of a master, but in that of the free.209</p>
<p>Proof from Scripture that the Spirit is called Lord. 211</p>
<p>Establishment of the natural communion of the Spirit from His being, equally 
with the Father and the Son, unapproachable in thought.213</p>
<p>The glorifying of the enumeration of His attributes. 215</p>
<p>Proof of the absurdity of the refusal to glorify the Spirit, from the comparison of 
things glorified in creation.217</p>
<p>That Scripture uses the words “in” or “by,” ἐν, cf. note on p. 3, in place of “with.”
Wherein also it is proved that the word “and” has the same force as “with.”220</p>
<p>That the word “in,” in as many senses as it bears, is understood of the Spirit. 223</p>
<p>Of the origin of the word “with,” and what force it has. Also concerning the 
unwritten laws of the church.229</p>
<p>That our opponents refuse to concede in the case of the Spirit the terms which
Scripture uses in the case of men, as reigning together with Christ.236</p>
<p>Enumeration of the illustrious men in the Church who in their writings have used
the word “with.”239</p>

<head>Preface.</head>
<p>This translation of a portion of the works of St. Basil was originally begun under the
editorial supervision of Dr. Wace. It was first announced that the translation would comprise
the De Spiritu Sancto and Select Letters, but it was ultimately arranged with Dr. Wace that
a volume of the series should be devoted to St. Basil, containing, as well as the De Spiritu
Sancto, the whole of the Letters, and the Hexæmeron. The De Spiritu Sancto has already
appeared in an English form, as have portions of the Letters, but I am not aware of an English
translation of the Hexæmeron, or of all the Letters. The De Spiritu Sancto was presumably
selected for publication as being at once the most famous, as it is among the most valuable,
of the extant works of this Father. The Letters comprise short theological treatises and
contain passages of historical and varied biographical interest, as well as valuable specimens
of spiritual and consolatory exhortation. The Hexæmeron was added as being the most
noted and popular of St. Basil’s compositions in older days, and as illustrating his exegetic
method and skill, and his power as an extempore preacher.</p>
<p>The edition used has been that of the Benedictine editors as issued by Migne, with the
aid, in the case of the De Spiritu Sancto, of that published by Rev. C. F. H. Johnston.</p>
<p>The editorship of Dr. Wace terminated during the progress of the work, but I am indebted
to him, and very gratefully acknowledge the obligation, for valuable counsel and
suggestions. I also desire to record my thanks to the Rev. C. Hole, Lecturer in Ecclesiastical
History at King’s College, London, and to Mr. Reginald Geare, Head Master of the Grammar
School, Bishop’s Stortford, to the former for help in the revision of proof-sheets and important
suggestions, and to the latter for aid in the translation of several of the Letters.</p>
<p>The works consulted in the process of translation and attempted illustration are sufficiently
indicated in the notes.</p>

<p>Under the persecution of the second Maximinus,1 a Christian gentleman of good position
and fair estate in Pontus2 and Macrina his wife, suffered severe hardships.3 They escaped
with their lives, and appear to have retained, or recovered, some of their property.4 Of their
children the names of two only have survived: Gregory5 and Basil.6 The former became
bishop of one of the sees of Cappadocia. The latter acquired a high reputation in Pontus
and the neighboring districts as an advocate of eminence,7 and as a teacher of rhetoric. His
character in the Church for probity and piety stood very high.8 He married an orphaned
gentlewoman named Emmelia, whose father had suffered impoverishment and death for
Christ’s sake, and who was herself a conspicuous example of high-minded and gentle

Christian womanhood. Of this happy union were born ten children,9 five boys and five
girls. One of the boys appears to have died in infancy, for on the death of the elder Basil
four sons and five daughters were left to share the considerable wealth which he left behind
him.10 Of the nine survivors the eldest was a daughter, named, after her grandmother,
Macrina. The eldest of the sons was Basil, the second Naucratius, and the third Gregory.
Peter, the youngest of the whole family, was born shortly before his father’s death. Of this
remarkable group the eldest is commemorated as Saint Macrina in the biography written
by her brother Gregory. Naucratius died in early manhood,11 about the time of the ordination
of Basil as reader. The three remaining brothers occupied respectively the sees of
Cæsarea, Nyssa, and Sebasteia.</p>
<p>As to the date of St. Basil’s birth opinions have varied between 316 and 330. The later,
which is supported by Garnier, Tillemont, Maran,12 Fessler,13 and Böhringer, may probably
be accepted as approximately correct.14 It is true that Basil calls himself an old man in 374,15
but he was prematurely worn out with work and bad health, and to his friends wrote freely
and without concealment of his infirmities. There appears no reason to question the date
329 or 330.</p>
<p>Two cities, Cæsarea in Cappadocia and Neocæsarea in Pontus, have both been named
as his birthplace. There must be some amount of uncertainty on this point, from the fact
that no direct statement exists to clear it up, and that the word πατρίς was loosely employed
to mean not only place of birth, but place of residence and occupation.16 Basil’s parents
had property and interests both in Pontus and Cappadocia and were as likely to be in the

<note type="footnote">14 Gregory of Nazianzus, so called, was born during the episcopate of his father, Gregory, bishop of Nazianzus.
Gregory the elder died in 373, after holding the see forty-five years. The birth of Gregory the younger cannot
therefore be put before 328, and Basil was a little younger than his friend. (Greg. Naz., Ep. xxxiii.) But the birth
of Gregory in his father’s episcopate has naturally been contested. Vide D.C.B. ii. p. 748, and L. Montaut, Revue
Critique on Greg. of N. 1878.</note>
<note type="footnote">15 Ep. clxii.</note>
<note type="footnote">16 Gregory of Nazianzus calls Basil a Cappadocian in Ep. vi., and speaks of their both belonging to the same
πατρίς. In his Homily In Gordium martyrem, Basil mentions the adornment of Cæsarea as being his own adornment.
In Epp. lxxvi. and xcvi. he calls Cappadocia his πατρίς. In Ep. lxxiv., Cæsarea. In Ep. li. it is doubtful
whether it is Pontus, whence he writes, which is his πατρίς, or Cæsarea, of which he is writing. In Ep. lxxxvii.</note>

one as in the other. The early statement of Gregory of Nazianzus has been held to have
weight, inasmuch as he speaks of Basil as a Cappadocian like himself before there was any
other reason but that of birth for associating him with this province.17 Assenting, then, to
the considerations which have been held to afford reasonable ground for assigning Cæsarea
as the birthplace, we may adopt the popular estimation of Basil as one of “The Three Cappadocians,”
18 and congratulate Cappadocia on the Christian associations which have rescued
her fair fame from the slur of the epigram which described her as constituting with Crete
and Cilicia a trinity of unsatisfactoriness.19 Basil’s birth nearly synchronizes with the
transference of the chief seat of empire from Rome to Byzantium. He is born into a world
where the victory already achieved by the Church has been now for sixteen years officially
recognized.20 He is born into a Church in which the first great Council has already given
official expression to those cardinal doctrines of the faith, of which the final and formal
vindication is not to be assured till after the struggles of the next six score of years. Rome,
reduced, civilly, to the subordinate rank of a provincial city, is pausing before she realises
all her loss, and waits for the crowning outrage of the barbarian invasions, ere she begins
to make serious efforts to grasp ecclesiastically, something of her lost imperial prestige. For
a time the centre of ecclesiastical and theological interest is to be rather in the East than in
the West.</p>
<note type="footnote">it is apparently Pontus. Gregory of Nyssa (Orat. I. in xl. Mart.) calls Sebaste the πατρίς of his forefathers, possibly
because Sebaste had at one time been under the jurisdiction of Cappadocia. So in the N.T. πατρίς is the place
of the early life and education of our Lord.</note>

<head>II.—Education.</head>
<p>The place most closely connected with St. Basil’s early years is neither Cæsarea nor
Neocæsarea, but an insignificant village not far from the latter place, where he was brought
up by his admirable grandmother Macrina.21 In this neighbourhood his family had considerable
property, and here he afterwards resided. The estate was at Annesi on the river Iris
(Jekil-Irmak),22 and lay in the neighbourhood of scenery of romantic beauty. Basil’s own
description23 of his retreat on the opposite side of the Iris matches the reference of Gregory
of Nazianzus24 to the narrow glen among lofty mountains, which keep it always in shadow
and darkness, while far below the river foams and roars in its narrow precipitous bed.</p>
<p>There is some little difficulty in understanding the statement of Basil in Letter CCXVI.,
that the house of his brother Peter, which he visited in 375, and which we may assume to
have been on the family property (cf. Letter CX. § 1) was “not far from Neocæsarea.” As a
matter of fact, the Iris nowhere winds nearer to Neocæsarea than at a distance of about
twenty miles, and Turkhal is not at the nearest point. But it is all a question of degree. Relatively
to Cæsarea, Basil’s usual place of residence, Annesi is near Neocæsarea. An analogy
would be found in the statement of a writer usually residing in London, that if he came to
Sheffield he would be not far from Doncaster.25</p>
<note type="footnote">21 Epp. cciv., ccx., ccxxiii.</note>
<note type="footnote">22 Epp. iii., ccxxiii. The researches of Prof. W. M. Ramsay enable the exact spot to be identified with approximate
certainty, and, with his guidance, a pilgrim to the scenes of Basil’s boyhood and earlier monastic labours
might feel himself on fairly sure ground. He refers to the description of St. Basil’s hermitage given by Gregory
of Nazianzus in his Ep. iv., a description which may be compared with that of Basil himself in Ep. xiv., as one
which “can hardly refer to any other spot than the rocky glen below Turkhal. Ibora,” in which the diocese Annesi
was situated, “cannot be placed further down, because it is the frontier bishopric of Pontus towards Sebasteia,
and further up there is no rocky glen until the territory of Comana is reached. Gregory Nyssenus, in his treatise
on baptism” (Migne, iii. 324 c.) “speaks of Comana as a neighbouring city. Tillemont, thinking that the treatise
was written at Nyssa, infers that Nyssa and Comana were near each other. The truth is that Gregory must have
written his treatise at Annesi. We may therefore infer that the territory of Ibora adjoined that of Comana on
the east and that of Sebasteia on the south, and touched the Iris from the boundary of Comana down to the
point below Turkhal. The boundary was probably near Tokat, and Ibora itself may have been actually situated
near Turkhal.” Prof. W. M. Ramsay, Hist. Geog. of Asia Minor, p. 326.</note>

lived at a place further up the Iris than Dazimon, in the direction of Neocæsarea. But on more careful consideration
it is obvious that, after the troubles in Dazimon, Basil went to take a holiday with his brother Peter, and
therefore he did not necessarily continue his journey onward from Dazimon. The expression of neighbourhood</note>

<p>At Annesi his mother Emmelia erected a chapel in honour of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste
to which their relics were translated. It is possible that Basil was present at the dedication
services, lasting all night long, which are related to have sent his brother Gregory to sleep.26
Here, then, Basil was taught the rudiments of religion by his grandmother,27 and by his
father,28 in accordance with the teaching of the great Gregory the Wonder-worker.29 Here
he learned the Catholic faith.</p>
<p>At an early age he seems to have been sent to school at Cæsarea,30 and there to have
formed the acquaintance of an Eusebius, otherwise unknown,31 Hesychius,32 and Gregory
of Nazianzus,33 and to have conceived a boyish admiration for Dianius the archbishop.34</p>
<p>From Cæsarea Basil went to Constantinople, and there studied rhetoric and philosophy
with success. Socrates35 and Sozomen36 say that he worked at Antioch under Libanius. It
may be that both these writers have confounded Basil of Cæsarea with the Basil to whom
Chrysostom dedicated his De Sacerdotio, and who was perhaps the bishop of Raphanea,
who signed the creed of Constantinople.37</p>

<p>There is no corroboration of a sojourn of Basil of Cæsarea at Antioch. Libanius was at
Constantinople in 347,38 and there Basil may have attended his lectures.39</p>
<p>From Constantinople the young Cappadocian student proceeded in 351 to Athens. Of
an university town of the 4th century we have a lively picture in the writings of his friend,40
and are reminded that the rough horse-play of the modern undergraduate is a survival of a
very ancient barbarism. The lads were affiliated to certain fraternities,41 and looked out for
the arrival of every new student at the city, with the object of attaching him to the classes
of this or that teacher. Kinsmen were on the watch for kinsmen and acquaintances for acquaintances;
sometimes it was mere good-humoured violence which secured the person of
the freshman. The first step in this grotesque matriculation was an entertainment; then the
guest of the day was conducted with ceremonial procession through the agora to the entrance
of the baths. There they leaped round him with wild cries, and refused him admission. At
last an entry was forced with mock fury, and the neophyte was made free of the mysteries
of the baths and of the lecture halls. Gregory of Nazianzus, a student a little senior to Basil,
succeeded in sparing him the ordeal of this initiation, and his dignity and sweetness of
character seem to have secured him immunity from rough usage without loss of popularity.42
At Athens the two young Cappadocians were noted among their contemporaries for three
things: their diligence and success in work; their stainless and devout life; and their close
mutual affection. Everything was common to them. They were as one soul. What formed
the closest bond of union was their faith. God and their love of what is best made them
one.43 Himerius, a pagan, and Prohæresius, an Armenian Christian, are mentioned among
the well-known professors whose classes Basil attended.44 Among early friendships, formed
possibly during his university career, Basil’s own letters name those with Terentius45 and
Sophronius.46</p>

<p>If the Libanian correspondence be accepted as genuine, we may add Celsus, a pupil of
Libanius, to the group.47 But if we except Basil’s affection for Gregory of Nazianzus, of
none of these intimacies is the interest so great as of that which is recorded to have been
formed between Basil and the young prince Julian.48 One incident of the Athenian sojourn,
which led to bitter consequences in after days, was the brief communication with Apollinarius,
and the letter written “from layman to layman,”49 which his opponents made a handle
for much malevolence, and perhaps for forgery. Julian arrived at Athens after the middle
of the year 355.50 Basil’s departure thence and return to Cæsarea may therefore be approximately
fixed early in 356.51 Basil starts for his life’s work with the equipment of the most
liberal education which the age could supply. He has studied Greek literature, rhetoric, and
philosophy under the most famous teachers. He has been brought into contact with every
class of mind. His training has been no narrow hothouse forcing of theological opinion
and ecclesiastical sentiment. The world which he is to renounce, to confront, to influence
is not a world unknown to him.52 He has seen heathenism in all the autumn grace of its

Du moins, c’est vainement qu’on chercherait dans ses ouvrages quelque trace des poètes ou des prosateurs Latins.
Si des passages de l’Hexaméron semblent tirés de Cicéron ou de Pline, il ne faut pas s’y méprendre. C’étaint de
sortes de lieux cammuns qui se retrouvent dans Plutarque et dans Élien-ceux-ci les avaient empruntés à quelque
vieil auteur, Aristotle, par exemple, et c’est à cette source première qu’avaient puisé Grecs et Latins. Les Grecs
poussaient même si loin l’ignorance du ayant à dire comment le mot ciel s’exprime en Latin, l’écrit a peu pres
comme il devait l’entendre prononcer aux Romains, Κέλουμ, sans se préoccuper de la quantité ni de l’etymologie…La
littérature Grecque était donc le fonds unique des études en Orient, et certes elle pouvait, à elle seule, satisfaire de
nobles intelligences…C’est dans Homère que les jeunes Grecs apprenaient à lire. Pendant tout le cours de leurs
études, ils expliquaient ses poèmes…Ses vers remplissent la correspondances des pères de l’Eglise, et plus d’une
comparaison profane passe de ses poèmes dans leurs homélies. Après Homère, venaient Hésiode et les tragiques
Hérodote et Thucydide, Démosthène, Isocrate, et Lysias. Ainsi poètes, historiens, orateurs, formaient l’esprit, dirigeaient
le coeur, élevaient l’âme des enfants. Mais ces auteurs étaient les coryphées du paganisme, et plus d’une
passage de leur livres blessait la morale sévère du christianisme. Nul doute qu’un maitre religieux, un saint, comme
le père de Basile, á propos des dieux d’Homére,…dût plus d’une fois déplorer l’aveuglement d’un si beau
génie.…Jusqu’ici, les études de Basile repondent à peu près á notre instruction secondaire. Alors, comme aujourd’hui</note>

decline, and comes away victorious from seductions which were fatal to some young men
of early Christian associations. Athens no doubt contributed its share of influence to the
apostasy of Julian. Basil, happily, was found to be rooted more firmly in the faith.53</p>

<head>III.—Life at Cæsarea; Baptism; and Adoption of Monastic Life.</head>
<p>When Basil overcame the efforts of his companions to detain him at Athens, Gregory
was prevailed on to remain for a while longer. Basil therefore made his rapid journey
homeward alone. His Letter to Eustathius54 alleges as the chief reason for his hurried departure
the desire to profit by the instruction of that teacher. This may be the language of
compliment. In the same letter he speaks of his fortitude in resisting all temptation to stop
at the city on the Hellespont. This city I hesitate to recognise, with Maran, as Constantinople.
There may have been inducements to Basil to stop at Lampsacus and it is more probably
Lampsacus that he avoided.55 At Cæsarea he was welcomed as one of the most distinguished
of her sons,56 and there for a time taught rhetoric with conspicuous success.57 A deputation
came from Neocæsarea to request him to undertake educational work at that city,58 and in
vain endeavoured to detain59 him by lavish promises. According to his friend Gregory,
Basil had already determined to renounce the world, in the sense of devoting himself to an
ascetic and philosophic life.60 His brother Gregory, however,61 represents him as at this
period still under more mundane influences, and as shewing something of the self-confidence
and conceit which are occasionally to be observed in young men who have just successfully
completed an university career, and as being largely indebted to the persuasion and example
of his sister Macrina for the resolution, with which he now carried out the determination
to devote himself to a life of self-denial. To the same period may probably be referred Basil’s
baptism. The sacrament was administered by Dianius.62 It would be quite consonant with
the feelings of the times that pious parents like the elder Basil and Emmelia should shrink
from admitting their boy to holy baptism before his encountering the temptations of school

and university life.63 The assigned date, 357, may be reasonably accepted, and shortly after
his baptism he was ordained Reader.64 It was about this that he visited monastic settlements
in Palestine, Mesopotamia, Coele Syria, and Egypt,65 though he was not so fortunate as to
encounter the great pope Athanasius.66 Probably during this tour he began the friendship
with Eusebius of Samosata which lasted so long.</p>
<p>To the same period we may also refer his renunciation of his share of the family property.
67 Maran would appear to date this before the Syrian and Egyptian tour, a journey
which can hardly have been accomplished without considerable expense. But, in truth, with
every desire to do justice to the self-denial and unworldliness of St. Basil and of other likeminded
and like-lived champions of the Faith, it cannot but be observed that, at all events
in Basil’s case, the renunciation must be understood with some reasonable reservation. The
great archbishop has been claimed as a “socialist,” whatever may be meant in these days by
the term.68 But St. Basil did not renounce all property himself, and had a keen sense of its
rights in the case of his friends.69 From his letter on behalf of his foster-brother, placed by
Maran during his presbyterate,70 it would appear that this foster-brother, Dorotheus, was
allowed a life tenancy of a house and farm on the family estate, with a certain number of
slaves, on condition that Basil should be supported out of the profits. Here we have landlord,
tenant, rent, and unearned increment. St. Basil can scarcely be fairly cited as a practical
apostle of some of the chapters of the socialist evangel of the end of the nineteenth century.
But ancient eulogists of the great archbishop, anxious to represent him as a good monk,
<note type="footnote">63 According to the legendary life of St. Basil, attributed to St. Amphilochius, he was baptized at Jerusalem.
Nor is it right to omit to notice the argument of Wall (Infant Baptism, ch. x.) founded on a coincidence between
two passages in the writings of Greg. Naz. In Or. xl. ad init. he speaks of baptism as a γένεσις ἡμερινὴ καὶ
ἐλευθέρα καὶ λυτικὴ παθῶν, πᾶν τὸ ἀπὸ γενέσεως κάλυμμα περιτέμνουσα, καὶ πρὸς τὴν ἄνω ζωὴν ἐπανάγουσα.
In Or. xliii., he says of Basil that τὰ πρῶτα τῆς ἡλικίας ῦπὸ τῷ πατρὶ…σπαργανοῦται καὶ διαπλάττεται πλάσιν
τὴν ἀρίστην τε καὶ καθαρωτάτην, ἣν ἡμερινὴν ὁ θεῖος Δαβιδ καλῶς ὀνουάζει καὶ τῆς νυχτερινῆς ἀντίθετον.
As they stand alone, there is something to be said for the conclusion Wall deduces from these passages. Against
it there is the tradition of the later baptism, with the indication of Dianius as having performed the rite in the
De Sp. Scto. 29. On the other hand τὰ πρῶτα τῆς ἡλικιας might possibly refer not to infancy, but to boyhood.</note>

have not failed to foresee that this might be urged in objection to the completeness of his
renunciation of the world, in their sense, and to counterbalance it, have cited an anecdote
related by Cassian.71 One day a senator named Syncletius came to Basil to be admitted to
his monastery, with the statement that he had renounced his property, excepting only a
pittance to save him from manual labour. “You have spoilt a senator,” said Basil, “without
making a monk.” Basil’s own letter represents him as practically following the example of,
or setting an example to, Syncletius.</p>
<p>Stimulated to carry out his purpose of embracing the ascetic life by what he saw of the
monks and solitaries during his travels, Basil first of all thought of establishing a monastery
in the district of Tiberina.72 Here he would have been in the near neighbourhood of
Arianzus, the home of his friend Gregory. But the attractions of Tiberina were ultimately
postponed to those of Ibora, and Basil’s place of retreat was fixed in the glen not far from
the old home, and only separated from Annesi by the Iris, of which we have Basil’s own
picturesque description.73 Gregory declined to do more than pay a visit to Pontus, and so
is said to have caused Basil much disappointment.74 It is a little characteristic of the imperious
nature of the man of stronger will, that while he would not give up the society of his
own mother and sister in order to be near his friend, he complained of his friend’s not
making a similar sacrifice in order to be near him.75 Gregory76 good-humouredly replies
to Basil’s depreciation of Tiberina by a counter attack on Cæsarea and Annesi.</p>
<p>At the Pontic retreat Basil now began that system of hard ascetic discipline which
eventually contributed to the enfeeblement of his health and the shortening of his life. He
complains again and again in his letters of the deplorable physical condition to which he is
reduced, and he died at the age of fifty. It is a question whether a constitution better capable

of sustaining the fatigue of long journeys, and a life prolonged beyond the Council of Constantinople,
would or would not have left a larger mark upon the history of the Church.
There can be no doubt, that in Basil’s personal conflict with the decadent empire represented
by Valens, his own cause was strengthened by his obvious superiority to the hopes and fears
of vulgar ambitions. He ate no more than was actually necessary for daily sustenance, and
his fare was of the poorest. Even when he was archbishop, no flesh meat was dressed in his
kitchens.77 His wardrobe consisted of one under and one over garment. By night he wore
haircloth; not by day, lest he should seem ostentatious. He treated his body, says his
brother, with a possible reference to St. Paul,78 as an angry owner treats a runaway slave.79
A consistent celibate, he was yet almost morbidly conscious of his unchastity, mindful of
the Lord’s words as to the adultery of the impure thought.80 St. Basil relates in strong terms
his admiration for the ascetic character of Eustathius of Sebaste,81 and at this time was
closely associated with him. Indeed, Eustathius was probably the first to introduce the
monastic system into Pontus, his part in the work being comparatively ignored in later days
when his tergiversation had brought him into disrepute. Thus the credit of introducing
monasticism into Asia Minor was given to Basil alone.82 A novel feature of this monasticism
was the Coenobium,83 for hitherto ascetics had lived in absolute solitude, or in groups of
only two or three.84 Thus it was partly relieved from the discredit of selfish isolation and
unprofitable idleness.85</p>
<p>The example set by Basil and his companions spread. Companies of hard-working ascetics
of both sexes were established in every part of Pontus, every one of them an active
centre for the preaching of the Nicene doctrines, and their defence against Arian opposition
and misconstruction.86 Probably about this time, in conjunction with his friend Gregory,
Basil compiled the collection of the beauties of Origen which was entitled Philocalia. Origen’s
authority stood high, and both of the main divisions of Christian thought, the Nicene and
the Arian, endeavoured to support their respective views from his writings. Basil and Gregory

<head>IV.—Basil and the Councils, to the Accession of Valens.</head>
<p>Up to this time St. Basil is not seen to have publicly taken an active part in the personal
theological discussions of the age; but the ecclesiastical world was eagerly disputing while
he was working in Pontus. Aetius, the uncompromising Arian, was openly favoured by
Eudoxius of Germanicia, who had appropriated the see of Antioch in 357. This provoked
the Semiarians to hold their council at Ancyra in 358, when the Sirmian “Blasphemy” of
357 was condemned. The Acacians were alarmed, and manoeuvred for the division of the
general council which Constantius was desirous of summoning. Then came Ariminum,
Nike, and Seleucia, in 359, and “the world groaned to find itself Arian.” Deputations from
each of the great parties were sent to a council held under the personal presidency of Constantius
at Constantinople, and to one of these the young deacon was attached. The date
of the ordination to this grade is unknown. On the authority of Gregory of Nyssa88 and
Philostorgius,89 it appears that Basil accompanied his namesake of Ancyra and Eustathius
of Sebaste to the court, and supported Basil the bishop. Philostorgius would indeed represent
the younger Basil as championing the Semiarian cause, though with some cowardice.90 It
may be concluded, with Maran, that he probably stood forward stoutly for the truth, not
only at the capital itself, but also in the neighbouring cities of Chalcedon and Heraclea.91
But his official position was a humble one, and his part in the discussions and amid the intrigues
of the council was only too likely to be misrepresented by those with whom he did
not agree, and even misunderstood by his own friends. In 360 Dianius signed the creed of
Ariminum, brought to Cæsarea by George of Laodicea; and thereby Basil was so much distressed
as henceforward to shun communion with his bishop.92 He left Cæsarea and betook
himself to Nazianzus to seek consolation in the society of his friend. But his feelings towards
Dianius were always affectionate, and he indignantly repudiated a calumnious assertion
that he had gone so far as to anathematize him. Two years later Dianius fell sick unto death
and sent for Basil, protesting that at heart he had always been true to the Catholic creed.
Basil acceded to the appeal, and in 362 once again communicated with his bishop and old

friend.93 In the interval between the visit to Constantinople and this death-bed reconciliation,
that form of error arose which was long known by the name of Macedonianism, and which
St. Basil was in later years to combat with such signal success in the treatise Of the Spirit.
It combined disloyalty to the Spirit and to the Son. But countervailing events were the acceptance
of the Homoousion by the Council of Paris,94 and the publication of Athanasius’
letters to Serapion on the divinity of the two Persons assailed. To this period is referred the
compilation by Basil of the Moralia.95</p>
<p>The brief reign of Julian would affect Basil, in common with the whole Church, in two
ways: in the relief he would feel at the comparative toleration shewn to Catholics, and the
consequent return of orthodox bishops to their sees;96 in the distress with which he would
witness his old friend’s attempts to ridicule and undermine the Faith. Sorrow more personal
and immediate must have been caused by the harsh treatment of Cæsarea97 and the cruel
imposts laid on Cappadocia. What conduct on the part of the Cæsareans may have led
Gregory of Nazianzus98 to speak of Julian as justly offended, we can only conjecture. It may
have been the somewhat disorderly proceedings in connexion with the appointment of
Eusebius to succeed Dianius. But there can be no doubt about the sufferings of Cæsarea
nor of the martyrdom of Eupsychius and Damas for their part in the destruction of the
Temple of Fortune.99</p>

of Hadrian, the other the victim of Julian in 362, commemorated on Sept. 7. Tillemont identifies them. Baronius
thinks them distinct. J. S. Stilting (Act. Sanct. ed. 1868) is inclined to distinguish them mainly on the ground
that between 362 and the time of Basil’s describing the festival as an established yearly commemoration there
is not sufficient interval for the cultus to have arisen. This alone seems hardly convincing. The local interest
in the victim of Julian’s severity would naturally be great. Becket was murdered in 1170 and canonized in 1173,
Dec. 29 being fixed for his feast; Lewis VII. of France was among the pilgrims in 1179. Bernadette Soubirous
announced her vision at Lourdes in 1858; the church was begun there in 1862.</note>

<p>The precise part taken by Basil in the election of Eusebius can only be conjectured.
Eusebius, like Ambrose of Milan, a layman of rank and influence, was elevated per saltum
to the episcopate. Efforts were made by Julian and by some Christian objectors to get the
appointment annulled by means of Gregory, Bishop of Nazianzus, on the ground of its
having been brought about by violence. Bishop Gregory refused to take any retrogressive
steps, and thought the scandal of accepting the tumultuary appointment would be less than
that of cancelling the consecration. Gregory the younger presumably supported his father,
and he associates Basil with him as probable sufferers from the imperial vengeance.100 But
he was at Nazianzus at the time of the election, and Basil is more likely to have been an
active agent.101</p>
<p>To this period may be referred Basil’s receipt of the letter from Athanasius, mentioned
in Letter CCIV., § 6.102 On the accession of Jovian, in June, 363, Athanasius wrote to him
asserting the Nicene Faith, but he was greeted also by a Semiarian manifesto from Antioch,103
of which the first signatory was Meletius.</p>
<p>Valentinian and Valens, on their accession in the following year, thus found the Church
still divided on its cardinal doctrines, and the lists were marked in which Basil was henceforward
to be a more conspicuous combatant.</p>

<head>V.—The Presbyterate.</head>
<p>Not long after the accession of Valens, Basil was ordained presbyter by Eusebius.104
An earlier date has been suggested, but the year 364 is accepted as fitting in better with the
words of Gregory105 on the free speech conceded to heretics. And from the same Letter it
may be concluded that the ordination of Basil, like that of Gregory himself, was not wholly
voluntary, and that he was forced against his inclinations to accept duties when he hesitated
as to his liking and fitness for them. It was about this time that he wrote his Books against
Eunomius;106 and it may possibly have been this work which specially commended him to
Eusebius. However this may be, there is no doubt that he was soon actively engaged in the
practical work of the diocese, and made himself very useful to Eusebius. But Basil’s very
vigour and value seem to have been the cause of some alienation between him and his
bishop. His friend Gregory gives us no details, but it may be inferred from what he says
that he thought Basil ill-used.107 And allusions of Basil have been supposed to imply his
own sense of discourtesy and neglect.108 The position became serious. Bishops who had
objected to the tumultuary nomination of Eusebius, and had with difficulty been induced
to maintain the lawfulness of his consecration, were ready to consecrate Basil in his place.
But Basil shewed at once his wisdom and his magnanimity. A division of the orthodox
clergy of Cappadocia would be full of danger to the cause. He would accept no personal
advancement to the damage of the Church. He retired with his friend Gregory to his
<note type="footnote">104 It will have been noted that I have accepted the authority of Philostorgius that he was already deacon.
The argument employed by Tillemont against this statement is the fact of no distinct diaconate being mentioned
by Gregory of Nazianzus. But the silence of Gregory does not conclusively outweigh the distinct ἔτι τάξιν
διακόνου ἔχων of Philostorgius; and a diaconate is supported by the mistaken statement of Socrates (H.E. iv.
26) that the deacon’s orders were conferred by Meletius.</note>

Pontic monasteries,109 and won the battle by flying from the field. Eusebius was left unmolested,
and the character of Basil was higher than ever.110</p>
<p>The seclusion of Basil in Pontus seemed to afford an opportunity to his opponents in
Cappadocia, and according to Sozomen,111 Valens himself, in 365, was moved to threaten
Cæsarea with a visit by the thought that the Catholics of Cappadocia were now deprived of
the aid of their strongest champion. Eusebius would have invoked Gregory, and left Basil
alone. Gregory, however, refused to act without his friend, and, with much tact and good
feeling, succeeded in atoning the two offended parties.112 Eusebius at first resented Gregory’s
earnest advocacy of his absent friend, and was inclined to resent what seemed the somewhat
impertinent interference of a junior. But Gregory happily appealed to the archbishop’s
sense of justice and superiority to the common unwillingness of high dignitaries to accept
counsel, and assured him that in all that he had written on the subject he had meant to avoid
all possible offence, and to keep within the bounds of spiritual and philosophic discipline.113
Basil returned to the metropolitan city, ready to cooperate loyally with Eusebius, and to
employ all his eloquence and learning against the proposed Arian aggression. To the
grateful Catholics it seemed as though the mere knowledge that Basil was in Cæsarea was
enough to turn Valens with his bishops to flight,114 and the tidings, brought by a furious
rider, of the revolt of Procopius,115 seemed a comparatively insignificant motive for the
emperor’s departure.</p>
<p>There was now a lull in the storm. Basil, completely reconciled to Eusebius, began to
consolidate the archiepiscopal power which he afterward wielded as his own,116 over the

(Clouds, 94) of the house or school of Socrates, and apparently a comic parody on δικαστήριον. It
might be rendered “reflectory.” “Contemplatory” has been suggested. It is to be noted that Basil in the De Sp.
Scto. (see p. 49, n.) appears to allude to the Acharnians. The friends probably read Aristophanes together at
Athens.</note>

various provinces in which the metropolitan of Cæsarea exercised exarchic authority.117
In the meantime the Semiarians were beginning to share with the Catholics the hardships
inflicted by the imperial power. At Lampsacus in 364 they had condemned the results of
Ariminum and Constantinople, and had reasserted the Antiochene Dedication Creed of
341. In 366 they sent deputies to Liberius at Rome, who proved their orthodoxy by subscribing
the Nicene Creed. Basil had not been present at Lampsacus,118 but he had met Eustathius
and other bishops on their way thither, and had no doubt influenced the decisions of
the synod. Now the deputation to the West consisted of three of those bishops with whom
he was in communication, Eustathius of Sebasteia, Silvanus of Tarsus, and Theophilus of
Castabala. To the first it was an opportunity for regaining a position among the orthodox
prelates. It can hardly have been without the persuasion of Basil that the deputation went
so far as they did in accepting the homoousion, but it is a little singular, and indicative of
the comparatively slow awakening of the Church in general to the perils of the degradation
of the Holy Ghost, that no profession of faith was demanded from the Lampsacene delegates
on this subject.119 In 367 the council of Tyana accepted the restitution of the Semiarian
bishops, and so far peace had been promoted.120 To this period may very probably be referred
the compilation of the Liturgy which formed the basis of that which bears Basil’s
name.121 The claims of theology and of ecclesiastical administration in Basil’s time did not,
however, prevent him from devoting much of his vast energy to works of charity. Probably
the great hospital for the housing and relief of travellers and the poor, which he established
in the suburbs of Cæsarea, was planned, if not begun, in the latter years of his presbyterate,
for its size and importance were made pretexts for denouncing him to Elias, the governor
of Cappadocia, in 372,122 and at the same period Valens contributed to its endowment. It
was so extensive as to go by the name of Newtown,123 and was in later years known as the
“Basileiad.”124 It was the mother of other similar institutions in the country-districts of the

province, each under a Chorepiscopus.125 But whether the Ptochotrophium126 was or was
not actually begun before Basil’s episcopate, great demands were made on his sympathy
and energy by the great drought and consequent famine which befell Cæsarea in 368.127
He describes it with eloquence in his Homily On the Famine and Drought.128 The distress
was cruel and widespread. The distance of Cæsarea from the coast increased the difficulty
of supplying provisions. Speculators, scratching, as it were, in their country’s wounds,
hoarded grain in the hope of selling at famine prices. These Basil moved to open their
stores. He distributed lavishly at his own expense,129 and ministered in person to the wants
of the sufferers. Gregory of Nazianzus130 gives us a picture of his illustrious friend standing
in the midst of a great crowd of men and women and children, some scarcely able to breathe;
of servants bringing in piles of such food as is best suited to the weak state of the famishing
sufferers; of Basil with his own hands distributing nourishment, and with his own voice
cheering and encouraging the sufferers.</p>
<p>About this time Basil suffered a great loss in the death of his mother,131 and sought
solace in a visit to his friend Eusebius at Samosata.132 But the cheering effect of his journey
was lessened by the news, which greeted him on his return, that the Arians had succeeded
in placing one of their number in the see of Tarsus.133 The loss of Silvanus was ere long
followed by a death of yet graver moment to the Church. In the middle of 370 died Eusebius,
breathing his last in the arms of Basil.134</p>

and two miles from the site of the Græco-Roman city.”</note>

Maran (Vit. Bas. xi. § 4), with the object of proving that Basil had completely abandoned all property whatsoever,
says that this must refer to a legacy from his mother. The terms used are far more consistent with the view
already expressed (§ III.). So in his Orat. in Bas. Gregory speaks of Basil at the time as “selling his own possessions,
and buying provisions with the proceeds.”</note>

<head>VI.—Basil as Archbishop.</head>
<p>The archiepiscopal throne was now technically vacant. But the man who had practically
filled it, “the keeper and tamer of the lion,”135 was still alive in the plenitude of his power.
What course was he to follow ? Was he meekly to withdraw, and perhaps be compelled to
support the candidature of another and an inferior? The indirect evidence136 has seemed
to some strong enough to compel the conclusion that he determined, if possible, to secure
his election to the see.137 Others, on the contrary, have thought him incapable of scheming
for the nomination.138 The truth probably lies between the two extreme views. No intelligent
onlooker of the position at Cæsarea on the death of Eusebius, least of all the highly capable
administrator of the province, could be blind to the fact that of all possible competitors for
the vacant throne Basil himself was the ablest and most distinguished, and the likeliest to
be capable of directing the course of events in the interests of orthodoxy. But it does not
follow that Basil’s appeal to Gregory to come to him was a deliberate step to secure this end.
He craved for the support and counsel of his friend; but no one could have known better
that Gregory the younger was not the man to take prompt action or rule events. His invention
of a fatal sickness, or exaggeration of a slight one, failed to secure even Gregory’s presence
at Cæsarea. Gregory burst into tears on receipt of the news of his friend’s grave illness, and
hastened to obey the summons to his side. But on the road he fell in with bishops hurrying
to Cæsarea for the election of a successor to Eusebius, and detected the unreality of Basil’s
plea. He at once returned to Nazianzus and wrote the oft-quoted letter,139 on the interpretation
given to which depends the estimate formed of Basil’s action at the important crisis.</p>
<p>Basil may or may not have taken Gregory’s advice not to put himself forward. But
Gregory and his father, the bishop, from this time strained every nerve to secure the election

of Basil. It was felt that the cause of true religion was at stake. “The Holy Ghost must
win.”140 Opposition had to be encountered from bishops who were in open or secret sympathy
with Basil’s theological opponents, from men of wealth and position with whom Basil
was unpopular on account of his practice and preaching of stern self-denial, and from all
the lewd fellows of the baser sort in Cæsarea.141 Letters were written in the name of Gregory
the bishop with an eloquence and literary skill which have led them to be generally regarded
as the composition of Gregory the younger. To the people of Cæsarea Basil was represented
as a man of saintly life and of unique capacity to stem the surging tide of heresy.142 To the
bishops of the province who had asked him to come to Cæsarea without saying why, in the
hope perhaps that so strong a friend of Basil’s might be kept away from the election without
being afterwards able to contest it on the ground that he had had no summons to attend,
he expresses an earnest hope that their choice is not a factious and foregone conclusion,
and, anticipating possible objections on the score of Basil’s weak health, reminds them that
they have to elect not a gladiator, but a primate.143 To Eusebius of Samosata he sends the
letter included among those of Basil144 in which he urges him to cooperate in securing the
appointment of a worthy man. Despite his age and physical infirmity, he was laid in his
litter, as his son says145 like a corpse in a grave, and borne to Cæsarea to rise there with
fresh vigour and carry the election by his vote.146 All resistance was overborne, and Basil
was seated on the throne of the great exarchate.</p>
<p>The success of the Catholics roused, as was inevitable, various feelings. Athanasius
wrote from Alexandria147 to congratulate Cappadocia on her privilege in being ruled by so
illustrious a primate. Valens prepared to carry out the measures against the Catholic
province, which had been interrupted by the revolt of Procopius. The bishops of the province
who had been narrowly out-voted, and who had refused to take part in the consecration,
abandoned communion with the new primate.148 But even more distressing to the new
archbishop than the disaffection of his suffragans was the refusal of his friend Gregory to
come in person to support him on his throne. Gregory pleaded that it was better for Basil’s
own sake that there should be no suspicion of favour to personal friends, and begged to be

excused for staying at Nazianzus.149 Basil complained that his wishes and interests were
disregarded,150 and was hurt at Gregory’s refusing to accept high responsibilities, possibly
the coadjutor-bishopric, at Cæsarea.151 A yet further cause of sorrow and annoyance was
the blundering attempt of Gregory of Nyssa to effect a reconciliation between his uncle
Gregory, who was in sympathy with the disaffected bishops, and his brother. He even went
so far as to send more than one forged letter in their uncle’s name. The clumsy counterfeit
was naturally found out, and the widened breach not bridged without difficulty.152 The
episcopate thus began with troubles, both public and personal. Basil confidently confronted
them. His magnanimity and capacity secured the adhesion of his immediate neighbours
and subordinates,153 and soon his energies took a wider range. He directed the theological
campaign all over the East, and was ready alike to meet opponents in hand to hand encounter,
and to aim the arrows of his epistolary eloquence far and wide.154 He invokes the illustrious
pope of Alexandria to join him in winning the support of the West for the orthodox cause.155
He is keenly interested in the unfortunate controversy which distracted the Church of Antioch.
156 He makes an earnest appeal to Damasus for the wonted sympathy of the Church
at Rome.157 At the same time his industry in his see was indefatigable. He is keen to secure
the purity of ordination and the fitness of candidates.158 Crowds of working people come
to hear him preach before they go to their work for the day.159 He travels distances which
would be thought noticeable even in our modern days of idolatry of the great goddess Locomotion.
He manages vast institutions eleemosynary and collegiate. His correspondence is
constant and complicated. He seems the personification of the active, rather than of the
literary and scholarly, bishop. Yet all the while he is writing tracts and treatises which are
monuments of industrious composition, and indicative of a memory stored with various
learning, and of the daily and effective study of Holy Scripture.</p>

conscientious discharge of his high duties, he was not to escape an unjust charge of pusillan-

imity, if not of questionable orthodoxy, from men who might have known him better. On
September 7th, probably in 371,160 was held the festival of St. Eupsychius. Basil preached
the sermon. Among the hearers were many detractors.161 A few days after the festival there
was a dinner-party at Nazianzus, at which Gregory was present, with several persons of
distinction, friends of Basil. Of the party was a certain unnamed guest, of religious dress
and reputation, who claimed a character for philosophy, and said some very hard things
against Basil. He had heard the archbishop at the festival preach admirably on the Father
and the Son, but the Spirit, he alleged, Basil defamed.162 While Gregory boldly called the
Spirit God, Basil, from poor motives, refrained from any clear and distinct enunciation of
the divinity of the Third Person. The unfavourable view of Basil was the popular one at the
dinner-table, and Gregory was annoyed at not being able to convince the party that, while
his own utterances were of comparatively little importance, Basil had to weigh every word,
and to avoid, if possible, the banishment which was hanging over his head. It was better to
use a wise “economy”163 in preaching the truth than so to proclaim it as to ensure the extinction
of the light of true religion. Basil164 shewed some natural distress and astonishment
on hearing that attacks against him were readily received.165</p>

<note type="footnote">165 Mr. C.F.H. Johnston (The Book of St. Basil the Great on the Holy Spirit), in noting that St. Basil in the De
Sp. Scto. refrained from directly using the term Θεός of the Holy Ghost, remarks that he also avoided the use of
the term ὁμοούσιος of the Son, “in accordance with his own opinion expressed in Ep. ix.” In Ep. ix., however,
he rather gives his reasons for preferring the homoousion. The epitome of the essay of C. G. Wuilcknis (Leipsig,
1724) on the economy or reserve of St. Basil, appended by Mr. Johnston, is a valuable and interesting summary
of the best defence which can be made for such reticence. It is truly pointed out that the only possible motive
in Basil’s case was the desire of serving God, for no one could suspect or accuse him of ambition, fear, or covetousness.
And if there was an avoidance of a particular phrase, there was no paltering with doctrine. As Dr.
Swete (Doctrine of the H. S., p. 64) puts it: “He knew that the opponents of the Spirit’s Deity were watching their
opportunity. Had the actual name of God been used in reference to the Third Person of the Trinity, they would
have risen, and, on the plea of resisting blasphemy, expelled St. Basil from his see, which would then have been
immediately filled by a Macedonian prelate. In private conversation with Gregory, Basil not only asserted again
and again the Godhead of the Spirit, but even confirmed his statement with a solemn imprecation, ἐπαρασάμενος
ἑαυτῷ τὸ φρικωδέστατον, αὐτοῦ τοῦ πνεύματος ἐκπεσεῖν εἰ μὴ σέβοι τὸ πνεῦμα μετὰ πατρὸς καὶ ῾Υιοῦ ὡς
ὁμοούσιον καὶ ὁμότιμον.” (Greg. Naz., Or. xliii.) In Letter viii. § 11 he distinctly calls the Spirit God, as in Adv.
Eunomius, v., if the latter be genuine. In the De S. Scto. (p. 12) Basil uses the word οἰκονομία in the patristic
sense nearly equivalent to incarnation. In the passage of Bp. Lightfoot, referred to in the note on p. 7, he points</note>

<p>It was at the close of this same year 371166 that Basil and his diocese suffered most
severely from the hostility of the imperial government. Valens had never lost his antipathy
to Cappadocia. In 370 he determined on dividing it into two provinces. Podandus, a poor
little town at the foot of Mt. Taurus, was to be the chief seat of the new province, and
thither half the executive was to be transferred. Basil depicts in lively terms the dismay and
dejection of Cæsarea.167 He even thought of proceeding in person to the court to plead the
cause of his people, and his conduct is in itself a censure of those who would confine the
sympathies of ecclesiastics within rigidly clerical limits. The division was insisted on. But,
eventually, Tyana was substituted for Podandus as the new capital; and it has been conjectured168
that possibly the act of kindness of the prefect mentioned in Ep. LXXVIII. may
have been this transfer, due to the intervention of Basil and his influential friends.</p>
<p>But the imperial Arian was not content with this administrative mutilation. At the close
of the year 371, flushed with successes against the barbarians,169 fresh from the baptism of
Endoxius, and eager to impose his creed on his subjects, Valens was travelling leisurely towards
Syria. He is said to have shrunk from an encounter with the famous primate of
Cæsarea, for he feared lest one strong man’s firmness might lead others to resist.170 Before
him went Modestus, Prefect of the Prætorium, the minister of his severities,171 and before
Modestus, like the skirmishers in front of an advancing army, had come a troop of Arian
bishops with Euippius, in all probability, at their head.172 Modestus found on his arrival
that Basil was making a firm stand, and summoned the archbishop to his presence with the
hope of overawing him. He met with a dignity, if not with a pride, which was more than a
match for his own. Modestus claimed submission in the name of the emperor. Basil refused
it in the name of God. Modestus threatened impoverishment, exile, torture, death. Basil
retorted that none of these threats frightened him: he had nothing to be confiscated except
a few rags and a few books; banishment could not send him beyond the lands of God; torture

had no terrors for a body already dead; death could only come as a friend to hasten his last
journey home. Modestus exclaimed in amazement that he had never been so spoken to
before. “Perhaps,” replied Basil, “you never met a bishop before.” The prefect hastened to
his master and reported that ordinary means of intimidation appeared unlikely to move
this undaunted prelate. The archbishop must be owned victorious, or crushed by more
brutal violence. But Valens, like all weak natures, oscillated between compulsion and
compliance. He so far abated his pretensions to force heresy on Cappadocia, as to consent
to attend the services at the Church on the Festival of the Epiphany.173 The Church was
crowded. A mighty chant thundered over the sea of heads. At the end of the basilica, facing
the multitude, stood Basil, statue-like, erect as Samuel among the prophets at Naioth,174
and quite indifferent to the interruption of the imperial approach. The whole scene seemed
rather of heaven than of earth, and the orderly enthusiasm of the worship to be rather of
angels than of men. Valens half fainted, and staggered as he advanced to make his offering
at God’s Table. On the following day Basil admitted him within the curtain of the sanctuary,
and conversed with him at length on sacred subjects.175</p>
<p>The surroundings and the personal appearance of the interlocutors were significant.
The apse of the basilica was as a holy of holies secluded from the hum and turmoil of the
vast city.176 It was typical of what the Church was to the world. The health and strength
of the Church were personified in Basil. He was now in the ripe prime of life but bore marks
of premature age. Upright in carriage, of commanding stature, thin, with brown hair and
eyes, and long beard, slightly bald, with bent brow, high cheek bones, and smooth skin, he
would shew in every tone and gesture at once his high birth and breeding, the supreme
culture that comes of intercourse with the noblest of books and of men, and the dignity of
a mind made up and of a heart of single purpose. The sovereign presented a marked contrast
to the prelate.177 Valens was of swarthy complexion, and by those who approached him

<note type="footnote">177 The authority for the personal appearance of Basil is an anonymous Vatican document quoted by Baronius,
Ann. 378: “Procero fuit habitu corporis et recto, siccus, gracilis; color ejus fuscus, vultus temperatus pallore, justus

nearly it was seen that one eye was defective. He was strongly built, and of middle height,
but his person was obese, and his legs were crooked. He was hesitating and unready in
speech and action.178 It is on the occasion of this interview that Theodoret places the incident
of Basil’s humorous retort to Demosthenes,179 the chief of the imperial kitchen, the Nebuzaradan,
as the Gregories style him, of the petty fourth century Nebuchadnezzar. This Demosthenes
had already threatened the archbishop with the knife, and been bidden to go
back to his fire. Now he ventured to join in the imperial conversation, and made some
blunder in Greek. “An illiterate Demosthenes!” exclaimed Basil; “better leave theology
alone, and go back to your soups.” The emperor was amused at the discomfiture of his
satellite, and for a while seemed inclined to be friendly. He gave Basil lands, possibly part
of the neighbouring estate of Macellum, to endow his hospital.180</p>
<p>But the reconciliation between the sovereign and the primate was only on the surface.
Basil would not admit the Arians to communion, and Valens could not brook the refusal.
The decree of exile was to be enforced, though the pens had refused to form the letters of
the imperial signature.181 Valens, however, was in distress at the dangerous illness of Galates,
his infant son. and, on the very night of the threatened expatriation, summoned Basil to
pray over him. A brief rally was followed by relapse and death, which were afterwards
thought to have been caused by the young prince’s Arian baptism.182 Rudeness was from
time to time shewn to the archbishop by discourteous and unsympathetic magistrates, as
in the case of the Pontic Vicar, who tried to force an unwelcome marriage on a noble widow.
The lady took refuge at the altar, and appealed to Basil for protection. The magistrate descended
to contemptible insinuation, and subjected the archbishop to gross rudeness. His
ragged upper garment was dragged from his shoulder, and his emaciated frame was
threatened with torture. He remarked that to remove his liver would relieve him of a great
inconvenience.183</p>

<p>Nevertheless, so far as the civil power was concerned, Basil, after the famous visit of
Valens, was left at peace.184 He had triumphed. Was it a triumph for the nobler principles
of the Gospel? Had he exhibited a pride and an irritation unworthy of the Christian name?
Jerome, in a passage of doubtful genuineness and application, is reported to have regarded
his good qualities as marred by the one bane of pride,185 a “leaven” of which sin is admitted
by Milman186 to have been exhibited by Basil, as well as uncompromising firmness. The
temper of Basil in the encounter with Valens would probably have been somewhat differently
regarded had it not been for the reputation of a hard and overbearing spirit which he has
won from his part in transactions to be shortly touched on. His attitude before Valens seems
to have been dignified without personal haughtiness, and to have shewn sparks of that quiet
humour which is rarely exhibited in great emergencies except by men who are conscious
of right and careless of consequences to self.</p>

<head>VII.—The Breach with Gregory of Nazianzus.</head>
<p>Cappadocia, it has been seen, had been divided into two provinces, and of one of these
Tyana had been constituted the chief town. Anthimus, bishop of Tyana, now contended
that an ecclesiastical partition should follow the civil, and that Tyana should enjoy parallel
metropolitan privileges to those of Cæsarea. To this claim Basil determined to offer an
uncompromising resistance, and summoned Gregory of Nazianzus to his side. Gregory
replied in friendly and complimentary terms,187 and pointed out that Basil’s friendship for
Eustathius of Sebaste was a cause of suspicion in the Church. At the same time he placed
himself at the archbishop’s disposal. The friends started together with a train of slaves and
mules to collect the produce of the monastery of St. Orestes, in Cappadocia Secunda, which
was the property of the see of Cæsarea. Anthimus blocked the defiles with his retainers and
in the vicinity of Sasima188 there was an unseemly struggle between the domestics of the
two prelates.189 The friends proceeded to Nazianzus, and there, with imperious inconsiderateness,
Basil insisted upon nominating Gregory to one of the bishoprics which he was
founding in order to strengthen his position against Anthimus.190 For Gregory, the
brother, Nyssa was selected, a town on the Halys, about a hundred miles distant from
Cæsarea, so obscure that Eusebius of Samosata remonstrated with Basil on the unreasonableness
of forcing such a man to undertake the episcopate of such a place.191 For Gregory,
the friend, a similar fate was ordered. The spot chosen was Sasima, a townlet commanding
the scene of the recent fray.192 It was an insignificant place at the bifurcation of the road

Gregory (Orat. xliii. 58) represents Anthimus as defending his seizure of the metropolitan revenues on the ground

xviii. p. 60) has condemned Anthimus as an Arian. He was undoubtedly ΑρήU+0026 187·ος (Greg. Naz., Ep. xlviii.),
a devotee of Ares, as he shewed in the skirmish by Sasima; but there is no reason to suppose him to have been
Αρειανός, or Arian. He probably looked askance at the orthodoxy of Basil. Basil would never have called him

leading northwards from Tyana to Doara and diverging westward to Nazianzus.193 Gregory

its ecclesiastical dependence on Cæsarea, but politically it must have been subject to Tyana from 372 to 536,

contest with Anthimus and the civil power. His bishop of Nyssa, his own brother Gregory, was ejected by the
dominant Arians, but the eminence and vigour of Gregory secured his reinstatement and triumphant return.
Basil’s appointment was thus successful, and the connexion always continued. His appointment at Sasima was
unsuccessful. Gregory of Nazianzus would not maintain the contest, and Sasima passed under the metropolitan
of Tyana. At Doara, in like fashion, Basil’s nominee was expelled, and apparently never reinstated. Ep. ccxxxix.

place.195 Gregory resigned the distasteful post,196 and with very bitter feelings. The utmost
that can be said for Basil is that just possibly he was consulting for the interest of the Church,
and meaning to honour his friend, by placing Gregory in an outpost of peril and difficulty.
In the kingdom of heaven the place of trial is the place of trust.197 But, unfortunately for
the reputation of the archbishop, the war in this case was hardly the Holy War of truth
against error and of right against wrong. It was a rivalry between official and official, and
it seemed hard to sacrifice Gregory to a dispute between the claims of the metropolitans of
Tyana and Cæsarea.198</p>
<p>Gregory the elder joined in persuading his son. Basil had his way. He won a convenient
suffragan for the moment. But he lost his friend. The sore was never healed, and even in
the great funeral oration in which Basil’s virtues and abilities are extolled, Gregory traces
<note type="footnote">195 It is curious that a place which had so important a connexion with Gregory the divine should have passed
so completely into oblivion. From it he derived his episcopal rank. His consecration to Sasima was the main
ground of the objection of his opponents at Constantinople in 381 to his occupying the see of the imperial city.
He was bishop of Sasima, and, by the fifteenth Canon of Nicæa, could not be transferred to Constantinople.
He never was bishop of Nazianzus, though he did administer that diocese before the appointment of Eulalius
in 383. But while the name “Gregory of Nazianzus” has obscured the very existence of his father, who was really
Gregory of Nazianzus, and is known even to the typical schoolboy, Gregory has never been described as “Gregory
of Sasima.” “The great plain which extends from Sasima nearly to Soandos is full of underground houses and
churches, which are said to be of immense extent. The inhabitants are described by Leo Diaconus (p. 35) as
having been originally named Troglodytes.…Every house in Hassa Keni has an underground story cut out of
the rock; long narrow passages connect the underground rooms belonging to each house, and also run from
house to house. A big solid disc of stone stands in a niche outside each underground house door, ready to be
pulled in front of the door on any alarm.…Sasima was on the road between Nazianzus and Tyana. The distances
point certainly to Hassa Keni.…An absolutely unhistorical legend about St. Makrina is related at Hassa Keni.
Recently a good-sized church has been built in the village, evidently on the site of an ancient church; it is dedicated
to St. Makrina, who, as the village priest relates, fled hither from Kaisari to escape marriage, and to dedicate
herself to a saintly life. The underground cell in which she lived is below the church.” Ramsay, Hist. Geog. of
Asia Minor, pp. 293, 294. Paul Lucas identified Sasima with Inschesu.</note>

<note type="footnote">198 At the same time it is disappointing to find Gregory mixing up with expressions of reluctance to assume
awful responsibilities, objections on the score of the disagreeable position of Sasima. Perhaps something of the
sentiments of Basil on this occasion may be inferred from what he says in Letter cii. on the postponement of

the main trouble of his chequered career to Basil’s unkindness, and owns to feeling the smart
still, though the hand that inflicted the wound was cold.199</p>
<note type="footnote">199 Or. xliii. cf. Newman, The Church of the Fathers, p. 142, where the breach is impartially commented on:
“An ascetic, like Gregory, ought not to have complained of the country as deficient in beauty and interest, even
though he might be allowed to feel the responsibility of a situation which made him a neighbor of Anthimus.
Yet such was his infirmity; and he repelled the accusations of his mind against himself by charging Basil with
unkindness in placing him at Sasima. On the other hand, it is possible that Basil, in his eagerness for the settlement
of his exarchate, too little consulted the character and taste of Gregory; and, above all, the feelings of duty which
bound him to Nazianzus.…Henceforth no letters, which are preserved, passed between the two friends; nor are
any acts of intercourse discoverable in their history. Anthimus appointed a rival bishop to Sasima; and Gregory,
refusing to contest the see with him, returned to Nazianzus. Basil laboured by himself. Gregory retained his
feelings of Basil’s unkindness even after his death.…This lamentable occurrence took place eight or nine years
before Basil’s death; he had, before and after it, many trials, many sorrows; but this probably was the greatest
of all.” The statement that no letters which are preserved passed between the two friends henceforth will have
to be modified, if we suppose Letter clxix. to be addressed to Gregory the Divine. But Professor Ramsay’s arguments
(Hist. Geog. of Asia Minor, p. 293) in favour of Gregory of Nazianzus the elder seem irresistible. On Letter
clxix. he writes: “For topographical purposes it is necessary to discover who was the Gregory into whose diocese
Glycerius fled. Tillemont considers that either Gregory of Nyssa or Gregory of Nazianzus is meant. But the
tone of the letter is not what we might expect if Basil were writing to either of them. It is not conceived in the
spirit of authority in which Basil wrote to his brother or to his friend. It appears to me to show a certain deference
which, considering the resolute, imperious, and uncompromising character of Basil (seen especially in his behaviour
to Gregory Nazianzen in the matter of the bishopric of Sasima), I can explain only on the supposition that
he is writing to the aged and venerable Gregory, bishop of Nazianzos. Then the whole situation is clear. Venasa
was in the district of Malakopaia, or Suvermez, towards the limits of the diocese of Cæsareia. The adjoining
bishopric was that of Nazianzos. Venasa being so far from Cæsareia was administered by one of the fifty
chorepiscopi whom Basil had under him (Tillemont, Mem. p. servir, etc., ix. p. 120), and the authority of Basil
was appealed to only in the final resort. Glycerius, when Basil decided against him, naturally fled over the border
into the diocese of Nazianzos.” (There is, however, not much reverence in Letter clxxi.) “Comment l’homme
qui avait tant souffert de l’injustice des autres, put-il être injuste envers son meilleur ami? L’amitié est de tous les
pays. Partout, on voit des hommes qui semblent nés l’un pour l’autre, se rapprocher par une estime mutuelle, par
la conformité de leurs gouts et de leurs caractères partager les peines et les joies de la vie, et donner le spectacle du
plus beau sentiment que nous avons reçu de la divinité. Mais la Grèce avait singulièrement ennobli ce sentiment
dejà si pur et si saint, en lui donnant pour but l’amour de la patrie. Les amis, destines a se servir l’un à l’autre de
modèle et de soutien, s’aiment moins pour eux-mêmes, que pour rivaliser de vertu, se dévouer ensemble, s’immoler
s’il le faut, au bien public.…C’est cette amitié de dévouement et de sacrifice, qu’au milieu de la mollesse du IVme
siècle, Basil conçoit pour Grégoire de Nazianze. Formée dans les écoles, entretenne par l’amour des lettres, elle
avait pour but unique, non plus la patrie, mais Dieu. L’amitié de Grégoire et plus tendre et plus humaine.…Il a
voué sa vie à son ami, mais il en attend la même condescendance, le même denouement à ses propres désirs. Basile</note>

<p>With Anthimus peace was ultimately established. Basil vehemently desired it.200 Eusebius
of Samosata again intervened.201 Nazianzus remained for a time subject to Cæsarea,
but was eventually recognized as subject to the Metropolitan of Tyana.202</p>
<p>The relations, however, between the two metropolitans remained for some time strained.
When in Armenia in 372, Basil arranged some differences between the bishops of that district,
and dissipated a cloud of calumny hanging over Cyril, an Armenian bishop.203 He also
acceded to a request on the part of the Church of Satala that he would nominate a bishop
for that see, and accordingly appointed Poemenius, a relation of his own.204 Later on a
certain Faustus, on the strength of a recommendation from a pope with whom he was
residing, applied to Basil for consecration to the see, hitherto occupied by Cyril. With this
request Basil declined to comply, and required as a necessary preliminary the authorisation
of the Armenian bishops, specially of Theodotus of Nicopolis. Faustus then betook himself
to Anthimus, and succeeded in obtaining uncanonical consecration from him. This was
naturally a serious cause of disagreement.205 However, by 375, a better feeling seems to
have existed between the rivals. Basil is able at that date to speak of Anthimus as in complete
agreement with him.206</p>
<note type="footnote">au contraire, semble prendre à la lettre ce qu’il a lu dans Plutarque et dans Xénophon de l’amitié antique.” E.
Fialon, Et. Hist. In other words, Gregory’s idea of friendship was to sacrifice one’s self: Basil’s to sacrifice one’s
friend. This is an interesting vindication of Basil, but the cause of God was hardly identical with the humiliation
of Anthimus.</note>

<head>VIII.—St. Basil and Eustathius.</head>
<p>It was Basil’s doom to suffer through his friendships. If the fault lay with himself in the
case of Gregory, the same cannot be said of his rupture with Eustathius of Sebaste. If in this
connexion fault can be laid to his charge at all, it was the fault of entering into intimacy with
an unworthy man. In the earlier days of the retirement in Pontus the austerities of Eustathius
outweighed in Basil’s mind any suspicions of his unorthodoxy.207 Basil delighted in his
society, spent days and nights in sweet converse with him, and introduced him to his
mother and the happy family circle at Annesi.208 And no doubt under the ascendency of
Basil, Eustathius, always ready to be all things to all men who might be for the time in power
and authority, would appear as a very orthodox ascetic. Basil likens him to the Ethiopian
of immutable blackness, and the leopard who cannot change his spots.209 But in truth his
skin at various periods shewed every shade which could serve his purpose, and his spots
shifted and changed colour with every change in his surroundings.210 He is the patristic
Proteus. There must have been something singularly winning in his more than human attractiveness.
211 But he signed almost every creed that went about for signature in his lifetime.
212 He was consistent only in inconsistency. It was long ere Basil was driven to withdraw
his confidence and regard, although his constancy to Eustathius raised in not a few,
and notably in Theodotus of Nicopolis, the metropolitan of Armenia, doubts as to Basil’s
soundness in the faith. When Basil was in Armenia in 373, a creed was drawn up, in consultation
with Theodotus, to be offered to Eustathius for signature. It consisted of the Nicene
confession, with certain additions relating to the Macedonian controversy.213 Eustathius
signed, together with Fronto and Severus. But, when another meeting with other bishops
was arranged, he violated his pledge to attend. He wrote on the subject as though it were
one of only small importance.214 Eusebius endeavoured, but endeavoured in vain, to make
peace.215 Eustathius renounced communion with Basil, and at last, when an open attack
on the archbishop seemed the paying game, he published an old letter of Basil’s to Apollinarius,
written by “layman to layman,” many years before, and either introduced, or appended,

heretical expressions of Apollinarius, which were made to pass as Basil’s. In his virulent
hostility he was aided, if not instigated, by Demosthenes the prefect’s vicar, probably Basil’s
old opponent at Cæsarea in 372.216 His duplicity and slanders roused Basil’s indignant
denunciation.217 Unhappily they were not everywhere recognized as calumnies. Among
the bitterest of Basil’s trials was the failure to credit him with honour and orthodoxy on the
part of those from whom he might have expected sympathy and support. An earlier instance
of this is the feeling shewn at the banquet at Nazianzus already referred to.218 In later days
he was cruelly troubled by the unfriendliness of his old neighbours at Neocæsarea,219 and
this alienation would be the more distressing inasmuch as Atarbius, the bishop of that see,
appears to have been Basil’s kinsman.220 He was under the suspicion of Sabellian unsoundness.
He slighted and slandered Basil on several apparently trivial pretexts, and on one occasion
hastened from Nicopolis for fear of meeting him.221 He expressed objection to
supposed novelties introduced into the Church of Cæsarea, to the mode of psalmody practiced
there, and to the encouragement of ascetic life.222 Basil did his utmost to win back
the Neocæsareans from their heretical tendencies and to their old kindly sentiments towards
himself.</p>
<p>The clergy of Pisidia and Pontus, where Eustathius had been specially successful in alienating
the district of Dazimon, were personally visited and won back to communion.223
But Atarbius and the Neocæsareans were deaf to all appeal, and remained persistently irreconcilable.
224 On his visiting the old home at Annesi, where his youngest brother Petrus
was now residing, in 375, the Neocæsareans were thrown into a state of almost ludicrous
panic. They fled as from a pursuing enemy.225 They accused Basil of seeking to win their
regard and support from motives of the pettiest ambition, and twitted him with travelling
into their neighbourhood uninvited.226</p>

<head>IX.—Unbroken Friendships.</head>
<p>Brighter and happier intimacies were those formed with the older bishop of Samosata,
the Eusebius who, of all the many bearers of the name, most nearly realised its meaning,227
and with Basil’s junior, Amphilochius of Iconium. With the former, Basil’s relations were
those of an affectionate son and of an enthusiastic admirer. The many miles that stretched
between Cæsarea and Samosata did not prevent these personal as well as epistolary communications.
228 In 372 they were closely associated in the eager efforts of the orthodox bishops
of the East to win the sympathy and active support of the West.229 In 374 Eusebius was
exiled, with all the picturesque incidents so vividly described by Theodoret.230 He travelled
slowly from Samosata into Thrace, but does not seem to have met either Gregory or Basil
on his way. Basil contrived to continue a correspondence with him in his banishment. It
was more like that of young lovers than of elderly bishops.231 The friends deplore the
hindrances to conveyance, and are eager to assure one another that neither is guilty of forgetfulness.</p>
<p>The friendship with Amphilochius seems to have begun at the time when the young
advocate accepted the invitation conveyed in the name of Heracleidas,233 his friend, and
repaired from Ozizala to Cæsarea. The consequences were prompt and remarkable. Amphilochius,
at this time between thirty and forty years of age, was soon ordained and consecrated,
perhaps, like Ambrose of Milan and Eusebius of Cæsarea per saltum, to the important
see of Iconium, recently vacated by the death of Faustinus. Henceforward the intercourse
between the spiritual father and the spiritual son, both by letters and by visits, was constant.
The first visit of Amphilochius to Basil, as bishop, probably at Easter 374, not only gratified
the older prelate, but made a deep impression on the Church of Cæsarea.234 But his visits
were usually paid in September, at the time of the services in commemoration of the martyr
Eupsychius. On the occasion of the first of them, in 374, the friends conversed together on
the doctrine of the Holy Spirit, now impugned by the Macedonians, and the result was the
composition of the treatise De Spiritu Sancto. This was closely followed by the three famous

canonical epistles,235 also addressed to Amphilochius. Indeed, so great was the affectionate
confidence of the great administrator and theologian236 in his younger brother, that, when
infirmities were closing round him, he asked Amphilochius to aid him in the administration
of the archdiocese.237</p>
<p>If we accept the explanation given of Letter CLXIX. in a note on a previous page,238
Gregory the elder, bishop of Nazianzus, must be numbered among those of Basil’s correspondents
letters to whom have been preserved. The whole episode referred to in that and
in the two following letters is curiously illustrative of outbursts of fanaticism and folly which
might have been expected to occur in Cappadocia in the fourth century, as well as in
soberer regions in several other centuries when they have occurred. It has been clothed
with fresh interest by the very vivid narrative of Professor Ramsay, and by the skill with
which he uses the scanty morsels of evidence available to construct the theory which he
holds about it.239 This theory is that the correspondence indicates a determined attempt
on the part of the rigidly orthodox archbishop to crush proceedings which were really “only
keeping up the customary ceremonial of a great religious meeting,” and, as such, were winked
at, if not approved of, by the bishop to whom the letter of remonstrance is addressed, and
the presbyter who was Glycerius’ superior. Valuable information is furnished by Professor
Ramsay concerning the great annual festival in honour of Zeus of Venasa (or Venese), whose
shrine was richly endowed, and the inscription discovered on a Cappadocian hill-top, “Great
Zeus in heaven, be propitious to me.” But the “evident sympathy” of the bishop and the
presbyter is rather a strained inference from the extant letters; and the fact that in the days
when paganism prevailed in Cappadocia Venasa was a great religious centre, and the scene
of rites in which women played an important part, is no conclusive proof that wild dances
performed by an insubordinate deacon were tolerated, perhaps encouraged, because they
represented a popular old pagan observance. Glycerius may have played the patriarch,
without meaning to adopt, or travesty, the style of the former high priest of Zeus. Cappadocia
was one of the most Christian districts of the empire long before Basil was appointed to the
exarchate of Cæsarea, and Basil is not likely to have been the first occupant of the see who
would strongly disapprove of and endeavour to repress, any such manifestations as those
which are described.240 That the bishop whom Basil addresses and the presbyter served by

Glycerius should have desired to deal leniently with the offender individually does not
convict them of accepting the unseemly proceedings of Glycerius and his troupe as a pardonable,
if not desirable, survival of a picturesque national custom.241</p>
<p>Among other bishops of the period with whom Basil communicated by letter are Abramius,
or Abraham, of Batnæ in Oshoene,242 the illustrious Athanasius,243 and Ambrose,244
Athanasius of Ancyra;245 Barses of Edessa,246 who died in exile in Egypt; Elpidius,247 of
some unknown see on the Levantine seaboard, who supported Basil in the controversy with
Eustathius; the learned Epiphanius of Salamis;248 Meletius,249 the exiled bishop of Antioch;
<note type="footnote">241 In the chapter in which Professor Ramsay discusses the story of Glycerius he asks how it was that, while
Phrygia was heretical, Cappadocia, in the fourth century, was orthodox: “Can any reason be suggested why this
great Cappadocian leader followed the Roman Church, whereas all the most striking figures in Phrygian ecclesiastical
history opposed it?” In Phrygia was the great centre of Montanism, a form of religionism not unfavourable
to excesses such as those of Glycerius. But in Letter cciv., placed in 375, Basil claims both the Phrygias, i.e.
Pacatiana and Salutaris, as being in communion with him. By the “Roman Church,” followed by Cappadocia
and opposed by Phrygia, must be meant either the ecclesiastical system of the Roman Empire, or the Church at
Rome regarded as holding a kind of hegemony of Churches. If the former, it will be remembered that Cappadocia
boldly withstood the creed patronized and pressed by imperial authority, when the influence of Valens made
Arianism the official religion of Rome. If the latter, the phrase seems a misleading anachronism. In the fourth
century there was no following or opposing the Church of Rome as we understand the phrase. To the bishop
of Rome was conceded a certain personal precedence, as bishop of the capital, and he was beginning to claim
more. In the West there was the dignity of the only western apostolic see, and the Church of Rome, as a society,
was eminently orthodox and respectable. But, as important ecclesiastical centres, Antioch and Alexandria were
far ahead of Rome, and the pope of Alexandria occupied a greater place than the pope of Rome. What Basil was
eager to follow was not any local church, but the Faith which he understood to be the true and Catholic Faith,
i.e., the Faith of Nicæa. There was no church of Rome in the sense of one organized oecumenical society governed
by a central Italian authority. Basil has no idea of any such thing as a Roman supremacy. cf. Letter ccxiv. and

Patrophilus of Ægæ;250 Petrus of Alexandria;251 Theodotus of Nicopolis,252 and Ascholius
of Thessalonica.253</p>
<p>Basil’s correspondence was not, however, confined within the limits of clerical clanship.
His extant letters to laymen, both distinguished and undistinguished, shew that he was in
touch with the men of mark of his time and neighbourhood, and that he found time to express
an affectionate interest in the fortunes of his intimate friends.</p>
<p>Towards the later years of his life the archbishop’s days were darkened not only by illhealth
and anxiety, but by the death of some of his chief friends and allies. Athanasius died
in 373, and so far as personal living influence went, there was an extinction of the Pharos
not of Alexandria only, but of the world.254 It was no longer “Athanasius contra mundum,”
255 but “Mundus sine Athanasio.” In 374 Gregory the elder died at Nazianzus, and
the same year saw the banishment of Eusebius of Samosata to Thrace. In 375 died Theodotus
of Nicopolis, and the succession of Fronto was a cause of deep sorrow.</p>
<p>At this time256 some short solace would come to the Catholics in the East in the synodical
letter addressed to the Orientals of the important synod held in Illyria, under the authority
of Valentinian. The letter which is extant257 is directed against the Macedonian heresy.
The charge of conveying it to the East was given to the presbyter Elpidius.258 Valentinian
sent with it a letter to the bishops of Asia in which persecution is forbidden, and the excuse
of submission to the reigning sovereign anticipated and condemned. Although the letter
runs in the names of Valentinian, Valens, and Gratian, the western brother appears to
condemn the eastern.259</p>

<head>X.—Troubles of the Closing Years.</head>
<p>The relief to the Catholic East was brief. The paroxysm of passion which caused
Valentinian to break a blood-vessel and ended his life,260 ended also the force of the imperial
rescript. The Arians lifted their heads again. A council was held at Ancyra,261 in which
the homoousion was condemned, and frivolous and vexatious charges were brought against
Gregory of Nyssa.262 At Cyzicus a Semiarian synod blasphemed the Holy Spirit.263 Similar
proceedings characterized a synod of Antioch at about the same time.264 Gregory of Nyssa
having been prevented by illness from appearing before the synod of Ancyra, Eustathius
and Demosthenes persisted in their efforts to wound Basil through his brother, and
summoned a synod at Nyssa itself, where Gregory was condemned in his absence and deposed.
265 He was not long afterwards banished.266 On the other hand the Catholic bishops
were not inactive. Synods were held on their part, and at Iconium Amphilochius presided
over a gathering at which Basil was perhaps present himself, and where his treatise on the
Holy Spirit was read and approved.267 The Illyrian Council was a result incommensurate
with Basil’s passionate entreaties for the help of the westerns. From the midst of the troubles
which beset the Eastern Church Basil appealed,268 as he had appealed before,269 for the
sympathy and active aid of the other half of the empire. He was bitterly chagrined at the
failure of his entreaties for support, and began to suspect that the neglect he complained of
was due to coldness and to pride.270 It has seemed to some that this coldness in the West
was largely due to resentment at Basil’s non-recognition of the supremacy of the Roman
see.271 In truth the supremacy of the Roman see, as it has been understood in later times,

was hardly in the horizon.272 No bishop of Rome had even been present at Nicæa, or at
Sardica, where a certain right of appeal to his see was conceded. A bishop of Rome signed
the Sirmian blasphemy. No bishop of Rome was present to save ‘the world’ from the lapse
of Ariminum. Julian “might seem to have forgotten that there was such a city as Rome.”273
The great intellectual Arian war was fought out without any claim of Rome to speak. Half
a century after Basil’s death great orientals were quite unconscious of this supremacy.274
At Chalcedon the measure of the growing claim is aptly typified by the wish of Paschasinus
of Lilybæum, one of the representatives of Leo, to be regarded as presiding, though he did
not preside. The supremacy is hardly in view even at the last of the four great Councils.</p>
<p>In fact the appeal of Basil seems to have failed to elicit the response he desired, not so
much from the independent tone of his letters, which was only in accordance with the recognised
facts of the age,275 as from occidental suspicions of Basil’s orthodoxy,276 and from
the failure of men, who thought and wrote in Latin, to enter fully into the controversies
conducted in a more subtle tongue.277 Basil had taken every precaution to ensure the conveyance
of his letters by messengers of tact and discretion. He had deprecated the advocacy
of so simple-minded and undiplomatic an ambassador as his brother Gregory.278 He had
poured out his very soul in entreaty.279 But all was unavailing. He suffered, and he had to
suffer unsupported by a human sympathy on which he thought he had a just claim.280</p>

<pb n="49"/>
<p>It is of a piece with Basil’s habitual silence on the general affairs of the empire that he
should seem to be insensible of the shock caused by the approach of the Goths in 378. A
letter to Eusebius in exile in Thrace does shew at least a consciousness of a disturbed state
of the country, and he is afraid of exposing his courier to needless danger by entrusting him
with a present for his friend. But this is all.281 He may have written letters shewing an interest
in the fortunes of the empire which have not been preserved. But his whole soul was
absorbed in the cause of Catholic truth, and in the fate of the Church. His youth had been
steeped in culture, but the work of his ripe manhood left no time for the literary amusement
of the dilettante. So it may be that the intense earnestness with which he said to himself,
“This one thing I do,” of his work as a shepherd of souls, and a fighter for the truth, and his
knowledge that for the doing of this work his time was short, accounts for the absence from
his correspondence of many a topic of more than contemporary interest. At all events, it
is not difficult to descry that the turn in the stream of civil history was of vital moment to
the cause which Basil held dear. The approach of the enemy was fraught with important
consequences to the Church. The imperial attention was diverted from persecution of the
Catholics to defence of the realm. Then came the disaster of Adrianople,282 and the terrible
end of the unfortunate Valens.283 Gratian, a sensible lad, of Catholic sympathies, restored
the exiled bishops, and Basil, in the few months of life yet left him, may have once more
embraced his faithful friend Eusebius. The end drew rapidly near. Basil was only fifty, but
he was an old man. Work, sickness, and trouble had worn him out. His health had never
been good. A chronic liver complaint was a constant cause of distress and depression.</p>
<p>In 373 he had been at death’s door. Indeed, the news of his death was actually circulated,
and bishops arrived at Cæsarea with the probable object of arranging the succession.284
He had submitted to the treatment of a course of natural hot baths, but with small beneficial
result.285 By 376, as he playfully reminds Amphilochius, he had lost all his teeth.286 At last
the powerful mind and the fiery enthusiasm of duty were no longer able to stimulate the
energies of the feeble frame.</p>

dangerous. It may be unfair to charge Basil with indifference to great events, because we do not possess his letters
about them.</note>

<p>The winter of 378–9 dealt the last blow, and with the first day of what, to us, is now the
new year, the great spirit fled. Gregory, alas! was not at the bedside. But he has left us a
narrative which bears the stamp of truth. For some time the bystanders thought that the
dying bishop had ceased to breathe. Then the old strength blazed out at the last. He spoke
with vigour, and even ordained some of the faithful who were with him. Then he lay once
more feeble and evidently passing away. Crowds surrounded his residence, praying eagerly
for his restoration to them, and willing to give their lives for his. With a few final words of
advice and exhortation, he said: “Into thy hands I commend my spirit,” and so ended.</p>
<p>The funeral was a scene of intense excitement and rapturous reverence. Crowds filled
every open space, and every gallery and window; Jews and Pagans joined with Christians
in lamentation, and the cries and groans of the agitated oriental multitude drowned the
music of the hymns which were sung. The press was so great that several fatal accidents
added to the universal gloom. Basil was buried in the “sepulchre of his fathers”—a phrase
which may possibly mean in the ancestral tomb of his family at Cæsarea.</p>
<p>So passed away a leader of men in whose case the epithet ‘great’ is no conventional
compliment. He shared with his illustrious brother primate of Alexandria the honour of
rallying the Catholic forces in the darkest days of the Arian depression. He was great as
foremost champion of a great cause, great in contemporary and posthumous influence,
great in industry and self-denial, great as a literary controversialist. The estimate formed
of him by his contemporaries is expressed in the generous, if somewhat turgid, eloquence
of the laudatory oration of the slighted Gregory of Nazianzus. Yet nothing in Gregory’s
eulogy goes beyond the expressions of the prelate who has seemed to some to be “the wisest
and holiest man in the East in the succeeding century.”287 Basil is described by the saintly
and learned Theodoret288 in terms that might seem exaggerated when applied to any but
his master, as the light not of Cappadocia only, but of the world.289 To Sophronius290 he
is the “glory of the Church.” To Isidore of Pelusium,291 he seems to speak as one inspired.
To the Council of Chalcedon he is emphatically a minister of grace;292 to the second council
of Nicæa a layer of the foundations of orthodoxy.293 His death lacks the splendid triumph
of the martyrdoms of Polycarp and Cyprian. His life lacks the vivid incidents which make
the adventures of Athanasius an enthralling romance. He does not attract the sympathy

evoked by the unsophisticated simplicity of Gregory his friend or of Gregory his brother.
There does not linger about his memory the close personal interest that binds humanity to
Augustine, or the winning loyalty and tenderness that charm far off centuries into affection
for Theodoret. Sometimes he seems a hard, almost a sour man.294 Sometimes there is a
jarring reminder of his jealousy for his own dignity.295 Evidently he was not a man who
could be thwarted without a rupture of pleasant relations, or slighted with impunity. In
any subordinate position he was not easy to get on with.296 But a man of strong will, convicted
that he is championing a righteous cause, will not hesitate to sacrifice, among other
things, the amenities that come of amiable absence of self-assertion. To Basil, to assert
himself was to assert the truth of Christ and of His Church. And in the main the identification
was a true one. Basil was human, and occasionally, as in the famous dispute with
Anthimus, so disastrously fatal to the typical friendship of the earlier manhood, he may
have failed to perceive that the Catholic cause would not suffer from the existence of two
metropolitans in Cappadocia. But the great archbishop could be an affectionate friend,
thirsty for sympathy.297 And he was right in his estimate of his position. Broadly speaking,
Basil, more powerfully than any contemporary official, worker, or writer in the Church, did
represent and defend through all the populous provinces of the empire which stretched
from the Balkans to the Mediterranean, from the Ægean to the Euphrates, the cause whose
failure or success has been discerned, even by thinkers of no favourable predisposition, to
have meant death or life to the Church.298 St. Basil is duly canonized in the grateful memory,
no less than in the official bead-roll, of Christendom, and we may be permitted to regret
that the existing Kalendar of the Anglican liturgy has not found room for so illustrious a
Doctor in its somewhat niggard list.299 For the omission some amends have lately300 been

burial at Cæsarea and the earliest record of their supposed reappearance is wide. There was a Church of St.
Basil at Bruges founded in 1187, which was believed to possess some of the archbishop’s bones. These were
solemnly translated in 1463 to the Church of St. Donatian, which disappeared at the time of the French revolution.

<p>I. (i) Against Eunomius. The work under this title comprises five books, the first three
generally accepted as genuine, the last two sometimes regarded as doubtful. Gregory of
Nazianzus,303 Jerome,304 and Theodoret305 all testify to Basil’s having written against Eunomius,
but do not specify the number of books. Books IV. and V. are accepted by Bellarmine,
Du Pin, Tillemont, and Ceillier, mainly on the authority of the edict of Justinian against the
Three Chapters (Mansi ix., 552), the Council of Seville (Mansi x., 566) and the Council of
Florence (Hardouin ix., 200). Maran (Vit. Bas. xliii.) speaks rather doubtfully. Böhringer
describes them as of suspicious character, alike on grounds of style, and of their absence
from some mss. They may possibly be notes on the controversy in general, and not immediately
directed against Eunomius. Fessler’s conclusion is “Major tamen eruditorum pars
eos etiam genuinos esse censet.”</p>
<p>The year 364 is assigned for the date of the publication of the three books.306 At that
time Basil sent them with a few words of half ironical depreciation to Leontius the sophist.307
He was now about thirty-four years of age, and describes himself as hitherto inexperienced
in such a kind of composition.308 Eunomius, like his illustrious opponent, was a Cappadocian.
Emulous of the notoriety achieved by Aetius the Anomoean, and urged on by Secundus
of Ptolemais, an intimate associate of Aetius, he went to Alexandria about 356 and resided
there for two years as Aetius’ admiring pupil and secretary. In 358 he accompanied Aetius
to Antioch, and took a prominent part in the assertion of the extreme doctrines which revolted
the more moderate Semiarians. He was selected as the champion of the advanced
blasphemers, made himself consequently obnoxious to Constantius, and was apprehended
and relegated to Migde in Phrygia. At the same time Eudoxius withdrew for a while into
Armenia, his native province, but ere long was restored to the favour of the fickle Constantius,
and was appointed to the see of Constantinople in 359. Eunomius now was for overthrowing
Aetius, and removing whatever obstacles stood between him and promotion, and,
by the influence of Eudoxius, was nominated to the see of Cyzicus, vacant by the deposition
of Eleusius. Here for a while he temporized, but ere long displayed his true sentiments. To
answer for this he was summoned to Constantinople by Constantius, and, in his absence,
condemned and deposed. Now he became more marked than ever in his assertion of the
most extreme Arianism, and the advanced party were henceforward known under his name.

The accession of Julian brought him back with the rest of the banished bishops, and he made
Constantinople the centre for the dissemination of his views.309</p>
<p>Somewhere about this period he wrote the work entitled Apologeticus, in twenty-eight
chapters, to which Basil replies. The title was at once a parody on the Apologies of defenders
of the Faith, and, at the same time, a suggestion that his utterances were not spontaneous,
but forced from him by attack. The work is printed in Fabricius, Bibl. Græc. viii. 262, and
in the appendix to Migne’s Basil. Pat. Gr. xxx. 837.310 It is a brief treatise, and occupies
only about fifteen columns of Migne’s edition. It professes to be a defence of the “simpler
creed which is common to all Christians.”311</p>
<p>This creed is as follows: “We believe in one God, Father Almighty, of Whom are all
things: and in one only-begotten Son of God, God the Word, our Lord Jesus Christ, through
Whom are all things: and in one Holy Spirit, the Comforter.”312 But it is in reality like the
extant Exposition of the Creed,313 a reading into this “simpler” creed, in itself orthodox and
unobjectionable, of explanations which ran distinctly counter to the traditional and instinctive
faith of the Church, and inevitably demanded corrective explanations and definitions.</p>
<p>In the creed of Eunomius the Son is God, and it is not in terms denied that He is of one
substance with the Father. But in his doctrinal system there is a practical denial of the Creed;

the Son may be styled God, but He is a creature, and therefore, in the strict sense of the
term, not God at all, and, at best, a hero or demigod. The Father, unbegotten, stood alone
and supreme; the very idea of “begotten” implied posteriority, inferiority, and unlikeness.
Against this position Basil314 protests. The arguments of Eunomius, he urges, are tantamount
to an adoption of what was probably an Arian formula, “We believe that ingenerateness is
the essence of God,”315 i.e., we believe that the Only-begotten is essentially unlike the
Father.316 This word “unbegotten,” of which Eunomius and his supporters make so much,
what is its real value? Basil admits that it is apparently a convenient term for human intelligence
to use; but, he urges, “It is nowhere to be found in Scripture; it is one of the main
elements in the Arian blasphemy; it had better be left alone. The word ‘Father’ implies all
that is meant by ‘Unbegotten,’ and has moreover the advantage of suggesting at the same
time the idea of the Son. He Who is essentially Father is alone of no other. In this being of
no other is involved the sense of ‘Unbegotten.’ The title ‘unbegotten’ will not be preferred
by us to that of Father, unless we wish to make ourselves wiser than the Saviour, Who said,
‘Go and baptize in the name’ not of the Unbegotten, but ‘of the Father.’”317 To the Eunomian
contention that the word “Unbegotten” is no mere complimentary title, but required
by the strictest necessity, in that it involves the confession of what He is,318 Basil rejoins
that it is only one of many negative terms applied to the Deity, none of which completely
expresses the Divine Essence. “There exists no name which embraces the whole nature of
God, and is sufficient to declare it; more names than one, and these of very various kinds,
each in accordance with its own proper connotation, give a collective idea which may be
dim indeed and poor when compared with the whole, but is enough for us.”319 The word
“unbegotten,” like “immortal,” “invisible,” and the like, expresses only negation. “Yet essence320
is not one of the qualities which are absent, but signifies the very being of God; to
reckon this in the same category as the non-existent is to the last degree unreasonable.”321
Basil “would be quite ready to admit that the essence of God is unbegotten,” but he objects
to the statement that the essence and the unbegotten are identical.322 It is sometimes supposed
that the Catholic theologians have been hair-splitters in the sphere of the inconceivable,

and that heresy is the exponent of an amiable and reverent vagueness. In the Arian controversy
it was Arius himself who dogmatically defined with his negative “There was when He
was not,” and Eunomius with his “The essence is the unbegotten.” “What pride! What
conceit!” exclaims Basil. “The idea of imagining that one has discovered the very essence
of God most high! Assuredly in their magniloquence they quite throw into the shade even
Him who said, ‘I will exalt my throne above the stars.’323 It is not stars, it is not heaven,
that they dare to assail. It is in the very essence of the God of all the world that they boast
that they make their haunt. Let us question him as to where he acquired comprehension
of this essence. Was it from the common notion that all men share?324 This does indeed
suggest to us that there is a God, but not what God is. Was it from the teaching of the
Spirit? What teaching? Where found? What says great David, to whom God revealed the
hidden secrets of His wisdom? He distinctly asserts the unapproachableness of knowledge
of Him in the words, ‘Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain
unto it.’325 And Isaiah, who saw the glory of God, what does he tell us concerning the Divine
Essence? In his prophecy about the Christ he says, ‘Who shall declare His generation?’326
And what of Paul, the chosen vessel, in whom Christ spake, who was caught up into the
third heaven, who heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful to man to utter? What
teaching has he given us of the essence of God? When Paul is investigating the special
methods of the work of redemption327 he seems to grow dizzy before the mysterious maze
which he is contemplating, and utters the well-known words, ‘O the depth of the riches both
of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways
past finding out!’328 These things are beyond the reach even of those who have attained
the measure of Paul’s knowledge. What then is the conceit of those who announce that they
know the essence of God! I should very much like to ask them what they have to say about
the earth whereon they stand, and whereof they are born. What can they tell us of its ‘essence’?
If they can discourse without hesitation of the nature of lowly subjects which lie
beneath our feet, we will believe them when they proffer opinions about things which
transcend all human intelligence. What is the essence of the earth? How can it be comprehended?
Let them tell us whether reason or sense has reached this point! If they say sense,
by which of the senses is it comprehended? Sight? Sight perceives colour. Touch? Touch
distinguishes hard and soft, hot and cold, and the like; but no idiot would call any of these

Hearing perceives sounds and voices, which have no affinity with earth. They must then
say that they have found out the earth’s essence by reason. What? In what part of Scripture?
A tradition from what saint?329</p>
<p>“In a word, if any one wishes to realise the truth of what I am urging, let him ask himself
this question; when he wishes to understand anything about God, does he approach the
meaning of ‘the unbegotten’? I for my part see that, just as when we extend our thought
over the ages that are yet to come, we say that the life bounded by no limit is without end,
so is it when we contemplate in thought the ages of the past, and gaze on the infinity of the
life of God as we might into some unfathomable ocean. We can conceive of no beginning
from which He originated: we perceive that the life of God always transcends the bounds
of our intelligence; and so we call that in His life which is without origin, unbegotten.330
The meaning of the unbegotten is the having no origin from without.”331 As Eunomius
made ingenerateness the essence of the Divine, so, with the object of establishing the contrast
between Father and Son, he represented the being begotten to indicate the essence of the
Son.332 God, said Eunomius, being ingenerate, could never admit of generation. This
statement, Basil points out, may be understood in either of two ways. It may mean that ingenerate
nature cannot be subjected to generation. It may mean that ingenerate nature
cannot generate. Eunomius, he says, really means the latter, while he makes converts of the
multitude on the lines of the former. Eunomius makes his real meaning evident by what
he adds to his dictum, for, after saying “could never admit of generation,” he goes on, “so
as to impart His own proper nature to the begotten.”333 As in relation to the Father, so now
in relation to the Son, Basil objects to the term. Why “begotten”?334 Where did he get this
word? From what teaching? From what prophet? Basil nowhere finds the Son called “begotten”
in Scripture.335 We read that the Father begat, but nowhere that the Son was a begotten
thing. “Unto us a child is born,336 unto us a Son is given.”337 But His name is not
begotten thing but “angel of great counsel.”338 If this word had indicated the essence of the

Son, no other word would have been revealed by the Spirit.339 Why, if God begat, may we
not call that which was begotten a thing begotten? It is a terrible thing for us to coin names
for Him to Whom God has given a “name which is above every name.”340 We must not
add to or take from what is delivered to us by the Spirit.341 Things are not made for names,
but names for things.342 Eunomius unhappily was led by distinction of name into distinction
of being.343 If the Son is begotten in the sense in which Eunomius uses the word, He is
neither begotten of the essence of God nor begotten from eternity. Eunomius represents
the Son as not of the essence of the Father, because begetting is only to be thought of as a
sensual act and idea, and therefore is entirely unthinkable in connexion with the being of
God. “The essence of God does not admit of begetting; no other essence exists for the Son’s
begetting; therefore I say that the Son was begotten when non-existent.”344 Basil rejoins
that no analogy can hold between divine generation or begetting and human generation or
begetting. “Living beings which are subject to death generate through the operation of the
senses: but we must not on this account conceive of God in the same manner; nay, rather
shall we be hence guided to the truth that, because corruptible beings operate in this manner,
the Incorruptible will operate in an opposite manner.”345 “All who have even a limited
loyalty to truth ought to dismiss all corporeal similitudes. They must be very careful not to
sully their conceptions of God by material notions. They must follow the theologies346 delivered
to us by the Holy Ghost. They must shun questions which are little better than
conundrums, and admit of a dangerous double meaning. Led by the ray that shines forth
from light to the contemplation of the divine generation, they must think of a generation
worthy of God, without passion, partition, division, or time. They must conceive of the
image of the invisible God not after the analogy of images which are subsequently fashioned
by craft to match their archetype, but as of one nature and subsistence with the originating
prototype347.<gap reason="omitted"/>348 This image is not produced by imitation, for the whole nature of the

is the generation? Of what kind was it? In what manner could it be effected? The manner
is ineffable, and wholly beyond the scope of our intelligence; but we shall not on this account
throw away the foundation of our faith in Father and Son. If we try to measure everything
by our comprehension, and to suppose that what we cannot comprehend by our reasoning
is wholly non-existent, farewell to the reward of faith; farewell to the reward of hope! If we
only follow what is clear to our reason, how can we be deemed worthy of the blessings in
store for the reward of faith in things not seen”?350</p>
<p>If not of the essence of God, the Son could not be held to be eternal. “How utterly absurd,”
exclaims Basil, “to deny the glory of God to have had brightness;351 to deny the wisdom
of God to have been ever with God!<gap reason="omitted"/>The Father is of eternity. So also is the Son of eternity,
united by generation to the unbegotten nature of the Father. This is not my own statement.
I shall prove it by quoting the words of Scripture. Let me cite from the Gospel ‘In the beginning
was the Word,’352 and from the Psalm, other words spoken as in the person of the
Father, ‘From the womb before the morning I have begotten them.’353 Let us put both together,
and say, He was, and He was begotten.<gap reason="omitted"/>How absurd to seek for something higher
in the case of the unoriginate and the unbegotten! Just as absurd is it to start questions as
to time, about priority in the case of Him Who was with the Father from eternity, and
between Whom and Him that begat Him there is no interval.”354</p>
<p>A dilemma put by Eunomius was the following: When God begat the Son, the Son
either was or was not.355 If He was not, no argument could lie against Eunomius and the
Arians. If He was, the position is blasphemous and absurd, for that which is needs no begetting.356</p>
<p>To meet this dilemma, Basil drew a distinction between eternity and the being unoriginate.
357 The Eunomians, from the fact of the unoriginateness of the Father being called
eternity, maintained that unoriginateness and eternity are identical.358 Because the Son is
not unbegotten they do not even allow Him to be eternal. But there is a wide distinction to

be observed in the meaning of the terms. The word unbegotten is predicated of that which
has origin of itself, and no cause of its being: the word eternal is predicated of that which
is in being beyond all time and age.359 Wherefore the Son is both not unbegotten and
eternal.360 Eunomius was ready to give great dignity to the Son as a supreme creature. He
did not hold the essence of the Son to be common to that of the things created out of nothing.
361 He would give Him as great a preëminence as the Creator has over His own created
works.362 Basil attributes little importance to this concession, and thinks it only leads to
confusion and contradiction. If the God of the universe, being unbegotten, necessarily differs
from things begotten, and all things begotten have their common hypostasis of the nonexistent,
what alternative is there to a natural conjunction of all such things? Just as in the
one case the unapproachable effects a distinction between the natures, so in the other
equality of condition brings them into mutual contact. They say that the Son and all things
that came into being under Him are of the non-existent, and so far they make those natures
common, and yet they deny that they give Him a nature of the non-existent. For again, as
though Eunomius were Lord himself, and able to give to the Only Begotten what rank and
dignity he chooses, he goes on to argue,—We attribute to Him so much supereminence as
the Creator must of necessity have over His own creature. He does not say, “We conceive,”
or “We are of opinion,” as would be befitting when treating of God, but he says “We attribute,”
as though he himself could control the measure of the attribution. And how much
supereminence does he give? As much as the Creator must necessarily have over His own
creatures. This has not yet reached a statement of difference of substance. Human beings
in art surpass their own works, and yet are consubstantial with them, as the potter with his
clay, and the shipwright with his timber. For both are alike bodies, subject to sense, and
earthy.363 Eunomius explained the title “Only Begotten” to mean that the Son alone was
begotten and created by the Father alone, and therefore was made the most perfect minister.
“If,” rejoins Basil, “He does not possess His glory in being perfect God, if it lies only in His
being an exact and obedient subordinate, in what does He differ from the ministering spirits
who perform the work of their service without blame?364 Indeed Eunomius joins ‘created’
to ‘begotten’ with the express object of shewing that there is no distinction between the Son
and a creature!365 And how unworthy a conception of the Father that He should need a

servant to do His work! ‘He commanded and they were created.’366 What service was
needed by Him Who creates by His will alone? But in what sense are all things said by us
to be ‘through the Son’? In that the divine will, starting from the prime cause, as it were
from a source, proceeds to operation through its own image, God the Word.”367 Basil sees
that if the Son is a creature mankind is still without a revelation of the Divine. He sees that
Eunomius, “by alienating the Only Begotten from the Father, and altogether cutting Him
off from communion with Him, as far as he can, deprives us of the ascent of knowledge
which is made through the Son. Our Lord says that all that is the Father’s is His.368 Eunomius
states that there is no fellowship between the Father and Him Who is of Him.”369 If
so there is no “brightness” of glory; no “express image of hypostasis.”370 So Dorner,371 who
freely uses the latter portion of the treatise, “The main point of Basil’s opposition to Eunomius
is that the word unbegotten is not a name indicative of the essence of God, but only
of a condition of existence.372 The divine essence has other predicates. If every peculiar
mode of existence causes a distinction in essence also, then the Son cannot be of the same
essence with the Father, because He has a peculiar mode of existence, and the Father another;
and men cannot be of the same essence, because each of them represents a different mode
of existence. By the names of Father, Son, and Spirit, we do not understand different essences,
(οὐσίας), but they are names which distinguish the ὕπαρξις of each. All are God, and the
Father is no more God than the Son, as one man is no more man than another. Quantitative
differences are not reckoned in respect of essence; the question is only of being or non-being.
But this does not exclude the idea of a variety in condition in the Father and the Son (ἑτέρως
ἕχειν),—the generation of the Latter. The dignity of both is equal. The essence of Begetter
and Begotten is identical.373</p>

<p>“If the Son is subjected to the Father in the Godhead, then He must have been subjected

subjected, it is in the manhood, as for us, not in the Godhead, as for Himself.”</p>
<p>Philipp. ii. 9. On the Name above every Name.</p>
<p>“If the name above every name was given by the Father to the Son, Who was God, and
every tongue owned Him Lord, after the incarnation, because of His obedience, then before
the incarnation He neither had the name above every name nor was owned by all to be
Lord. It follows then that after the incarnation He was greater than before the incarnation,
which is absurd.” So of Matt. xxviii. 18. “We must understand this of the incarnation, and
not of the Godhead.”</p>
<p>John xiv. 28. “My Father is Greater than I.”</p>
<p>“‘Greater’ is predicated in bulk, in time, in dignity, in power, or as cause. The Father
cannot be called greater than the Son in bulk, for He is incorporeal: nor yet in time, for the
Son is Creator of times: nor yet in dignity, for He was not made what He had once not
been: nor yet in power, for ‘what things the Father doeth, these also doeth the son likewise’:
374 nor as cause, since (the Father) would be similarly greater than He and than we,
if He is cause of Him and of us. The words express rather the honour given by the Son to
the Father than any depreciation by the speaker; moreover what is greater is not necessarily
of a different essence. Man is called greater than man, and horse than horse. If the Father
is called greater, it does not immediately follow that He is of another substance. In a word,
the comparison lies between beings of one substance, not between those of different substances.
375</p>
<p>“A man is not properly said to be greater than a brute, than an inanimate thing, but
man than man and brute than brute. The Father is therefore of one substance with the Son,
even though He be called greater.”376</p>

interpreted the “minority” not of the humanity, or of the special subordination of the time when the words were
uttered. cf. Ath., Orat. c. Ar. i. § 58: “The Son says not ‘my Father is better than I,’ lest we should conceive Him
to be foreign to His nature, but ‘greater,’ not indeed in size, nor in time, but because of His generation from the
Father Himself; nay, in saying ‘greater,’ He again shews that He is proper to His essence” (Newman’s transl.).

<p>On Matt. xxiv. 36. Of Knowledge of that Day and of that Hour.377</p>
<p>“If the Son is the Creator of the world, and does not know the time of the judgment,
then He does not know what He created. For He said that He was ignorant not of the
judgment, but of the time. How can this be otherwise than absurd?</p>
<p>“If the Son has not knowledge of all things whereof the Father has knowledge, then He
spake untruly when He said ‘All things that the Father hath are mine’378 and ‘As the Father
knoweth me so know I the Father.’379 If there is a distinction between knowing the Father
and knowing the things that the Father hath, and if, in proportion as every one is greater
than what is his, it is greater to know the Father than to know what is His, then the Son,
though He knew the greater (for no man knoweth the Father save the Son),380 did not know
the less.</p>
<p>“This is impossible. He was silent concerning the season of the judgment, because it
was not expedient for men to hear. Constant expectation kindles a warmer zeal for true
religion. The knowledge that a long interval of time was to elapse would have made men
more careless about true religion, from the hope of being saved by a subsequent change of
life. How could He who had known everything up to this time (for so He said) not know
that hour also? If so, the Apostle vainly said ‘In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom
and knowledge.’381</p>
<p>“If the Holy Spirit, who ‘searcheth the deep things of God,’382 cannot be ignorant of
anything that is God’s, then, as they who will not even allow Him to be equal must contend,
the Holy Ghost is greater than the Son.”383</p>

assured that the Father could save Him. How could not He who gave the boon of

He Who had raised Lazarus and many of the dead supply life to Himself? Why did He ask
life from the Father, saying, in His fear, ‘Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from
me’? If He was dying unwillingly, He had not yet humbled Himself; He had not yet been
made obedient to the Father unto death;384 He had not given Himself, as the Apostle says,
‘who gave Himself for our sins,385 a ransom.’386 If He was dying willingly, what need of
the words ‘Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away’? No: this must not be understood
of Himself; it must be understood of those who were on the point of sinning against Him,
to prevent them from sinning; when crucified in their behalf He said, ‘Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do.’387 We must not understand words spoken in accordance

reply to them that He called us branches not of His Godhead, but of His flesh, as the Apostle
says, we are ‘the body of Christ, and members in particular,’397 and again, ‘know ye not that
your bodies are the members of Christ?’398 and in other places, ‘as is the earthy, such are
they that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as we
have borne the image of the earthy, let us all bear the image of the heavenly.’399 If the head
of the ‘man is Christ, and the head of Christ is God,’400 and man is not of one substance
with Christ, Who is God (for man is not God), but Christ is of one substance with God (for
He is God) therefore God is not the head of Christ in the same sense as Christ is the head
of man. The natures of the creature and the creative Godhead do not exactly coincide. God
is head of Christ, as Father; Christ is head of us, as Maker. If the will of the Father is that
we should believe in His Son (for this is the will of Him that sent me, that every one which
seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, may have everlasting life),401 the Son is not a Son of
will. That we should believe in Him is (an injunction) found with Him, or before Him.”402</p>

evangelist speaks falsely when he says ‘we beheld His glory’;404 and the apostle, in the words
‘They would not have crucified the Lord of glory,’405 and David in the words ‘And the King
of glory shall come in.’406 It is not therefore an increase of glory which he asks. He asks
that there may be a manifestation of the oeconomy.407 Again, if He really asked that the
glory which He had before the world might be given Him of the Father, He asked it because
He had lost it. He would never have sought to receive that of which He was in possession.
But if this was the case, He had lost not only the glory, but also the Godhead. For the glory
is inseparable from the Godhead. Therefore, according to Photinus,408 He was mere man.

and not through failure in the Godhead.”</p>

would be the first of the dead who died. If on the other hand He is called first begotten of
the dead because of His being the cause of the resurrection from the dead, He is in the same
manner called first begotten of creation, because He is the cause of the bringing of the
creature from the non existent into being. If His being called first begotten of creation indicates
that He came first into being then the Apostle, when he said, ‘all things were created

therefore no need of any brother in comparison with whom He is styled first begotten.416</p>
<p>“It might also be said that one who was before all generation was called first begotten,

<note type="footnote">416 Jerome’s Tract on the Perpetual Virginity of the Blessed Virgin appeared about 383, and was written at
Rome in the episcopate of Damasus (363–384). The work of Helvidius which Jerome controverted was not
published till about 380, and there can be no reference to him in the passage in the text. Basil is contending
against the general Arian inference, rather than against any individual statement as to who the “Brethren of the
Lord” were. cf. also dub. Hom. in Sanct. Christ. Gen. p. 600. Ed. Garn. On the whole subject see Bp. Lightfoot,
in his Ep. to the Galatians, E. S. Ffoulkes in D.C.B. s.v. Helvidius, and Archdeacon Farrar in his Life of Christ,
chap. vii., who warmly supports the Helvidian theory in opposition to the almost universal belief of the early
Church. Basil evidently has no more idea that the ἕως οὗ of Matt. i. 25, implies anything as to events subsequent
to the τόκος than the author of 2 Sam. had when he said that Michal had no child till (LXX. ἕως) the day of her
death, or St. Paul had that Christ’s reigning till (ἄχρις οὗ) He had put all enemies under His feet implied that
He would not reign afterwards. Too much importance must not be given to niceties of usage in Hellenistic
Greek, but it is a well-known distinction in Attic Greek that πρίν with the infinitive is employed where the action
is not asserted to take place, while it is used with the indicative of a past fact. Had St. Matthew written πρίν
συνῆλθον, the Helvidians might have laid still greater stress than they did on the argument from Matt. i. 18,
which St. Jerome ridicules. His writing πρὶν ἢ συνελθεῖν is what might have been expected if he wished simply
to assert that the conception was not preceded by any cohabitation.</note>

‘Create in me a clean heart, O God,’424 not asking for another, but for the cleansing of the
heart he had. And a new creature is spoken of, not as though another creation came into
being, but because the enlightened are established in better works. If the Father created the
Son for works, He created Him not on account of Himself, but on account of the works.
But that which comes into being on account of something else, and not on its own account,
is either a part of that on account of which it came into being, or is inferior. The Saviour
will then be either a part of the creature, or inferior to the creature. We must understand
the passage of the manhood. And it might be said that Solomon uttered these words of the
same wisdom whereof the Apostle makes mention in the passage ‘For after that in the wisdom
of God, the world by wisdom knew not God.’425 It must moreover be borne in mind that
the speaker is not a prophet, but a writer of proverbs. Now proverbs are figures of other
things, not the actual things which are uttered. If it was God the Son Who said, ‘The Lord
created me,’ He would rather have said, ‘The Father created me.’ Nowhere did He call Him
Lord, but always Father. The word ‘begot,’ then, must be understood in reference to God
the Son, and the word created, in reference to Him who took on Him the form of a servant.
In all these cases we do not mention two, God apart and man apart (for He was One), but
in thought we take into account the nature of each. Peter had not two in his mind when he
said, ‘Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh.’426 If, they argue, the Son is a thing begotten
and not a thing made, how does Scripture say, ‘Therefore let all the house of Israel know
assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus, Whom ye have crucified, both Lord and
Christ’?427 We must also say here that this was spoken according to the flesh about the Son
of Man; just as the angel who announced the glad tidings to the shepherds says, ‘To you is
born to-day a Saviour, Who is Christ the Lord.’428 The word ‘to-day’ could never be understood
of Him Who was before the ages. This is more clearly shewn by what comes afterwards
where it is said, ‘That same Jesus whom ye have crucified.’429 If when the Son was born430
He was then made wisdom, it is untrue that He was ‘the power of God and the wisdom of
God.’431 His wisdom did not come into being, but existed always. And so, as though of
the Father, it is said by David, ‘Be thou, God, my defender,’432 and again, ‘thou art become

my salvation,’433 and so Paul, ‘Let God be true, but every man a liar.’434 Thus the Lord ‘of
God is made unto us wisdom and sanctification and redemption.’435 Now when the Father
was made defender and true, He was not a thing made; and similarly when the Son was
made wisdom and sanctification, He was not a thing made. If it is true that there is one
God the Father, it is assuredly also true that there is one Lord Jesus Christ the Saviour. According
to them the Saviour is not God nor the Father Lord, and it is written in vain, ‘the
Lord said unto my Lord.’436 False is the statement, ‘Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed
thee.’437 False too, ‘The Lord rained from the Lord.’438 False, ‘God created in the image of
God,’439 and ‘Who is God save the Lord?’440 and ‘Who is a God save our God.’441 False
the statement of John that ‘the Word was God and the Word was with God;’442 and the
words of Thomas of the Son, ‘my Lord and my God.’443 The distinctions, then, ought to
be referred to creatures and to those who are falsely and not properly called gods, and not

eternal life.’445 It would be wrong, on account of the words ‘There shall none other be accounted
of in comparison of Him,’ to understand the Son to be greater than the Father; nor
must we suppose the Father to be the only true God. Both expressions must be used in
connexion with those who are falsely styled, but are not really, gods. In the same way it is
said in Deuteronomy, ‘So the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange God with
him.’446 If God is alone invisible and wise, it does not at once follow that He is greater than
all in all things. But the God Who is over all is necessarily superior to all. Did the Apostle,
when he styled the Saviour God over all, describe Him as greater than the Father? The idea
is absurd. The passage in question must be viewed in the same manner. The great God
cannot be less than a different God. When the Apostle said of the Son, we look for ‘that
blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ,’447
did he think of Him as greater than the Father?448 It is the Son, not the Father, Whose appearance
and advent we are waiting for. These terms are thus used without distinction of
both the Father and the Son, and no exact nicety is observed in their employment. ‘Being
equally with God’449 is identical with being equal with God.450 Since the Son ‘thought it
not robbery’ to be equal with God, how can He be unlike and unequal to God? Jews are
nearer true religion than Eunomius. Whenever the Saviour called Himself no more than
Son of God, as though it were due to the Son, if He be really Son, to be Himself equal to the
Father, they wished, it is said, to stone Him, not only because He was breaking the Sabbath,
but because, by saying that God was His own Father, He made Himself equal with God.451
Therefore, even though Eunomius is unwilling that it should be so, according both to the
Apostle and to the Saviour’s own words, the Son is equal with the Father.”</p>

<p>“If the Son has not authority over the judgment, and power to benefit some and chastise
others, how could He say, ‘The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
unto the Son’?453 And in another place, ‘The Son of man hath power on earth to forgive
sins;’454 and again, ‘All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth;’455 and to Peter, ‘I
will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven;’456 and to the disciples, ‘Verily, I say unto
you that ye which have followed me, in the regeneration,<gap reason="omitted"/>shall sit upon twelve thrones,
judging the twelve tribes of Israel.’457 The explanation is clear from the Scripture, since the
Saviour said, ‘Then will I reward every man according to his work;’458 and in another place,
‘They that have done good shall come forth unto the resurrection of life, and they that have
done evil unto the resurrection of damnation.’459 And the Apostle says, ‘We must all appear
before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body,
according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad.’460 It is therefore the part of

not really so. I have shewn this from the fact that in both the Old and the New Testament
the son is frequently styled both God and Lord. David makes this still clearer when he says,

correctly, “is not myn to geve to you but to whiche it is made redi of my fadir.” So Tyndale, “is not myne to
geve but to them for whom it is prepared of my father.” The gloss begins with Cranmer (1539), “it shall chance
unto them that it is prepared for,” and first appears in the Geneva of 1557 as the A.V. has perpetuated it. The

that followed them, and that rock was Christ,’464 and Jeremiah, ‘The gods that have not
made the heavens and the earth,<gap reason="omitted"/>let them perish under the heavens.’465 The Son is not
meant among these, for He is himself Creator of all. It is then the idols and images of the
heathen who are meant alike by the preceding passage and by the words, ‘I am the first God
and I am the last, and beside me there is no God,’466 and also, ‘Before me there was no God

<p>The Fifth Book against Eunomius is on the Holy Spirit, and therefore, even if it were of
indubitable genuineness, it would be of comparatively little importance, as the subject is
fully discussed in the treatise of his mature life. A reason advanced against its genuineness
has been the use concerning the Holy Ghost of the term God. (§ 3.) But it has been replied
that the reserve which St. Basil practiced after his elevation to the episcopate was but for a
special and temporary purpose. He calls the Spirit God in Ep. VIII. §11. At the time of the
publication of the Books against Eunomius there would be no such reason for any “economy”

add to what is furnished, however inadequately, by the translation and notes in the following

the champions of the Catholic cause. Amphilochius, to whom it was addressed, was the
author of a work which Jerome describes (De Vir. Ill., cxxxiii.) as arguing that He is God
Almighty, and to be worshipped. The Ancoratus of Epiphanius was issued in 373 in support
of the same doctrine. At about the same time Didymus, the blind master of the catechetical
school at Alexandria, wrote a treatise which is extant in St. Jerome’s Latin; and of which the

work of St. Ambrose, composed in 381, for the Emperor Gratian, is “to a considerable extent
an echo.”470</p>
<p>So in East and West a vigorous defence was maintained against the Macedonian assault.
The Catholic position is exactly defined in the Synodical Letter sent by Damasus to Paulinus
of Tyre in 378.471 Basil died at the crisis of the campaign, and with no bright Pisgah view
of the ultimate passage into peace. The generalship was to pass into other hands. There is
something of the irony of fate, or of the mystery of Providence, in the fact that the voice
condemned by Basil to struggle against the mean din and rattle of Sasima should be the
vehicle for impressing on the empire the truths which Basil held dear. Gregory of Sasima
was no archiepiscopal success at Constantinople. He was not an administrator or a man of
the world. But he was a great divine and orator, and the imperial basilica of the Athanasia
rang with outspoken declarations of the same doctrines, which Basil had more cautiously
suggested to inevitable inference. The triumph was assured, Gregory was enthroned in St.
Sophia, and under Theodosius the Catholic Faith was safe from molestation.</p>

<p>(i) As of the De Spiritu Sancto, so of the Hexæmeron, no further account need be given
here. It may, however, be noted that the Ninth Homily ends abruptly, and the latter, and
apparently more important, portion of the subject is treated of at less length than the former.
Jerome472 and Cassiodorus473 speak of nine homilies only on the creation. Socrates474 says
the Hexæmeron was completed by Gregory of Nyssa. Three orations are published among
Basil’s works, two on the creation of men and one on Paradise, which are attributed to Basil
by Combefis and Du Pin, but not considered genuine by Tillemont, Maran, Garnier, Ceillier,
and Fessler. They appear to be compositions which some editor thought congruous to the
popular work of Basil, and so appended them to it.</p>
<p>The nine discourses in the Hexæmeron all shew signs of having been delivered extempore,
and the sequence of argument and illustration is not such as to lead to the conclusion
that they were ever redacted by the author into exact literary form. We probably owe their
preservation to the skilled shorthand writers of the day.475</p>
<p>(ii) The Homilies on the Psalms as published are seventeen in number; it has however
been commonly held that the second Homily on Ps. xxviii. is not genuine, but the composition
of some plagiarist. The Homily also on Ps. xxxvii. has been generally objected to. These
are omitted from the group of the Ben. Ed., together with the first on Ps. cxiv., and that on
cxv. Maran476 thinks that none of these orations shew signs of having been delivered in the
episcopate, or of having reference to the heresy of the Pneumatomachi; two apparently point
directly to the presbyterate. In that on Ps. xiv. he speaks of an ἀμεριμνία which would better
befit priest than the primate; on Ps. cxiv. he describes himself as serving a particular church.
Both arguments seem a little far-fetched, and might be opposed on plausible grounds. Both
literal and allegorical interpretations are given. If Basil is found expressing himself in terms
similar to those of Eusebius, it is no doubt because both were inspired by Origen.477 The

Philostratus (A.D. 195). It has been thought that the systems in use in the earlier centuries of our era were
modifications of a cryptographic method employed by the Christians to circulate documents in the Church.
No examples are extant of an earlier date than the tenth century, and of these an interesting specimen is the
Paris MS. of Hermogenes described by Montfaucon, Pal. Gr. p. 351. The exact minutes of some of the Councils—

Homily on Psalm i. begins with a partial quotation from 2 Tim. iii. 16, “All Scripture is
given by inspiration of God, and is profitable,” and goes on, “and was composed by the
Spirit to the end that all of us men, as in a general hospital for souls, may choose each what
is best for his own cure.” For him, Scripture is supreme.478 As is noticed on Hom. IX.479
of the Hexæmeron, Basil is on the whole for the simpler sense. But he was a student of
Origen, and he well knows how to use allegory when he thinks fit.480 An example may be
observed in Letter VIII.,481 where there is an elaborate allegorisation of the “times and the
seasons” of Acts i. 7. An instance of the application of both systems is to be found in the
Homily on Psalm xxviii. (i.e. in A.V. xxix.). The LXX. Title is Ψαλμὸς τᾥ Δαυὶδ ἐξοδίου
σκηνῆς, Psalmus David in exitu e tabernaculo.” Primarily this is a charge delivered to the
priests and Levites on leaving their sacred offices. They are to remember all that it is their
duty to prepare for the holy service. As they go out of the Tabernacle the psalm tells them
all that it behoves them to have in readiness for the morrow, young rams (Ps. xxix. 1, LXX.),
glory and honour, glory for His name. “But to our minds, as they contemplate high and
lofty things, and by the aid of an interpretation dignified and worthy of Holy Scripture make
the Law our own, the meaning is different. There is no question of ram in flock, nor tabernacle
fashioned of lifeless material, nor departure from the temple. The tabernacle for us
is this body of ours, as the Apostle has told us in the words, ‘For we that are in this tabernacle
do groan.’482 The departure from the temple is our quitting this life. For this these words
bid us be prepared, bringing such and such things to the Lord, if the deeds done here are to
be a means to help us on our journey to the life to come.”</p>
<p>This is in the style of exegesis hitherto popular. To hearers familiar with exegesis of the
school of Origen, it is an innovation for Basil to adopt such an exclusively literal system of

moyen presque infaillible de connaitre la date des ses grands travaux exégétiques. Aussi ne doit-on pas hésiter à
assigner aux premiêres années de sa retraite la composition du commentaire d’Isaïe, dans lequel domine à peu

exposition as he does,—e.g. in Hom. IX. on the Hexæmeron,—the system which is one of
his distinguishing characteristics.483 In his common-sense literalism he is thus a link with
the historical school of Antioch, whose principles were in contrast with those of Origen and
the Alexandrians, a school represented by Theodore of Mopsuestia, Diodorus of Tarsus,
and later by Theodoret.484</p>
<p>It is remarked by Gregory of Nazianzus in his memorial oration485 that Basil used a
threefold method of enforcing Scripture on his hearers and readers. This may be understood
to be the literal, moral, and allegorical. Ceillier points out that this description, so far as we
know, applies only to the Homilies on the Psalms.</p>
<p>The praise of the Psalms, prefixed to Psalm i., is a passage of noticeable rhetorical power
and of considerable beauty. Its popularity is shewn by the fact of its being found in some
manuscripts of St. Augustine, and also in the commentary of Rufinus. The latter probably
translated it; portions of it were transcribed by St. Ambrose.486</p>
<p>“The prophets,” says St. Basil, “the historians, the law, give each a special kind of
teaching, and the exhortation of the proverbs furnishes yet another. But the use and profit
of all are included in the book of Psalms. There is prediction of thing to come. There our
memories are reminded of the past. There laws are laid down for the guidance of life. There
are directions as to conduct. The book, in a word, is a treasury of sound teaching, and
provides for every individual need. It heals the old hurts of souls, and brings about recovery
where the wound is fresh. It wins the part that is sick and preserves that which is sound.
As far as lies within its power, it destroys the passions which lord it in this life in the souls
of men. And all this it effects with a musical persuasiveness and with a gratification that
induces wise and wholesome reflexion. The Holy Spirit saw that mankind was hard to draw
to goodness, that our life’s scale inclined to pleasure, and that so we were neglectful of the
right. What plan did He adopt? He combined the delight of melody with His teaching, to
the end that by the sweetness and softness of what we heard we might, all unawares, imbibe
the blessing of the words. He acted like wise leeches, who, when they would give sour
draughts to sickly patients, put honey round about the cup. So the melodious music of the
Psalms has been designed for us, that those who are boys in years, or at least but lads in ways
of life, while they seem to be singing, may in reality be carrying on the education of the soul.
It is not easy for the inattentive to retain in their memory, when they go home, an injunction
of an apostle or prophet; but the sayings of the Psalms are sung in our houses and travel

with us through the streets. Let a man begin even to grow savage as some wild beast, and
no sooner is he soothed by psalm-singing than straightway he goes home with passions
lulled to calm and quiet by the music of the song.487</p>
<p>“A psalm is souls’ calm, herald of peace, hushing the swell and agitation of thoughts.
It soothes the passions of the soul; it brings her license under law. A psalm is welder of
friendship, atonement of adversaries, reconciliation of haters. Who can regard a man as
his enemy, when they have lifted up one voice to God together? So Psalmody gives us the
best of all boons, love. Psalmody has bethought her of concerted singing as a mighty bond
of union, and links the people together in a symphony of one song. A psalm puts fiends to
flight, and brings the aid of angels to our side; it is armour in the terrors of the night; in the
toils of the day it is refreshment; to infants it is a protection, to men in life’s prime a pride,
to elders a consolation, to women an adornment. It turns wastes into homes. It brings
wisdom into marts and meetings. To beginners it is an alphabet, to all who are advancing
an improvement, to the perfect a confirmation. It is the voice of the church. It gladdens
feasts. It produces godly sorrow. It brings a tear even from a heart of stone. A psalm is
angels’ work, the heavenly conversation, the spiritual sacrifice. Oh, the thoughtful wisdom
of the Instructor Who designed that we should at one and the same time sing and learn to
our profit! It is thus that His precepts are imprinted on our souls. A lesson that is learned
unwillingly is not likely to last, but all that is learned with pleasure and delight effects a
permanent settlement in our souls. What can you not learn from this source? You may
learn magnificent manliness, scrupulous righteousness, dignified self-control, perfect wisdom.
You may learn how to repent, and how far to endure. What good thing can you not
learn? There is a complete theology;488 a foretelling of the advent of Christ in the flesh;
threatening of judgment; hope of resurrection; fear of chastisement; promise of glory; revelation
of mysteries. Everything is stored in the book of the Psalms as in some vast treasury
open to all the world. There are many instruments of music, but the prophet has fitted it
to the instrument called Psaltery. I think the reason is that he wished to indicate the grace
sounding in him from on high by the gift of the Spirit, because of all instruments the Psaltery
is the only one which has the source of its sounds above.489 In the case of the cithara and
the lyre the metal gives forth its sound at the stroke of the plectrum from below. The Psaltery
has the source of its melodious strains above. So are we taught to be diligent in seeking the
things which are above, and not to allow ourselves to be degraded by our pleasure in the
music to the lusts of the flesh. And what I think the word of the Prophet profoundly and

wisely teaches by means of the fashion of the instrument is this,—that those whose souls
are musical and harmonious find their road to the things that are above most easy.”</p>
<p>On Psalm xiv. (in A.V. xv.) the commentary begins:</p>
<p>“Scripture, with the desire to describe to us the perfect man, the man who is ordained
to be the recipient of blessings, observes a certain order and method in the treatment of
points in him which we may contemplate, and begins from the simplest and most obvious,
‘Lord, who shall sojourn490 in thy tabernacle?’ A sojourning is a transitory dwelling. It indicates
a life not settled, but passing, in hope of our removal to the better things. It is the
part of a saint to pass through this world, and to hasten to another life. In this sense David
says of himself, ‘I am a stranger with thee and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.’491 Abraham
was a sojourner, who did not possess even so much land as to set his foot on, and when
he needed a tomb, bought one for money.492 The word teaches us that so long as he lives
in the flesh he is a sojourner, and, when he removes from this life, rests in his own home.
In this life he sojourns with strangers, but the land which he bought in the tomb to receive
his body is his own. And truly blessed is it, not to rot with things of earth as though they
were one’s own, nor cling to all that is about us here as through here were our natural fatherland,
but to be conscious of the fall from nobler things, and of our passing our time in
heaviness because of the punishment that is laid upon us, just like exiles who for some
crimes’ sake have been banished by the magistrates into regions far from the land that gave
them birth. Hard it is to find a man who will not heed present things as though they were
his own; who knows that he has the use of wealth but for a season; who reckons on the brief
duration of his health; who remembers that the bloom of human glory fades away.</p>
<p>“‘Who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle?’ The flesh that is given to man’s soul for it to
dwell in is called God’s tabernacle. Who will be found to treat this flesh as though it were
not his own? Sojourners, when they hire land that is not their own, till the estate at the will
of the owner. So, too, to us the care of the flesh has been entrusted by bond, for us to toil
with diligence therein, and make it fruitful for the use of Him Who gave it. And if the flesh
is worthy of God, it becomes verily a tabernacle of God, accordingly as He makes His
dwelling in the saints. Such is the flesh of the sojourner. ‘Lord, who shall sojourn in Thy
tabernacle?’ Then there come progress and advance to that which is more perfect. ‘And
who shall dwell in thy holy hill?’ A Jew, in earthly sense, when he hears of the ‘hill,’ turns
his thoughts to Sion. ‘Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?’ The sojourner in the flesh shall
dwell in the holy hill, he shall dwell in that hill, that heavenly country, bright and splendid,

whereof the Apostle says, ‘Ye are come unto Mount Sion, and unto the city of the living
God, the heavenly Jerusalem,’ where is the general assembly of ‘angels, and church of the
first-born, which are written in heaven.’”493</p>
<p>The Second Homily on Psalm xiv. (xv.) has a special interest in view of the denunciation
of usury alike in Scripture and in the early Church. The matter had been treated of at Nicæa.
With it may be compared Homily VII., De Avaritia.494</p>
<p>After a few words of introduction and reference to the former Homily on the same
Psalm, St. Basil proceeds;—“In depicting the character of the perfect man, of him, that is,
who is ordained to ascend to the life of everlasting peace, the prophet reckons among his
noble deeds his never having given his money upon usury. This particular sin is condemned
in many passages of Scripture. Ezekiel495 reckons taking usury and increase among the
greatest of crimes. The law distinctly utters the prohibition ‘Thou shalt not lend upon usury
to thy brother’496 and to thy neighbour. Again it is said, ‘Usury upon usury; guile upon
guile.’497 And of the city abounding in a multitude of wickednesses, what does the Psalm
say? ‘Usury and guile depart not from her streets.’498 Now the prophet instances precisely
the same point as characteristic of the perfect man, saying, ‘He that putteth not out his
money to usury.’499 For in truth it is the last pitch of inhumanity that one man, in need of
the bare necessities of life, should be compelled to borrow, and another, not satisfied with
the principal, should seek to make gain and profit for himself out of the calamities of the
poor. The Lord gave His own injunction quite plainly in the words, ‘from him that would
borrow of thee turn not thou away.’500 But what of the money lover? He sees before him
a man under stress of necessity bent to the ground in supplication. He sees him hesitating
at no act, no words, of humiliation. He sees him suffering undeserved misfortune, but he
is merciless. He does not reckon that he is a fellow-creature. He does not give in to his entreaties.
He stands stiff and sour. He is moved by no prayers; his resolution is broken by
no tears. He persists in refusal, invoking curses on his own head if he has any money about
him, and swearing that he is himself on the lookout for a friend to furnish him a loan. He
backs lies with oaths, and makes a poor addition to his stock in trade by supplementing inhumanity
with perjury. Then the suppliant mentions interest, and utters the word security.

All is changed. The frown is relaxed; with a genial smile he recalls old family connexion.
Now it is ‘my friend.’ ‘I will see,’ says he, ‘if I have any money by me. Yes; there is that sum
which a man I know has left in my hands on deposit for profit. He named very heavy interest.
However, I shall certainly take something off, and give it you on better terms.’ With
pretences of this kind and talk like this he fawns on the wretched victim, and induces him
to swallow the bait. Then he binds him with written security, adds loss of liberty to the
trouble of his pressing poverty, and is off. The man who has made himself responsible for
interest which he cannot pay has accepted voluntary slavery for life. Tell me; do you expect
to get money and profit out of the pauper? If he were in a position to add to your wealth,
why should he come begging at your door? He came seeking an ally, and he found a foe.
He was looking for medicine, and he lighted on poison. You ought to have comforted him
in his distress, but in your attempt to grow fruit on the waste you are aggravating his necessity.
Just as well might a physician go in to his patients, and instead of restoring them to
health, rob them of the little strength they might have left. This is the way in which you try
to profit by the misery of the wretched. Just as farmers pray for rain to make their fields
fatter, so you are anxious for men’s need and indigence, that your money may make more.
You forget that the addition which you are making to your sins is larger than the increase
to your wealth which you are reckoning on getting for your usury. The seeker of the loan
is helpless either way: he bethinks him of his poverty, he gives up all idea of payment as
hopeless when at the need of the moment he risks the loan. The borrower bends to necessity
and is beaten. The lender goes off secured by bills and bonds.</p>
<p>“After he has got his money, at first a man is bright and joyous; he shines with another’s
splendour, and is conspicuous by his altered mode of life. His table is lavish; his dress is
most expensive. His servants appear in finer liveries; he has flatterers and boon companions;
his rooms are full of drones innumerable. But the money slips away. Time as it runs on
adds the interest to its tale. Now night brings him no rest; no day is joyous; no sun is bright;
he is weary of his life; he hates the days that are hurrying on to the appointed period; he is
afraid of the months, for they are parents of interest. Even if he sleeps, he sees the lender
in his slumbers—a bad dream—standing by his pillow. If he wakes up, there is the anxiety
and dread of the interest. ‘The poor and the usurer,’ he exclaims, ‘meet together: the Lord
lighteneth both their eyes.’501 The lender runs like a hound after the game. The borrower
like a ready prey crouches at the coming catastrophe, for his penury robs him of the power
of speech. Both have their ready-reckoner in their hands, the one congratulating himself
as the interest mounts up, the other groaning at the growth of his calamities. ‘Drink waters
out of thine own cistern.’502 Look, that is to say, at your own resources; do not approach

other men’s springs; provide your comforts from your own reservoirs. Have you household
vessels, clothes, beast of burden, all kinds of furniture? Sell these. Rather surrender all than
lose your liberty. Ah, but—he rejoins—I am ashamed to put them up for sale. What then
do you think of another’s bringing them out a little later on, and crying your goods, and
getting rid of them for next to nothing before your very eyes? Do not go to another man’s
door. Verily ‘another man’s well is narrow.’503 Better is it to relieve your necessity gradually
by one contrivance after another than after being all in a moment elated by another man’s
means, afterwards to be stripped at once of everything. If you have anything wherewith to
pay, why do you not relieve your immediate difficulties out of these resources? If you are
insolvent, you are only trying to cure ill with ill. Decline to be blockaded by an usurer. Do
not suffer yourself to be sought out and tracked down like another man’s game.504 Usury
is the origin of lying; the beginning of ingratitude, unfairness, perjury.<gap reason="omitted"/></p>
<p>“But, you ask, how am I to live? You have hands. You have a craft. Work for wages.
Go into service. There are many ways of getting a living, many kinds of resources. You are
helpless? Ask those who have means. It is discreditable to ask? It will be much more discreditable
to rob your creditor. I do not speak thus to lay down the law. I only wish to point
out that any course is more advantageous to you than borrowing.</p>
<p>“Listen, you rich men, to the kind of advice I am giving to the poor because of your inhumanity.
Far better endure under their dire straits than undergo the troubles that are bred
of usury! But if you were obedient to the Lord, what need of these words? What is the advice
of the Master? Lend to those from whom ye do not hope to receive.505 And what kind of
loan is this, it is asked, from all which all idea of the expectation of repayment is withdrawn?
Consider the force of the expression, and you will be amazed at the loving kindness of the
legislator. When you mean to supply the need of a poor man for the Lord’s sake, the
transaction is at once a gift and a loan. Because there is no expectation of reimbursement,
it is a gift. Yet because of the munificence of the Master, Who repays on the recipient’s behalf,
it is a loan. ‘He that hath pity on the poor lendeth unto the Lord.’506 Do you not wish the
Master of the universe to be responsible for your repayment? If any wealthy man in the
town promises you repayment on behalf of others, do you admit his suretyship? But you
do not accept God, Who more than repays on behalf of the poor. Give the money lying
useless, without weighting it with increase, and both shall be benefited. To you will accrue

the security of its safe keeping. The recipients will have the advantage of its use. And if it
is increase which you seek, be satisfied with that which is given by the Lord. He will pay
the interest for the poor. Await the loving-kindness of Him Who is in truth most kind.</p>
<p>“What you are taking involves the last extremity of inhumanity. You are making your
profit out of misfortune; you are levying a tax upon tears. You are strangling the naked.
You are dealing blows on the starving. There is no pity anywhere, no sense of your kinship
to the hungry, and you call the profit you get from these sources kindly and humane! Wo
unto them that ‘put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter,’507 and call inhumanity humanity!
This surpasses even the riddle which Samson proposed to his boon companions:—‘Out of
the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.’508 Out of the inhuman
came forth humanity! Men do not gather grapes of thorns, nor figs of thistles,509 nor
humanity of usury. A corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.510 There are such people as
twelve-per-cent-men and ten-per-cent-men: I shudder to mention their names. They are
exactors by the month, like the demons who produce epilepsy, attacking the poor as the
changes of the moon come round.511</p>
<p>“Here there is an evil grant to either, to giver and to recipient. To the latter, it brings
ruin on his property; to the former, on his soul. The husbandman, when he has the ear in
store, does not search also for the seed beneath the root; you both possess the fruit and
cannot keep your hands from the principal. You plant where there is no ground. You reap
where there has been no sowing. For whom you are gathering you cannot tell. The man
from whom usury wrings tears is manifest enough; but it is doubtful who is destined to enjoy
the results of the superfluity. You have laid up in store for yourself the trouble that results
from your iniquity, but it is uncertain whether you will not leave the use of your wealth to
others. Therefore, ‘from him that would borrow of thee, turn not thou away;’512 and do
not give your money upon usury. Learn from both Old and New Testament what is profitable
for you, and so depart hence with good hope to your Lord; in Him you will receive the interest
of your good deeds,—in Jesus Christ our Lord to Whom be glory and might for ever and
ever, Amen.”</p>

<p>(iii.) The Commentary on Isaiah. The Commentary on Isaiah is placed by the Benedictine
Editors in the appendix of doubtful composition, mainly on the ground of inferiority
of style. Ceillier is strongly in favour of the genuineness of this work, and calls attention to
the fact that it is attested by strong manuscript authority, and by the recognition of St.
Maximus, of John of Damascus, of Simeon Logothetes, of Antony Melissa of Tarasius, and
of the Greek scholiast on the Epistles of St. Paul, who is supposed to be OEcumenius.
Fessler513 ranks the work among those of doubtful authority on the ground of the silence
of earlier Fathers and of the inferiority of style, as well as of apparent citations from the
Commentary of Eusebius, and of some eccentricity of opinion. He conjectures that we may
possibly have here the rough material of a proposed work on Isaiah, based mainly on Origen,
which was never completed. Garnier regards it as totally unworthy of St. Basil. Maran (
Vit. Bas. 42) would accept it, and refutes objections.</p>
<p>Among the remarks which have seemed frivolous is the comment on Is. xi. 12, that the
actual cross of the Passion was prefigured by the four parts of the universe joining in the
midst.514 Similar objections have been taken to the statement that the devils like rich fare,
and crowd the idols’ temples to enjoy the sacrificial feasts.515 On the other hand it has been
pointed out that this ingenuity in finding symbols of the cross is of a piece with that of Justin
Martyr,516 who cites the yard on the mast, the plough, and the Roman trophies, and that
Gregory of Nazianzus517 instances the same characteristic of the devils. While dwelling on
the holiness of character required for the prophetic offices, the Commentary points out518
that sometimes it has pleased God to grant it to Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar for the sake
of their great empires; to Caiaphas as the high priest; to Balaam, because of the exigencies
of the crisis at which he appeared. The unchaste lad519 who has some great sin upon his
conscience shrinks from taking his place among the faithful, and is ashamed to rank himself
with the weepers. So he tries to avoid the examination of those whose duty it is to enquire
into sins520 and he invents excuses for leaving the church before the celebration of the
mysteries. The Commentary urges521 that without penitence the best conduct is unavailing

for salvation; that God requires of the sinner not merely the abandonment of the sinful part,
but also the amends of penance, and warns men522 that they must not dream that the grace
of baptism will free them from the obligation to live a godly life. The value of tradition is
insisted on.523 Every nation, as well as every church, is said to have its own guardian angel.524</p>
<p>The excommunication reserved for certain gross sins is represented525 as a necessary
means enjoined by St. Paul to prevent the spread of wickedness. It is said526 to be an old
tradition that on leaving Paradise Adam went to live in Jewry, and there died; that after his
death, his skull appearing bare, it was carried to a certain place hence named “place of a
skull,” and that for this reason Jesus Christ, Who came to destroy death’s kingdom, willed
to die on the spot where the first fruits of mortality were interred.527</p>
<p>On Is. v. 14, “Hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure,”528
it is remarked that these are figurative expressions to denote the multitude of souls that
perish. At the same time an alternative literal meaning is admitted, the mouth being the
opening through which the souls of the damned are precipitated into a dark region beneath
the earth.</p>
<p>It is noted in some mss. that the Commentary was given to the world by an anonymous
presbyter after St. Basil’s death, who may have abstained from publishing it because it was
in an unfinished state. Erasmus was the first to undertake to print it, and to translate it into
Latin but he went no further than the preface. It was printed in Paris in 1556 by Tilmann,
with a lengthy refutation of the objections of Erasmus.529</p>

speaks of the tradition in reference to its association with the words “As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all
be made alive,” as “smooth to the ear, but not true.” One version of the tale was that Noah took Adam’s bones
with him in the ark; that on Ararat they were divided, and the head fell to Seth’s share. This he buried at Golgotha.

exhortation to enlistment in the sacred warfare; the second, on renunciation of the world

virtues to be exhibited in the life of the solitary.</p>

endurance. It has been supposed to have been written in times of special oppression and
persecution.</p>
<p>The second discourse is an exhortation to renunciation of the world. Riches are to be
abandoned to the poor. The highest life is the monastic. But this is not to be hastily and
inconsiderately embraced. To renounce monasticism and return to the world is derogatory
to a noble profession. The idea of pleasing God in the world as well as out of it is, for those
who have once quitted it, a delusion. God has given mankind the choice of two holy estates,
marriage or virginity. The law which bids us love God more than father, mother, or self,
more than wife and children, is as binding in wedlock as in celibacy. Marriage indeed demands
the greater watchfulness, for it offers the greater temptations. Monks are to be firm
against all attempts to shake their resolves. They will do well to put themselves under the
guidance of some good man of experience and pious life, learned in the Scriptures, loving
the poor more than money, superior to the seductions of flattery, and loving God above all
things. Specific directions are given for the monastic life, and monks are urged to retirement,
silence, and the study of the Scriptures.</p>
<p>The third discourse, which is brief, is a summary of similar recommendations. The
monk ought moreover to labour with his hands, to reflect upon the day of judgment, to
succour the sick, to practice hospitality, to read books of recognized genuineness, not to
dispute about the doctrine of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but to believe in and confess an
uncreate and consubstantial Trinity.</p>
<p>(ii) Next in order come the Prooemium de Judicio Dei (προοίμιον περὶ κρίματος Θεοῦ)
and the De Fide (περὶ πίστεως). These treatises were prefixed by Basil to the Moralia. He
states that, when he enquired into the true causes of the troubles which weighed heavily on
the Church, he could only refer them to breaches of the commandments of God. Hence
the divine punishment, and the need of observing the Divine Law. The apostle says that
what is needed is faith working by love. So St. Basil thought it necessary to append an exposition
of the sound faith concerning the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, and so pass

<pb n="88"/>
in order to morals.530 It has, however, been supposed by some531 that the composition
published in the plan as the De Fide is not the original tract so entitled, but a letter on the
same subject written, if not during the episcopate, at least in the presbyterate. This view
has been supported by the statement “Thus we believe and baptize.”532</p>
<p>This, however, might be said generally of the custom obtaining in the Church, without
reference to the writer’s own practice. Certainly the document appears to have no connexion
with those among which it stands, and to be an answer to some particular request for a
convenient summary couched in scriptural terms.533 Hence it does not contain the Homoousion,
and the author gives his reason for the omission—an omission which, he points
out, is in contrast with his other writings against heretics.534 Obviously, therefore, this
composition is to be placed in his later life. Yet he describes the De Fideas being anterior
to the Moralia.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that this objection to the title and date of the extant De Fide implies
nothing against its being the genuine work of the archbishop.</p>
<p>While carefully confining himself to the language of Scripture, the author points out
that even with this aid, Faith, which he defines as an impartial assent to what has been revealed
to us by the gift of God,535 must necessarily be dark and incomplete. God can only
be clearly known in heaven, when we shall see Him face to face.536 The statement that has
been requested is as follows:</p>
<p>“We believe and confess one true and good God, Father Almighty, of Whom are all
things, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ: and His one Only-begotten Son, our
Lord and God, Jesus Christ, only true, through Whom all things were made, both visible
and invisible, and by Whom all things consist: Who was in the beginning with God and
was God, and, after this, according to the Scriptures, was seen on earth and had His conversation
with men: Who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with
God, but emptied Himself, and by means of the birth from a virgin took a servant’s form,
and was formed in fashion as a man, and fulfilled all things written with reference to Him

Scriptures, and was seen by His holy disciples, and the rest, as it is written: And He ascended
into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of His Father, whence He is coming at the end of
this world, to raise all men, and to give to every man according to his conduct. Then the
just shall be taken up into life eternal and the kingdom of heaven, but the sinner shall be
condemned to eternal punishment, where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched:

guides us into all truth, and confirms all that believe, both in sure knowledge and accurate
confession, and in pious service and spiritual and true worship of God the Father, and of

<p>(iii) The Moralia (τὰ ἠθικά) is placed in 361, in the earlier days of the Anomoean heresy.
Shortly before this time the extreme Arians began to receive this name,538 and it is on the
rise of the Anomoeans that Basil is moved to write. The work comprises eighty Rules of
Life, expressed in the words of the New Testament, with special reference to the needs of
bishops, priests, and deacons, and of all persons occupied in education.</p>
<p>Penitence consists not only in ceasing to sin, but in expiating sin by tears and mortification.
539 Sins of ignorance are not free from peril of judgment.540</p>
<p>Sins into which we feel ourselves drawn against our will are the results of sins to which
we have consented.541 Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost consists in attributing to the
devil the good works which the Spirit of God works in our brethren.542 We ought carefully
to examine whether the doctrine offered us is conformable to Scripture, and if not, to reject
it.543 Nothing must be added to the inspired words of God; all that is outside Scripture is
not of faith, but is sin.544</p>

<p>(iv) The Regulæ fusius tractatæ (ὅροι κατὰ πλάτος), 55 in number, and the Regulæ
brevius tractatæ (ὅροι κατ᾽ ἐπιτομήν), in number 313, are a series of precepts for the guidance
of religious life put in the form of question and answer. The former are invariably supported
by scriptural authority.</p>
<p>Their genuineness is confirmed by strong external evidence.545 Gregory of Nazianzus
(Or. xliii. § 34) speaks of Basil’s composing rules for monastic life, and in Ep. vi. intimates
that he helped his friend in their composition.546 Rufinus (H.E. ii. 9) mentions Basil’s Instituta
Monachorum. St. Jerome (De Vir. illust. cxvi.) says that Basil wrote τὸ ἅσκητικόν, and
Photius (Cod. 191) describes the Ασχετιχυμ as including the Regulæ. Sozomen (H.E. iii. 14)
remarks that the Regulæ were sometimes attributed to Eustathius of Sebaste, but speaks of
them as generally recognised as St. Basil’s.</p>
<p>The monk who relinquishes his status after solemn profession and adoption is to be
regarded as guilty of sacrilege, and the faithful are warned against all intercourse with him,
with a reference to 2 Thess. iii. 14.547</p>

<note type="footnote">546 In this series, p. 448.</note>
<note type="footnote">547 With this may be compared the uncompromising denunciation in Letter cclxxxviii., and what is said in
the first of the three Tractatus Prævii. It has been represented that St. Basil introduced the practice of irrevocable
vows. cf. Dr. Travers Smith, St. Basil, p. 223. De Broglie, L’Eglise et l’empire, v. 180: “Avant lui, c’était, aux yeux
de beaucoup de ceux même qui s’y destinaient, une vocation libre, affaire de goût et de zèle, pouvant être dilaissée
à volonté, comme elle avait été embrassée par chois. Le sceau de la perpetiuté obligatoire, ce fut Basile qui l’imprima;
c’est à lui réellement que remonte, comme règlé commune, et comme habitude générale, l’institution des voeux
perpétuels. Helyot, Hist. des ordres monastiques, i. § 3, Bultean, Hist. des moines d’orient, p. 402, Montalembert,
Hist. des moines d’occident, i. 105, s’accordent à reconnaitre que l’usage général des voeux perpétuels remonte à
St. Basil.” To St. Basil’s posthumous influence the system may be due. But it seems questionable whether St.
Basil’s Rule included formal vows of perpetual obligation in the more modern sense. I am not quite sure that
the passages cited fully bear this out. Is the earnest exhortation not to quit the holier life consistent with a
binding pledge? Would not a more distinctly authoritative tone be adopted? cf. Letters xlv. and xlvi. It is plain
that a reminder was needed, and that the plea was possible that the profession had not the binding force of
matrimony. The line taken is rather that a monk or nun ought to remain in his or her profession, and that it is
a grievous sin to abandon it, than that there is an irrevocable contract. So in the Sermo asceticus (it is not universally
accepted), printed by Garnier between the Moralia and the Regulæ, it is said: “Before the profession of
the religious life, any one is at liberty to get the good of this life, in accordance with law and custom, and to give
himself to the yoke of wedlock. But when he has been enlisted, of his own consent, it is fitting (προσήκει) that
he keep himself for God, as one of the sacred offerings, so that he may not risk incurring the damnation of sacrilege,
by defiling in the service of this world the body consecrated by promise to God.” This προσήκει is repeated
in the Regulæ. Basil’s monk, says Fialon (Et. Hist., p. 49) was irrevocably bound by the laws of the Church, by
public opinion, and, still more, by his conscience. It is to the last that the founder of the organisation seems to</note>

<p>Children are not to be received from their parents except with full security for publicity
in their reception. They are to be carefully instructed in the Scriptures. They are not to be
allowed to make any profession till they come to years of discretion (XV.). Temperance is
a virtue, but the servants of God are not to condemn any of God’s creatures as unclean, and
are to eat what is given them. (XVIII.) Hospitality is to be exercised with the utmost
frugality and moderation, and the charge to Martha in Luke x. 41, is quoted with the reading
ὀλίγων δέ ἐστι χρεία ἢ ἑνός548 and the interpretation “few,” namely for provision, and
“one,” namely the object in view,—enough for necessity. It would be as absurd for monks
to change the simplicity of their fare on the arrival of a distinguished guest as it would be
for them to change their dress (XX.). Rule XXI. is against unevangelical contention for
places at table, and Rule XXII. regulates the monastic habit. The primary object of dress is
said to be shewn by the words of Genesis,549 where God is said to have made Adam and
Eve “coats of skins,” or, as in the LXX., χιτῶνας δερματίνους, i.e. tunics of hides. This use
of tunics was enough for covering what was unseemly. But later another object was added—
that of securing warmth by clothing. So we must keep both ends in view—decency,
and protection against the weather. Among articles of dress some are very serviceable; some
are less so. It is better to select what is most useful, so as to observe the rule of poverty, and
to avoid a variety of vestments, some for show, others for use; some for day, some for night.
A single garment must be devised to serve for all purposes, and for night as well as day. As
the soldier is known by his uniform, and the senator by his robe, so the Christian ought to
have his own dress. Shoes are to be provided on the same principle, they are to be simple
and cheap. The girdle (XXIII.) is regarded as a necessary article of dress, not only because
<note type="footnote">appeal. In Letter xlvi. the reproach is not addressed merely to a “religieuse échappé de son cloitre,” as De Broglie
has it, but to a nun guilty of unchastity. Vows of virginity were among the earliest of religious obligations. (cf.
J. Martyr, Apol. i. 15, Athenvaras, Legat. 32, Origen, C. Celsum. vii. 48.) Basil (Can. xviii.) punishes a breach of
the vow of virginity as he does adultery, but it was not till the Benedictine rule was established in Europe that
it was generally regarded as absolutely irrevocable. (cf. D.C.A. s.v. “Nun,” ii. p. 1411, and H. C. Lea’s History of
Celibacy, Philadelphia, 1867.) As a matter of fact, Basil’s coenobitic monasticism, in comparison with the “wilder
and more dreamy asceticism which prevailed in Egypt and Syria” (Milman, Hist. Christ. iii. 109), was “far more
moderate and practical.” It was a community of self-denying practical beneficence. Work and worship were
to aid one another. This was the highest life, and to quit it was desertion of and disloyalty to neighbour and
God. To Basil, is it not rather the violation of holiness than the technical breach of a formal vow which is sacrilege?
Lea (p. 101) quotes Epiphanius (Panar. 61) as saying that it was better for a lapsed monk to take a lawful
wife and be reconciled to the church through Penance. Basil in Can. lx. (p. 256) contemplates a similar reconciliation.</note>

of its practical utility, but because of the example of the Lord Who girded Himself. In Rule
XXVI. all secrets are ordered to be confided to the superintendent or bishop.550 If the superintendent
himself is in error (XXVII.) he is to be corrected by other brothers. Vicious
brethren (XXVIII.) are to be cut off like rotten limbs. Self-exaltation and discontent are
equally to be avoided (XXIX.). XXXVII. orders that devotional exercise is to be no excuse
for idleness and shirking work. Work is to be done not only as a chastisement of the body,
but for the sake of love to our neighbour and supplying weak and sick brethren with the
necessaries of life. The apostle551 says that if a man will not work he must not eat. Daily
work is as necessary as daily bread. The services of the day are thus marked out. The first
movements of heart and mind ought to be consecrated to God. Therefore early in the
morning nothing ought to be planned or purposed before we have been gladdened by the
thought of God; as it is written, “I remembered God, and was gladdened;”552 the body is
not to be set to work before we have obeyed the command, “O Lord, in the morning shalt
thou hear my voice; in the morning will I order my prayer unto thee.”553 Again at the third
hour there is to be a rising up to prayer, and the brotherhood is to be called together, even
though they happen to have been dispersed to various works. The sixth hour is also to be
marked by prayer, in obedience to the words of the Psalmist,554 “evening, and morning,
and at noon will I pray, and cry aloud: and He shall hear my voice.” To ensure deliverance
from the demon of noon-day,555 the XCIst Psalm is to be recited. The ninth hour is consecrated
to prayer by the example of the Apostles556 Peter and John, who at that hour went up
into the Temple to pray. Now the day is done. For all the boons of the day, and the good
deeds of the day, we must give thanks. For omissions there must be confession. For sins
voluntary or involuntary, or unknown, we must appease God in prayer.557 At nightfall the
XCIst Psalm is to be recited again, midnight is to be observed in obedience to the example

pray and commemorate the sacred dead. Anything like a worldly festival or common-mart
at such times is like the sacrilege of the money changers in the Temple precincts.561</p>
<p>LI. gives directions for monastic discipline. “Let the superintendent exert discipline
after the manner of a physician treating his patients. He is not angry with the sick, but fights
with the disease, and sets himself to combat their bad symptoms. If need be, he must heal
the sickness of the soul by severer treatment; for example, love of vain glory by the imposition
of lowly tasks; foolish talking, by silence; immoderate sleep, by watching and prayer; idleness,
by toil; gluttony, by fasting; murmuring, by seclusion, so that no brothers may work with

<p>Q. “How is any one to avoid the sin of man-pleasing, and looking to the praises of
men?”</p>
<p>A. “There must be a full conviction of the presence of God, an earnest intention to
please Him, and a burning desire for the blessings promised by the Lord. No one before
his Master’s very eyes is excited into dishonouring his Master and bringing condemnation
on himself, to please a fellow servant.”</p>
<p>XLVII. points out that it is a grave error to be silent when a brother sins.</p>
<p>XLIX. tells us that vain gloriousness (τὸ περπερεύεσθαι. Cf. 1 Cor. xiii. 4) consists in
taking things not for use, but for ostentation; and L. illustrates this principle in the case of
dress.</p>

<p>Q. “If a man is generally in the right, and falls into one sin, how are we to treat him?</p>

<p>CXXVIII. is on fasting.</p>
<p>Q. “Ought any one to be allowed to exercise abstinence beyond his strength, so that he
is hindered in the performance of his duty?”</p>
<p>A. “This question does not seem to me to be properly worded. Temperance562 does
not consist in abstinence from earthly food,563 wherein lies the ‘neglecting of the body’564
condemned by the Apostles, but in complete departure from one’s own wishes. And how
great is the danger of our falling away from the Lord’s commandment on account of our
own wishes is clear from the words of the Apostle, ‘fulfilling the desires of the flesh, and of
the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath.’”565 The numbers in the Coenobium
are not to fall below ten, the number of the eaters of the Paschal supper.566 Nothing is to

<note type="footnote">573 Reg. fus. tract. xv. After the Regulæ are printed, in Garnier’s Ed. 34, Constitutiones Monasticæ, with the
note that their genuineness is more suspicious than that of any of the ascetic writings. They treat of the details
of monastic life, of the virtues to be cultivated in it and the vices to be avoided. Sozomen (H.E. iii. 14) has been
supposed to refer to them. All later criticism has been unfavourable to them. cf. Maran, Vit. Bas. xliii. 7; Ceillier
VI. viii. 3; Fessler, p. 524. It may be remarked generally that the asceticism of St. Basil is eminently practical.
He has no notion of mortification for mortification’s sake,—no praise for the self-advertising and vain-glorious
rigour of the Stylites. Neglecting the body, or “not sparing the body” by exaggerated mortification, in is cclviii.
condemned as Manichæism. It is of course always an objection to exclusive exaltation of the ascetic life that it
is a kind of moral docetism, and ignores the fact that Christianity has not repudiated all concern with the body,
but is designed to elevate and to purify it. (cf. Böhringer vii. p. 150.) Basil may be not unjustly criticised from
this point of view, and accused of the very Manichæism which he distinctly condemns. But it will be remembered
that he recognises the holiness of marriage and family life, and if he thinks virginity and coenobitism a higher
life, has no mercy for the dilettante asceticism of a morbid or indolent “incivisme.” Valens, from the point of
view of a master of legions, might deplore monastic celibacy, and press Egyptian monks by thousands into the
ranks of his army. (cf. Milman, Hist. Christ. iii. 47.) Basil from his point of view was equally positive that he
was making useful citizens, and that his industrious associates, of clean and frugal lives, were doing good service.

‘Les poissons meurent,’ disait Saint Antoine, ‘quand on les tire de l’eau, et les moines s’énervent dans les villes;
rentrons vîte dans les montagnes, comme les poissons dans l‘eau.’ (Montalembert, Moines d’Occident, i. 61.) Les
moines basiliens vivent aussi dans la solitude pour gagner le ciel, mais ils ne veulent pas le gagner seuls.…Les
principaux, au moins, doivent se mêler à la société pour l’instruire. Cet homme à la chevelure négligée, à la demarche
posie, dont l’oeil nes s’égare jamais, ouvre son monastère à ses sembables, ou va les trouver, du moment qu’il s’agit
de leur edification. Son contact fortifie le clergé; il entre lui-même dans les ordres, et devient collaborateur de
l’évêque. Il va aux fètes des martyrs et prêche dans les églises. Il entre dans les maisons, prend part aux conversations,
aux repas, et, tout en evitant les longs entretiens et les liaisons aux les femmes, et le directeur et le compagnon de
piété des âmes.…Le moine ne doit pas seulement soulager les moeux de l’âme. Les maisons des pauvres, dont se
couvrait une parlie de l’Asie Mineure, étatent des asiles ouverts toutes les souffrances physiques.…Pour Basile, ces
deux institutions, le monastère et la maisons des pauvres, quoique séparées et distinctes, n’en formaient qu’une.
A ses yeux, les secours corporels n’etaient qu’un moyen d’arriver à l’âme. Pendant que la main du moine servait
les voyageurs, nourissait les pauvres, pausait les malades, ses lèvres leur distribuatent une aumône plus précieuse,
celle de la parole de Dieu.” Fialon, Ét Historique, pp. 51–53. A high ideal! Perhaps never more nearly realized
than in the Cappadocian coenobia of the fourth century.</note>

<p>Homily III. on Deut. xv. 9,574 is one of the eight translated by Rufinus. Section 2 begins:
“‘Take heed,’ it is written, ‘to thyself.’ Every living creature possesses within himself,
by the gift of God, the Ordainer of all things, certain resources for self protection. Investigate
nature with attention, and you will find that the majority of brutes have an instinctive
<note type="footnote">574 LXX, πρόσεχε σεαυτῷ.</note>

<pb n="97"/>
aversion from what is injurious; while, on the other hand, by a kind of natural attraction,
they are impelled to the enjoyment of what is beneficial to them. Wherefore also God our
Teacher has given us this grand injunction, in order that what brutes possess by nature may
accrue to us by the aid of reason, and that what is performed by brutes unwittingly may be
done by us through careful attention and constant exercise of our reasoning faculty. We
are to be diligent guardians of the resources given to us by God, ever shunning sin as brutes
shun poisons, and ever hunting after righteousness, as they seek for the herbage that is good
for food. Take heed to thyself, that thou mayest be able to discern between the noxious and
the wholesome. This taking heed is to be understood in a twofold sense. Gaze with the eyes
of the body at visible objects. Contemplate incorporeal objects with the intellectual faculty
of the soul. If we say that obedience to the charge of the text lies in the action of our eyes,
we shall see at once that this is impossible. How can there be apprehension of the whole
self through the eye? The eye cannot turn its sight upon itself; the head is beyond it; it is
ignorant of the back, the countenance, the disposition of the intestines. Yet it were impious
to argue that the charge of the Spirit cannot be obeyed. It follows then that it must be understood
of intellectual action. ‘Take heed to thyself.’ Look at thyself round about from
every point of view. Keep thy soul’s eye sleepless575 in ceaseless watch over thyself. ‘Thou
goest in the midst of snares.’576 Hidden nets are set for thee in all directions by the enemy.
Look well around thee, that thou mayest be delivered ‘as a gazelle from the net and a bird
from the snare.’577 It is because of her keen sight that the gazelle cannot be caught in the
net. It is her keen sight that gives her her name.578 And the bird, if only she take heed,
mounts on her light wing far above the wiles of the hunter.</p>
<p>“Beware lest in self protection thou prove inferior to brutes, lest haply thou be caught
in the gins and be made the devil’s prey, and be taken alive by him to do with thee as he
will.”</p>
<p>A striking passage from the same Homily is thus rendered by Rufinus: “Considera ergo
primo omnium quod homo es, id est solum in terres animal ipsis divinis manibus formatum.
Nonne sufficeret hoc solum recte atque integre sapienti ad magnum summumque solutium,
quod ipsius Dei manibus qui omnia reliqua præcepti solius fecit auctoritate subsistere, homo
fictus es et formatus? Tum deinde quod cum ad imaginem Creatoris et similitudinem sis,
potes sponte etiam ad angelorum dignitatem culmenque remeare. Animam namque accepisti

<p>Homily VI., on Luke xii. 18, is on selfish wealth and greed.</p>
<p>Beware, says the preacher,580 lest the fate of the fool of the text be thine. “These things
are written that we may shun their imitation. Imitate the earth, O man. Bear fruit, as she
does, lest thou prove inferior to that which is without life. She produces her fruits, not that
she may enjoy them, but for thy service. Thou dost gather for thyself whatever fruit of good
works thou hast strewn, because the grace of good works returns to the giver. Thou hast
given to the poor, and the gift becomes thine own, and comes back with increase. Just as
grain that has fallen on the earth becomes a gain to the sower, so the loaf thrown to the
hungry man renders abundant fruit thereafter. Be the end of thy husbandry the beginning
of the heavenly sowing. ‘Sow,’ it is written, ‘to yourselves in righteousness.’581 Why then

art thou distressed? Why dost thou harass thyself in thy efforts to shut up thy riches in clay
and bricks? ‘A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches.’582 If thou admire riches
because of the honour that comes from them, bethink thee how very much more it tends
to thine honour that thou shouldst be called the father of innumerable children than that
thou shouldst possess innumerable staters in a purse. Thy wealth thou wilt leave behind
thee here, even though thou like it not. The honour won by thy good deeds thou shalt
convey with thee to the Master. Then all people standing round about thee in the presence
of the universal Judge shall hail thee as feeder and benefactor, and give thee all the names
that tell of loving kindness. Dost thou not see theatre-goers flinging away their wealth on
boxers and buffoons and beast-fighters, fellows whom it is disgusting even to see, for the
sake of the honour of a moment, and the cheers and clapping of the crowd? And art thou
a niggard in thy expenses, when thou art destined to attain glory so great? God will welcome
thee, angels will laud thee, mankind from the very beginning will call thee blessed. For thy
stewardship of these corruptible things thy reward shall be glory everlasting, a crown of
righteousness, the heavenly kingdom. Thou thinkest nothing of all this. Thy heart is so
fixed on the present that thou despisest what is waited for in hope. Come then; dispose of
thy wealth in various directions. ‘Be generous and liberal in thy expenditure on the poor.
Let it be said of thee, ‘He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth
for ever.’583 Do not press heavily on necessity and sell for great prices. Do not wait for a
famine before thou openest thy barns. ‘He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse
him.’584 Watch not for a time of want for gold’s sake—for public scarcity to promote thy
private profit. Drive not a huckster’s bargains out of the troubles of mankind. Make not
God’s wrathful visitation an opportunity for abundance. Wound not the sores of men
smitten by the scourge. Thou keepest thine eye on thy gold, and wilt not look at thy brother.
Thou knowest the marks on the money, and canst distinguish good from bad. Thou canst
not tell who is thy brother in the day of distress.”</p>
<p>The conclusion is585 “‘Ah!’—it is said—‘words are all very fine: gold is finer.’ I make
the same impression as I do when I am preaching to libertines against their unchastity.
Their mistress is blamed, and the mere mention of her serves but to enkindle their passions.
How can I bring before your eyes the poor man’s sufferings that thou mayest know out of
what creep groanings thou art accumulating thy treasures, and of what high value will seem
to thee in the day of judgment the famous words, ‘Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit
the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungred and

ye gave me meat: I was thirsty and ye gave me drink:…I was naked and ye clothed me.’586
What shuddering, what sweat, what darkness will be shed round thee, as thou hearest the
words of condemnation!—‘Depart from me, ye cursed, into outer darkness prepared for
the devil and his angels: for I was an hungred and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty and
ye gave me no drink:<gap reason="omitted"/>I was naked and ye clothed me not.’587 I have told thee what I have
thought profitable. To thee now it is clear and plain what are the good things promised for
thee if thou obey. If thou disobey, for thee the threat is written. I pray that thou mayest
change to a better mind and thus escape its peril. In this way thy own wealth will be thy
redemption. Thus thou mayest advance to the heavenly blessings prepared for thee by the
grave of Him who hath called us all into His own kingdom, to Whom be glory and might
for ever and ever. Amen.”</p>
<p>Homily IX. is a demonstration that God is not the Author of Evil. It has been conjectured
that it was delivered shortly after some such public calamity as the destruction of Nicæa in
368. St. Basil naturally touches on passages which have from time to time caused some
perplexity on this subject. He asks588 if God is not the Author of evil, how is it said “I form
the light and create darkness, I make peace and create evil,”589 and again, “The evil came
down from the Lord unto the gate of Jerusalem,”590 and again, “Shall there be evil in a city
and the Lord hath not done it,”591 and in the great song of Moses, “See now that I, even I,
am he and there is no god with me: I kill and I make alive, I wound and I heal”?592 But to
any one who understands the meaning of Scripture no one of these passages accuses God
of being the Cause and Creator of evil. He who uses the words, “I form the light and create
darkness,” describes Himself not as Creator of any evil, but as Demiurge of creation. “It is
lest thou shouldst suppose that there is one cause of light and another of darkness that He
described Himself as being Creator and Artificer of parts of creation which seem to be mutually
opposed. It is to prevent thy seeking one Demiurge of fire, another of water, one of
air and another of earth, these seeming to have a kind of mutual opposition and contrariety

of qualities. By adopting these views many have ere now fallen into polytheism, but He
makes peace and creates evil. Unquestionably He makes peace in thee when He brings
peace into thy mind by His good teaching, and calms the rebel passions of thy soul. And
He creates evil, that is to say, He reduces those evil passions to order, and brings them to a
better state so that they may cease to be evil and may adopt the nature of good. ‘Create in
me a clean heart, O God.’593 This does not mean Make now for the first time;594 it means
Renew the heart that had become old from wickedness. The object is that He may make both
one.595 The word create is used not to imply the bringing out of nothing, but the bringing
into order those which already existed. So it is said, ‘If any man be in Christ he is a new
creature.’596 Again, Moses says, ‘Is not He thy Father that hath bought thee? Hath He not
made thee and created thee?’597 Now, the creation put in order after the making evidently
teaches us that the word creation, as is commonly the case, is used with the idea of improvement.
And so it is thus that He makes peace, out of creating evil; that is, by transforming
and bringing to improvement. Furthermore, even if you understand peace to be freedom
from war, and evil to mean the troubles which are the lot of those who make war; marches
into far regions, labours, vigils, terrors, sweatings, wounds, slaughters, taking of towns,
slavery, exile, piteous spectacles of captives; and, in a word, all the evils that follow upon
war, all these things, I say, happen by the just judgment of God, Who brings vengeance
through war on those who deserve punishment. Should you have wished that Sodom had
not been burnt after her notorious wickedness? Or that Jerusalem had not been overturned,
nor her temple made desolate after the horrible wickedness of the Jews against the Lord?
How otherwise was it right for these things to come to pass than by the hands of the Romans
to whom our Lord had been delivered by the enemies of His life, the Jews? Wherefore it
does sometimes come to pass that the calamities of war are righteously inflicted on those
who deserve them—if you like to understand the words ‘I kill and I make alive’ in their obvious
sense. Fear edifies the simple. ‘I wound and I heal’ is at once perceived to be salutary.
The blow strikes terror; the cure attracts to love. But it is permissible to thee to find a
higher meaning in the words, ‘I kill’—by sin; ‘I make alive’—by righteousness. ‘Though our
outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.’598 He does not kill one
and make another alive, but He makes the same man alive by the very means by which He
kills him; He heals him by the blows which He inflicts upon him. As the proverb has it,

‘Thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliver his soul from hell.’599 The flesh is
smitten that the soul may be healed; sin is put to death that righteousness may live. In another
passage600 it is argued that death is not an evil. Deaths come from God. Yet death is
not absolutely an evil, except in the case of the death of the sinner, in which case departure
from this world is a beginning of the punishments of hell. On the other hand, of the evils
of hell the cause is not God, but ourselves. The origin and root of sin is what is in our own
control and our free will.”</p>
<p>Homily XII. is “on the beginning of the proverbs.” “The proverbs of Solomon, the son
of David, king of Israel.”601</p>
<p>“The name proverbs (παροιμίαι) has been by heathen writers used of common expressions,
and of those which are generally used in the streets. Among them a way is called
οἰμος, whence they define a παροιμία to be a common expression, which has become trite
through vulgar usage, and which it is possible to transfer from a limited number of subjects
to many analogous subjects.602 With Christians the παροιμία is a serviceable utterance,
conveyed with a certain amount of obscurity, containing an obvious meaning of much
utility, and at the same time involving a depth of meaning in its inner sense. Whence the
Lord says: ‘These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs, but the time cometh when I
shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.’”603</p>
<p>On the “wisdom and instruction” of verse 2, it is said: Wisdom is the science of things
both human and divine, and of their causes. He, therefore, who is an effective theologian604
knows wisdom. The quotation of 1 Cor. ii. 6, follows.</p>
<p>On general education it is said,605 “The acquisition of sciences is termed education,606

it is of no small importance, with a view to man’s sound condition,609 that he should not
devote himself to any sciences whatsoever, but should become acquainted with the education
which is most profitable. It has ere now happened that men who have spent their time in
the study of geometry, the discovery of the Egyptians, or of astrology, the favourite pursuit
of the Chaldæans, or have been addicted to the loftier natural philosophy610 which is concerned
with figures and shadows, have looked with contempt on the education which is
based upon the divine oracles. Numbers of students have been occupied with paltry rhetoric,
and the solution of sophisms, the subject matter of all of which is the false and unreal. Even
poetry is dependent for its existence on its myths.611 Rhetoric would not be but for craft
in speech. Sophistics must have their fallacies. Many men for the sake of these pursuits
have disregarded the knowledge of God, and have grown old in the search for the unreal.
It is therefore necessary that we should have a full knowledge of education, in order to
choose the profitable, and to reject the unintelligent and the injurious. Words of wisdom
will be discerned by the attentive reader of the Proverbs, who thence patiently extracts what
is for his good.”</p>
<p>The Homily concludes with an exhortation to rule life by the highest standard.</p>
<p>“Hold fast, then, to the rudder of life. Guide thine eye, lest haply at any time through
thine eyes there beat upon thee the vehement wave of lust. Guide ear and tongue, lest the
one receive aught harmful, or the other speak forbidden words. Let not the tempest of
passion overwhelm thee. Let no blows of despondency beat thee down; no weight of sorrow
drown thee in its depths. Our feelings are waves. Rise above them, and thou wilt be a safe
steersman of life. Fail to avoid each and all of them skilfully and steadily, and, like some
untrimmed boat, with life’s dangers all round about thee, thou wilt be sunk in the deep sea
of sin. Hear then how thou mayest acquire the steersman’s skill. Men at sea are wont to
lift up their eyes to heaven. It is from heaven that they get guidance for their cruise; by day
from the sun, and by night from the Bear, or from some of the ever-shining stars. By these
they reckon their right course. Do thou too keep thine eye fixed on heaven, as the Psalmist
did who said, ‘Unto thee lift I up mine eye, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.’612 Keep
thine eyes on the Sun of righteousness. Directed by the commandments of the Lord, as by

<p>Homilies XV. and XVI. are more distinctly dogmatic. They do not present the doctrines
of which they treat in any special way. XV., De Fide, is concerned rather with the frame of
mind of the holder and expounder of the Faith than with any dogmatic formula.</p>
<p>XVI., on John i. 1, begins by asserting that every utterance of the gospels is grander than
the rest of the lessons of the Spirit, inasmuch as, while in the latter He has spoken to us
through His servants the prophets, in the gospels the Master has conversed with us face to
face. “The most mighty voiced herald of the actual gospel proclamation, who uttered words
loud beyond all hearing and lofty beyond all understanding, is John, the son of thunder, the
prelude of whose gospel is the text.” After repeating the words the preacher goes on to say
that he has known many who are not within the limits of the word of truth, many of the
heathen, that is, “who have prided themselves upon the wisdom of this world, who in their
admiration for these words have ventured to insert them among their own writings. For
the devil is a thief, and carries off our property for the use of his own prophets.”615</p>

words, what are we to do, who are disciples of the Spirit?<gap reason="omitted"/>Hold fast to the text, and you

the words ‘In the beginning.’ The highest point of beginning is beyond comprehension;

that the phrase has more than one meaning. There are in this world many beginnings of
many things, yet there is one beginning which is beyond them all. ‘Beginning of good way,’
says the Proverb. But the beginning of a way is the first movement whereby we begin the
journey of which the earlier part can be discovered. And, ‘The fear of the Lord is the beginning
of wisdom.’616 To this beginning is prefixed something else, for elementary instruction
is the beginning of the comprehension of arts. The fear of the Lord is then a primary element
of wisdom, but there is something anterior to this beginning—the condition of the soul,
before it has been taught wisdom and apprehended the fear of the Lord.<gap reason="omitted"/>The point is the
beginning of the line, and the line is the beginning of the surface, and the surface is the beginning

But the beginning in the text is like none of these.In the beginning was the Word! Marvellous
utterance! How all the words are found to be combined in mutual equality of force!
‘Was’ has the same force as ‘In the beginning.’ Where is the blasphemer? Where is the
tongue that fights against Christ? Where is the tongue that said, ‘There was when He was
not’? Hear the gospel: ‘In the beginning was. ’ If He was in the beginning, when was He
not? Shall I bewail their impiety or execrate their want of instruction? But, it is argued,
before He was begotten, He was not. Do you know when He was begotten, that you may
introduce the idea of priority to the time? For the word ‘before’ is a word of time, placing
one thing before another in antiquity. In what way is it reasonable that the Creator of time
should have a generation subjected to terms of time? ‘In the beginning was—’ Never give
up the was, and you never give any room for the vile blasphemy to slip in. Mariners laugh
at the storm, when they are riding upon two anchors. So will you laugh to scorn this vile
agitation which is being driven on the world by the blasts of wickedness, and tosses the faith
of many to and fro, if only you will keep your soul moored safely in the security of these
words.”</p>
<p>In § 4 on the force of with God.617 “Note with admiration the exact appropriateness of
every single word. It is not said ‘The Word was in God.’ It runs ‘was with God.’ This is to
set forth the proper character of the hypostasis. The Evangelist did not say ‘in God,’ to avoid
giving any pretext for the confusion of the hypostasis. That is the vile blasphemy of men
who are endeavouring to confound all things together, asserting that Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, form one subject matter, and that different appellations are applied to one thing.
The impiety is vile, and no less to be shunned than that of those who blasphemously maintain
that the Son is in essence unlike God the Father. The Word was with God. Immediately
after using the term Word to demonstrate the impassibility of the generation, he forthwith
gives an explanation to do away with the mischief arising in us from the term Word. As

though suddenly rescuing Him from the blasphemers’ calumny, he asks, what is the Word?
The Word was God. Do not put before me any ingenious distinctions of phrase; do not with
your wily cleverness blaspheme the teachings of the Spirit. You have the definitive statement.
Submit to the Lord. The Word was God.”</p>
<p>Homily XXIV., against the Sabellians, Arians, and Anomoeans, repeats points which
are brought out again and again in the De Spiritu Sancto, in the work Against Eunomius,
and in some of the Letters.</p>
<p>Arianism is practical paganism, for to make the Son a creature, and at the same time to
offer Him worship, is to reintroduce polytheism. Sabellianism is practical Judaism,—a
denial of the Son.618 John i. 1, xiv. 9, 7, xvi. 28, and viii. 16 are quoted against both extremes.
There may be a note of time in the admitted impatience of the auditory at hearing of every
other subject than the Holy Spirit. The preacher is constrained to speak upon this topic,
and he speaks with the combined caution and completeness which characterize the De
Spiritu Sancto. “Your ears,” he says, “are all eager to hear something concerning the Holy
lxi
Ghost. My wish would be, as I have received in all simplicity, as I have assented with
guileless agreement, so to deliver the doctrine to you my hearers. I would if I could avoid
being constantly questioned on the same point. I would have my disciples convinced of
one consent. But you stand round me rather as judges than as learners. Your desire is rather
to test and try me than to acquire anything for yourselves. I must therefore, as it were, make
my defence before the court, again and again giving answer, and again and again saying
what I have received. And you I exhort not to be specially anxious to hear from me what
is pleasing to yourselves, but rather what is pleasing to the Lord, what is in harmony with
the Scriptures, what is not in opposition to the Fathers. What, then, I asserted concerning
the Son, that we ought to acknowledge His proper Person, this I have also to say concerning
the Holy Spirit. The Spirit is not identical with the Father, because of its being written ‘God
is a Spirit.’619 Nor on the other hand is there one Person of Son and of Spirit, because it is
said, ‘If any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his.…Christ is in you.’620 From
this passage some persons have been deceived into the opinion that the Spirit and Christ
are identical. But what do we assert? That in this passage is declared the intimate relation
of nature and not a confusion of persons. For there exists the Father having His existence
perfect and independent, root and fountain of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. There exists
also the Son living in full Godhead, Word and begotten offspring of the Father, independent.
Full too is the Spirit, not part of another, but contemplated whole and perfect in Himself.
The Son is inseparably conjoined with the Father and the Spirit with the Son. For there is

<pb n="107"/>
nothing to divide nor to cut asunder the eternal conjunction. No age intervenes, nor yet
can our soul entertain a thought of separation as though the Only-begotten were not ever
with the Father, or the Holy Ghost not co-existent with the Son. Whenever then we conjoin
the Trinity, be careful not to imagine the Three as parts of one undivided thing, but receive
the idea of the undivided and common essence of three perfect incorporeal [existences].
Wherever is the presence of the Holy Spirit, there is the indwelling of Christ: wherever
Christ is, there the Father is present. ‘Know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy
Ghost which is in you ?’”621</p>
<p>First of the Homilies on moral topics come I. and II. on Fasting. The former is of uncontested
genuineness. Erasmus rejected the latter, but it is accepted without hesitation by
Garnier, Maran, and Ceillier, and is said by the last named to be quoted as Basil’s by John
of Damascus and Symeon Logothetes. From Homily I. two passages are cited by St. Augustine
against the Pelagians.622 The text is Ps. lxxx. 3. “Reverence,” says one passage,623 “the hoary
head of fasting. It is coæval with mankind. Fasting was ordained in Paradise. The first injunction
was delivered to Adam, ‘Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt
not eat.’624 ‘Thou shalt not eat’ is a law of fasting and abstinence.” The general argument
is rather against excess than in support of ceremonial abstinence. In Paradise there was no
wine, no butchery of beasts, no eating of flesh. Wine came in after the flood. Noah became
drunk because wine was new to him. So fasting is older than drunkenness. Esau was defiled,
and made his brother’s slave, for the sake of a single meal. It was fasting and prayer which
gave Samuel to Hannah. Fasting brought forth Samson. Fasting begets prophets, strengthens
strong men. Fasting makes lawgivers wise, is the soul’s safeguard, the body’s trusty comrade,
the armour of the champion, the training of the athlete.</p>
<p>The conclusion is a warning against mere carnal abstinence.625 “Beware of limiting the
good of fasting to mere abstinence from meats. Real fasting is alienation from evil. ‘Loose
the bands of wickedness.’626 Forgive your neighbour the mischief he has done you. Forgive
him his trespasses against you. Do not ‘fast for strife and debate.’627 You do not devour
flesh, but you devour your brother. You abstain from wine, but you indulge in outrages.
You wait for evening before you take food, but you spend the day in the law courts. Wo to
those who are ‘drunken, but not with wine.’628 Anger is the intoxication of the soul, and

makes it out of its wits like wine. Drunkenness, too, is sorrow, and drowns our intelligence.
Another drunkenness is needless fear. In a word, whatever passion makes the soul beside
herself may be called drunkenness.…Dost thou know Whom thou art ordained to receive
as thy guest? He Who has promised that He and His Father will come and make their abode
with thee.629 Why do you allow drunkenness to enter in, and shut the door on the Lord?
Why allow the foe to come in and occupy your strongholds? Drunkenness dare not receive
the Lord; it drives away the Spirit. Smoke drives away bees, and debauch drives away the
gifts of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Wilt thou see the nobility of fasting? Compare this evening with to-morrow evening:
thou wilt see the town turned from riot and disturbance to profound calm. Would that today
might be like to-morrow in solemnity, and the morrow no less cheerful than to-day.
May the Lord Who has brought us to this period of time grant to us, as to gladiators and
wrestlers, that we may shew firmness and constancy in the beginning of contests, and may
reach that day which is the Queen of Crowns; that we may remember now the passion of
salvation, and in the age to come enjoy the requital of our deeds in this life, in the just
judgment of Christ.”630</p>
<p>Homily IV. on the giving of thanks (περὶ εὐχαριστίας), is on text 1 Thess. v. 16. Our
Lord, it is remarked, wept over Lazarus, and He called them that mourn blessed. How631
is this to be reconciled with the charge “Rejoice alway”? “Tears and joy have not a common
origin. On the one hand, while the breath is held in round the heart, tears spontaneously
gush forth, as at some blow, when an unforeseen calamity smites upon the soul. Joy on the
other hand is like a leaping up of the soul rejoicing when things go well. Hence come different
appearances of the body. The sorrowful are pale, livid, chilly. The habit of the joyous and
cheerful is blooming and ruddy; their soul all but leaps out of their body for gladness. On
all this I shall say that the lamentations and tears of the saints were caused by their love to
God. So, with their eyes ever fixed on the object of their love, and from hence gathering
greater joy for themselves, they devoted themselves to the interests of their fellow-servants.
Weeping over sinners, they brought them to better ways by their tears. But just as men
standing safe on the seashore, while they feel for those who are drowning in the deep, do
not lose their own safety in their anxiety for those in peril, so those who groan over the sins
of their neighbours do not destroy their own proper cheerfulness. Nay, they rather increase
it, in that, through their tears over their brother, they are made worthy of the joy of the
Lord. Wherefore, blessed are they that weep; blessed are they that mourn; for they shall

themselves be comforted; they themselves shall laugh. But by laughter is meant not the
noise that comes out through the cheeks from the boiling of the blood, but cheerfulness
pure and untainted with despondency. The Apostle allows us to weep with weepers, for
this tear is made, as it were, a seed and loan to be repaid with everlasting joy. Mount in
mind with me, and contemplate the condition of the angels; see if any other condition becomes
them but one of joy and gladness. It is for that they are counted worthy to stand beside
God, and to enjoy the ineffable beauty and glory of our Creator. It is in urging us on to that
life that the Apostle bids us always rejoice.”</p>
<p>The Homily contains an eloquent exhortation to Christian fortitude in calamity, and
concludes with the charge to look beyond present grief to future felicity. “Hast thou dishonour?
Look to the glory which through patience is laid up for thee in heaven. Hast thou
suffered loss? Fix thine eyes on the heavenly riches, and on the treasure which thou hast
put by for thyself through thy good works. Hast thou suffered exile? Thy fatherland is the
heavenly Jerusalem. Hast thou lost a child? Thou hast angels, with whom thou shalt dance
about the throne of God, and shalt be glad with everlasting joy. Set expected joys over
against present griefs, and thus thou wilt preserve for thyself that calm and quiet of the soul
whither the injunction of the Apostle calls us. Let not the brightness of human success fill
thy soul with immoderate joy; let not grief bring low thy soul’s high and lofty exaltation
through sadness and anguish. Thou must be trained in the lessons of this life before thou
canst live the calm and quiet life to come. Thou wilt achieve this without difficulty, if thou
keep ever with thee the charge to rejoice alway. Dismiss the worries of the flesh. Gather
together the joys of the soul. Rise above the sensible perception of present things. Fix thy
mind on the hope of things eternal. Of these the mere thought suffices to fill the soul with
gladness, and to plant in our hearts the happiness of angels.”</p>
<p>Homily VII., against the rich, follows much the same line of argument as VI. Two main
considerations are urged against the love of worldly wealth; firstly, the thought of the day
of judgment; secondly, the fleeting and unstable nature of the riches themselves. The luxury
of the fourth century, as represented by Basil, is much the same as the luxury of the nineteenth.</p>
<p>“I am filled with amazement,” says the preacher, “at the invention of superfluities. The
vehicles are countless, some for conveying goods, others for carrying their owners; all covered
with brass and with silver. There are a vast number of horses, whose pedigrees are kept like
men’s, and their descent from noble sires recorded. Some are for carrying their haughty
owners about the town, some are hunters, some are hacks. Bits, girths, collars, are all of
silver, all decked with gold. Scarlet cloths make the horses as gay as bridegrooms. There is
a host of mules, distinguished by their colours, and their muleteers with them, one after
another, some before and some behind. Of other household servants the number is endless,
who satisfy all the requirements of men’s extravagance; agents, stewards, gardeners, and

<pb n="110"/>
craftsmen, skilled in every art that can minister to necessity or to enjoyment and luxury;
cooks, confectioners, butlers, huntsmen, sculptors, painters, devisers and creators of pleasure
of every kind. Look at the herds of camels, some for carriage, some for pasture; troops of
horses, droves of oxen, flocks of sheep, herds of swine with their keepers, land to feed all
these, and to increase men’s riches by its produce; baths in town, baths in the country; houses
shining all over with every variety of marble,—some with stone of Phrygia, others with slabs
of Spartan or Thessalian.632 There must be some houses warm in winter,633 and others
cool in summer. The pavement is of mosaic, the ceiling gilded. If any part of the wall escapes
the slabs, it is embellished with painted flowers.…You who dress your walls, and let your
fellow-creatures go bare, what will you answer to the Judge? You who harness your horses
with splendour, and despise your brother if he is ill-dressed; who let your wheat rot, and
will not feed the hungry; who hide your gold, and despise the distressed? And, if you have
a wealth-loving wife, the plague is twice as bad. She keeps your luxury ablaze; she increases
your love of pleasure; she gives the goad to your superfluous appetites; her heart is set on
stones,—pearls, emeralds, and sapphires.634 Gold she works and gold she weaves,635 and
increases the mischief with never-ending frivolities. And her interest in all these things is
no mere by-play: it is the care of night and day. Then what innumerable flatterers wait
upon their idle wants! They must have their dyers of bright colours, their goldsmiths, their
perfumes their weavers, their embroiderers. With all their behests they do not leave their
husbands breathing time. No fortune is vast enough to satisfy a woman’s wants,—no, not
if it were to flow like a river! They are as eager for foreign perfumes as for oil from the
market. They must have the treasures of the sea, shells and pinnas,636 and more of them
than wool from the sheep’s back. Gold encircling precious stones serves now for an ornament
for their foreheads, now for their necks. There is more gold in their girdles; more gold
fastens hands and feet. These gold-loving ladies are delighted to be bound by golden fetters,—
only let the chain be gold! When will the man have time to care for his soul, who has
to serve a woman’s fancies?”</p>

lion hath roared: who will not fear?” National calamity is traced to national sin, specially
to neglect of the poor. Children, it appears,638 were allowed a holiday from school to attend
the public services held to deprecate the divine wrath. Crowds of men, to whose sins the
distress was more due than to the innocent children, wandered cheerfully about the town
instead of coming to church.</p>
<p>Homily X. is against the angry. Section 2 contains a description of the outward appearance
of the angry men. “About the heart of those who are eager to requite evil for evil, the
blood boils as though it were stirred and sputtering by the force of fire. On the surface it
breaks out and shews the angry man in other form, familiar and well known to all, as though
it were changing a mask upon the stage. The proper and usual eyes of the angry man are
recognized no more; his gaze is unsteady, and fires up in a moment. He whets his teeth like
boars joining battle. His countenance is livid and suffused with blood. His body seems to
swell. His veins are ruptured, as his breath struggles under the storm within. His voice is
rough and strained. His speech—broken and falling from him at random—proceeds without
distinction, without arrangement, and without meaning. When he is roused by those who
are irritating him, like a flame with plenty of fuel, to an inextinguishable pitch, then, ah!
then indeed the spectacle is indescribable and unendurable. See the hands lifted against his
fellows, and attacking every part of their bodies; see the feet jumping without restraint on
dangerous parts. See whatever comes to hand turned into a weapon for his mad frenzy.
The record of the progress from words to wounds recalls familiar lines which probably Basil
never read.639 Rage rouses strife; strife begets abuse; abuse, blows; blows, wounds; and from
wounds often comes death.”</p>
<p>St. Basil, however, does not omit to notice640 that there is such a thing as righteous indignation,
and that we may “be angry and sin not.” “God forbid that we should turn into
occasions for sin gifts given to us by the Creator for our salvation! Anger, stirred at the
proper time and in the proper manner, is an efficient cause of manliness, patience, and endurance.<gap reason="omitted"/>
Anger is to be used as a weapon. So Moses, meekest of men, armed the hands
of the Levites for the slaughter of their brethren, to punish idolatry. The wrath of Phinehas
was justifiable. So was the wrath of Samuel against Agag. Thus, anger very often is made
the minister of good deeds.”</p>
<p>Homily XI., against Envy, adduces the instances of Saul’s envy of David, and that of the
patriarchs against Joseph. It is pointed out that envy grows out of familiarity and proximity.
“A man is envied of his neighbour.”641 The Scythian does not envy the Egyptian. Envy

arises among fellow-countrymen. The remedy for this vice is to recognise the pettiness of
the common objects of human ambition, and to aspire to eternal joys. If riches are a mere
means to unrighteousness,642 wo be to the rich man! If they are a ministering to virtue,
there is no room for envy, since the common advantages proceeding from them are open
to all,—unless any one out of superfluity of wickedness envies himself his own good things!</p>
<p>In Homily XIII., on Holy Baptism, St. Basil combats an error which had naturally arisen
out of the practice of postponing baptism. The delay was made an occasion of license and
indulgence. St. Augustine643 cites the homily as St. Chrysostom’s, but the quotation has
not weakened the general acceptance of the composition as Basil’s, and as one of those referred
to by Amphilochius.644 Ceillier mentions its citation by the emperor Justinian.645
It was apparently delivered at Easter. Baptism is good at all times.646 “Art thou a young
man? Secure thy youth by the bridle of baptism. Has thy prime passed by? Do not be deprived
of thy viaticum. Do not lose thy safeguard. Do not think of the eleventh hour as of
the first. It is fitting that even at the beginning of life we should have the end in view.”</p>
<p>“Imitate647 the eunuch.648 He found one to teach him. He did not despise instruction.
The rich man made the poor man mount into his chariot. The illustrious and the great
welcomed the undistinguished and the small. When he had been taught the gospel of the
kingdom, he received the faith in his heart, and did not put off the seal of the Spirit.”</p>
<p>Homily XIV., against Drunkards, has the special interest of being originated by a painful
incident which it narrates. The circumstances may well be compared with those of the
scandal caused by the deacon Glycerius.649 Easter day, remarks St. Basil, is a day when decent
women ought to have been sitting in their homes, piously reflecting on future judgment.
Instead of this, certain wanton women, forgetful of the fear of God, flung their coverings
from their heads, despising God, and in contempt of His angels, lost to all shame before the
gaze of men, shaking their hair, trailing their tunics, sporting with their feet, with immodest
glances and unrestrained laughter, went off into a wild dance. They invited all the riotous
youth to follow them, and kept up their dances in the Basilica of the Martyrs’ before the
walls of Cæsarea, turning hallowed places into the workshop of their unseemliness. They
sang indecent songs, and befouled the ground with their unhallowed tread. They got a

crowd of lads to stare at them, and left no madness undone. On this St. Basil builds a stirring
temperance sermon. Section 6 contains a vivid picture of a drinking bout, and Section 7
describes the sequel. The details are evidently not imaginary.</p>
<p>“Sorrowful sight for Christian eyes! A man in the prime of life, of powerful frame of
high rank in the army, is carried furtively home, because he cannot stand upright, and travel
on his own feet. A man who ought to be a terror to our enemies is a laughing stock to the
lads in the streets. He is smitten down by no sword—slain by no foe. A military man, in
the bloom of manhood, the prey of wine, and ready to suffer any fate his foes may choose!
Drunkenness is the ruin of reason, the destruction of strength; it is untimely old age; it is,
for a short time, death.</p>
<p>“What are drunkards but the idols of the heathen? They have eyes and see not, ears and
hear not.650 Their hands are helpless; their feet dead.” The whole Homily is forcible. It is
quoted by Isidore of Pelusium,651 and St. Ambrose seems to have been acquainted with
it.652</p>
<p>Homily XX., on Humility, urges the folly of Adam, in sacrificing eternal blessings to
his ambition, and the example of St. Paul in glorying only in the Lord.653</p>
<p>Pharaoh, Goliath, and Abimelech are instanced. St. Peter is cited for lack of humility
in being sure that he of all men will be true to the death.</p>
<p>“No detail can be neglected654 as too insignificant to help us in ridding ourselves of
pride. The soul grows like its practices, and is formed and fashioned in accordance with its
conduct. Your appearance, your dress, your gait, your chair, your style of meals, your bed
and bedding, your house and its contents, should be all arranged with a view to cheapness.
Your talk, your songs, your mode of greeting your neighbour, should look rather to moderation
than to ostentation. Give me, I beg, no elaborate arguments in your talk, no surpassing
sweetness in your singing, no vaunting and wearisome discussions. In all things try to avoid
bigness. Be kind to your friend, gentle to your servant, patient with the impudent, amiable
to the lowly. Console the afflicted, visit the distressed, despise none. Be agreeable in address,
cheerful in reply, ready, accessible to all. Never sing your own praises, nor get other people
to sing them. Never allowing any uncivil communication, conceal as far as possible your
own superiority.”655</p>

<p>Homily XXI., on disregard of the things of this world, was preached out of St. Basil’s
diocese, very probably at Satala in 372.656 The second part657 is in reference to a fire which
occurred in the near neighbourhood of the church on the previous evening.</p>
<p>“Once more the fiend has shewn his fury against us, has armed himself with flame of
fire, and has attacked the precincts of the church. Once more our common mother has won
the day, and turned back his devices on himself. He has done nothing but advertise his
hatred.<gap reason="omitted"/>How do you not suppose the devil must be groaning to-day at the failure of his
projected attempt? Our enemy lighted his fire close to the church that he might wreck our
prosperity. The flames raised on every side by his furious blasts were streaming over all
they could reach; they fed on the air round about; they were being driven to touch the shrine,
and to involve us in the common ruin; but our Saviour turned them back on him who had
kindled them, and ordered his madness to fall on himself. The congregation who have
happily escaped are urged to live worthily of their preservation, shining like pure gold out
of the furnace.”</p>
<p>Homily XXII., which is of considerable interest, on the study of pagan literature, is really
not a homily at all.658 It is a short treatise addressed to the young on their education. It
would seem to have been written in the Archbishop’s later years, unless the experience of
which he speaks may refer rather to his earlier experience, alike as a student and a teacher.</p>
<p>No source of instruction can be overlooked in the preparation for the great battle of
life,659 and there is a certain advantage to be derived from the right use of heathen writers.
The illustrious Moses is described as training his intellect in the science of the Egyptians,
and so arriving at the contemplation of Him Who is.660 So in later days Daniel at Babylon
was wise in the Chaldean philosophy, and ultimately apprehended the divine instruction.
But granted that such heathen learning is not useless, the question remains how you are to
participate in it. To begin with the poets. Their utterances are of very various kinds, and
it will not be well to give attention to all without exception. When they narrate to you the
deeds and the words of good men, admire and copy them, and strive diligently to be like
them. When they come to bad men, shut your ears, and avoid imitating them, like Ulysses

fleeing from the sirens’ songs.661 Familiarity with evil words is a sure road to evil deeds,
wherefore every possible precaution must be taken to prevent our souls from unconsciously
imbibing evil influences through literary gratification, like men who take poison in honey.
We shall not therefore praise the poets when they revile and mock, or when they describe
licentious, intoxicated characters, when they define happiness as consisting in a laden table
and dissolute ditties. Least of all shall we attend to the poets when they are talking about
the gods, specially when their talk is of many gods, and those in mutual disagreement. For
among them brother is at variance with brother, parent against children, and children wage
a truceless war against parents. The gods’ adulteries and amours and unabashed embraces,
and specially those of Zeus, whom they describe as the chief and highest of them all,—things
which could not be told without a blush of brutes,—all this let us leave to actors on the
stage.662</p>
<p>I must make the same remark about historians, specially when they write merely to
please. And we certainly shall not follow rhetoricians in the art of lying.…I have been taught
by one well able to understand a poet’s mind that with Homer all his poetry is praise of
virtue, and that in him all that is not mere accessory tends to this end. A marked instance
of this is his description of the prince of the Kephallenians saved naked from shipwreck.
No sooner did he appear than the princess viewed him with reverence; so far was she from
feeling anything like shame at seeing him naked and alone, since his virtue stood him in the
stead of clothes.663 Afterwards he was of so much estimation among the rest of the Phæacians
that they abandoned the pleasures amid which they lived, all looked up to him and imitated
him, and not a man of the Phæacians prayed for anything more eagerly than that he might
be Ulysses,—a mere waif saved from shipwreck. Herein my friend said that he was the interpreter
of the poet’s mind; that Homer all but said aloud, Virtue, O men, is what you have
to care for. Virtue swims out with the shipwrecked sailor, and when he is cast naked on the
coast, virtue makes him more noble than the happy Phæacians. And truly this is so. Other
belongings are not more the property of their possessors than of any one else. They are like
dice flung hither and thither in a game. Virtue is the one possession which cannot be taken
away, and remains with us alike alive and dead.</p>

<p>Similar to these are the lines of Theognis,665 in which he says that God (whatever he
means by “God”) inclines the scale to men now one way and now another, and so at one
moment they are rich, and at another penniless. Somewhere too in his writings Prodicus,
the Sophist of Chios, has made similar reflexions on vice and virtue, to whom attention may
well be paid, for he is a man by no means to be despised. So far as I recollect his sentiments,
they are something to this effect. I do not remember the exact words, but the sense, in plain
prose, was as follows:666</p>
<p>Once upon a time, when Hercules was quite young, and of just about the same age as
yourselves, he was debating within himself which of the two ways he should choose, the one
leading through toil to virtue, the other which is the easiest of all. There approached him
two women. They were Virtue and Vice, and though they said not a word they straightway
shewed by their appearance what was the difference between them. One was tricked out to
present a fair appearance with every beautifying art. Pleasure and delights were shed around
her and she led close after her innumerable enjoyments like a swarm of bees. She showed
them to Hercules, and, promising him yet more and more, endeavoured to attract him to
her side. The other, all emaciated and squalid, looked earnestly at the lad, and spoke in
quite another tone. She promised him no ease, no pleasure, but toils, labours, and perils
without number, in every land and sea. She told him that the reward of all this would be
that he should become a god (so the narrator tells it). This latter Hercules followed even to
the death. Perhaps all those who have written anything about wisdom, less or more, each
according to his ability, have praised Virtue in their writings. These must be obeyed, and
the effort made to show forth their teaching in the conduct of life. For he alone is wise who

flit like shadows.667</p>
<p>It is as though some painter had represented a sitter as a marvel of manly beauty, and
then he were to be in reality what the artist had painted on the panel. But to utter glorious
eulogies on virtue in public, and make long speeches about it, while in private putting
pleasure before continence and giving gain higher honour than righteousness, is conduct
which seems to me illustrated by actors on the stage: they enter as monarchs and magnates,
when they are neither monarchs nor magnates, and perhaps even are only slaves. A singer
could never tolerate a lyre that did not match his voice, nor a coryphæus a chorus that did
not chant in tune. Yet every one will be inconsistent with himself, and will fail to make his
conduct agree with his words. The tongue has sworn, but the heart has never sworn, as
Euripedes668 has it; and a man will aim at seeming, rather than at being, good. Nevertheless,
if we may believe Plato, the last extreme of iniquity is for one to seem just without being
just.669 This then is the way in which we are to receive writings which contain suggestions
of good deeds. And since the noble deeds of men of old are preserved for our benefit either
by tradition, or in the works of poets and historians, do not let us miss the good we may get
from them. For instance: a man in the street once pursued Pericles with abuse, and persisted
in it all day. Pericles took not the slightest notice. Evening fell, and darkness came on, and
even then he could hardly be persuaded to give over. Pericles lighted him home, for fear
this exercise in philosophy might be lost.670 Again: once upon a time a fellow who was
angry with Euclid of Megara threatened him with death, and swore at him. Euclid swore
back that he would appease him, and calm him in spite of his rage.671 A man once attacked
Socrates the son of Sophoniscus and struck him again and again in the face. Socrates made
no resistance, but allowed the drunken fellow to take his fill of frenzy, so that his face was
all swollen and bloody from the blows. When the assault was done, Socrates, according to
the story, did nothing besides writing on his forehead, as a sculptor might on a statue, “This
is so and so’s doing.”672</p>

<p>This was his revenge. Where conduct, as in this case, is so much on a par with Christian
conduct,673 I maintain that it is well worth our while to copy these great men. The behaviour
of Socrates on this occasion is akin to the precept that we are by no means to take revenge,
but to turn the other cheek to the smiter. So the conduct of Pericles and Euclid matches
the commands to put up with persecutors, and to bear their wrath with meekness, and to
invoke not cursing but blessing on our enemies. He who has been previously instructed in
these examples will no longer regard the precepts as impracticable. I should like, too, to
instance the conduct of Alexander, when he had captured the daughters of Darius.674 Their
beauty is described as extraordinary, and Alexander would not so much as look at them,
for he thought it shameful that a conqueror of men should be vanquished by women. This
is of a piece with the statement that he who looks at a woman impurely, even though he do
not actually commit the act of adultery with her, is not free from guilt, because he has allowed
lust to enter his heart. Then there is the case of Clinias, the follower of Pythagoras: it is
difficult to believe this is a case of accidental, and not intentional, imitation of our principles.
675 What of him? He might have escaped a fine of three talents by taking an oath,
but he preferred to pay rather than swear, and this when he would have sworn truly. He
appears to me to have heard of the precept which orders us to swear not at all.676 To return
to the point with which I began. We must not take everything indiscriminately, but only
what is profitable. It would be shameful for us in the case of food to reject the injurious,
and at the same time, in the case of lessons, to take no account of what keeps the soul alive,
but, like mountain streams, to sweep in everything that happens to be in our way. The sailor
does not trust himself to the mercy of the winds, but steers his boat to the port; the archer
aims at his mark; the smith and the carpenter keep the end of the crafts in view. What sense
is there in our shewing ourselves inferior to these craftsmen, though we are quite able to
understand our own affairs? In mere handicrafts is there some object and end in labour,
and is there no aim in the life of man, to which any one ought to look who means to live a
life better than the brutes? Were no intelligence to be sitting at the tiller of our souls, we
should be dashed up and down in the voyage of life like boats that have no ballast. It is just
as with competitions in athletics, or, if you like, in music. In competitions mere crowns are
offered for prizes, there is always training, and no one in training for wrestling or the pan-

the Olympic games used to make chariots at full speed stand still, and so kept up his
strength.678 Milo, too, could not be pushed off his greased shield, but, pushed as he was,
held on as tightly as statues fastened by lead.679 In one word, training was the preparation
for these feats. Suppose they had neglected the dust and the gymnasia, and had given their
minds to the strains of Marsyas or Olympus, the Phrygians,680 they would never have won
crowns or glory, nor escaped ridicule for their bodily incapacity. On the other hand
Timotheus did not neglect harmony and spend his time in the wrestling schools. Had he
done so it would never have been his lot to surpass all the world in music, and to have attained
such extraordinary skill in his art as to be able to rouse the soul by his sustained and serious
melody, and then again relieve and sooth it by his softer strains at his good pleasure. By
this skill, when once he sang in Phrygian strains to Alexander, he is said to have roused the
king to arms in the middle of a banquet, and then by gentler music to have restored him to
his boon companions.681 So great is the importance, alike in music and in athletics, in view

<p>We must not be the slaves of our bodies, except where we are compelled. Our best
provision must be for the soul. We ought by means of philosophy to release her from fellowship
with all bodily appetites as we might from a dungeon, and at the same time make
our bodies superior to our appetites. We should, for instance, supply our bellies with necessaries,
not with dainties like men whose minds are set on cooks and table arrangers, and
who search through every land and sea, like the tributaries of some stern despot, much to
be pitied for their toil. Such men are really suffering pains as intolerable as the torments of
hell, carding into a fire,684 fetching water in a sieve, pouring into a tub with holes in it, and
getting nothing for their pains. To pay more than necessary attention to our hair and dress
is, as Diogenes phrases it, the part either of the unfortunate or of the wicked. To be finely
dressed, and to have the reputation of being so, is to my mind quite as disgraceful as to play
the harlot or to plot against a neighbour’s wedlock. What does it matter to a man with any
sense, whether he wears a grand state robe, or a common cloak, so long as it serves to keep
off heat and cold? In other matters necessity is to be the rule, and the body is only to be so
far regarded as is good for the soul.”</p>

Christianity. On her refusal to do this she was arraigned and burned. She is described as
having said that women no less than men were made after the image of God; that women

as flesh to make the woman, and that constancy, fortitude, and endurance are as womanly

<p>The homily, which recommends patience and cheerfulness in adversity, contains a
passage of great beauty upon prayer. “Ought we to pray without ceasing? Is it possible to
obey such a command? These are questions which I see you are ready to ask. I will endeavour,
to the best of my ability, to defend the charge. Prayer is a petition for good addressed
by the pious to God. But we do not rigidly confine our petition to words. Nor yet do we
imagine that God requires to be reminded by speech. He knows our needs even though we
ask Him not. What do I say then? I say that we must not think to make our prayer complete
by syllables. The strength of prayer lies rather in the purpose of our soul and in deeds of
virtue reaching every part and moment of our life. ‘Whether ye eat,’ it is said, ‘or drink, or
whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God.’686 As thou takest thy seat at table, pray. As thou
liftest the loaf, offer thanks to the Giver. When thou sustainest thy bodily weakness with
wine, remember Him Who supplies thee with this gift, to make thy heart glad and to comfort
thy infirmity. Has thy need for taking food passed away? Let not the thought of thy Benefactor
pass away too. As thou art putting on thy tunic, thank the Giver of it. As thou
wrappest thy cloak about thee, feel yet greater love to God, Who alike in summer and in
winter has given us coverings convenient for us, at once to preserve our life, and to cover
what is unseemly. Is the day done? Give thanks to Him Who has given us the sun for our
daily work, and has provided for us a fire to light up the night, and to serve the rest of the
needs of life. Let night give the other occasions of prayer. When thou lookest up to heaven
and gazest at the beauty of the stars, pray to the Lord of the visible world; pray to God the
Arch-artificer of the universe, Who in wisdom hath made them all. When thou seest all
nature sunk in sleep, then again worship Him Who gives us even against our wills release
from the continuous strain of toil, and by a short refreshment restores us once again to the
vigour of our strength. Let not night herself be all, as it were, the special and peculiar
property of sleep. Let not half thy life be useless through the senselessness of slumber. Divide
the time of night between sleep and prayer. Nay, let thy slumbers be themselves experiences
in piety; for it is only natural that our sleeping dreams should be for the most part echoes
of the anxieties of the day. As have been our conduct and pursuits, so will inevitably be our
dreams. Thus wilt thought pray without ceasing; if thought prayest not only in words, but
unitest thyself to God through all the course of life and so thy life be made one ceaseless and
uninterrupted prayer.”</p>

the weaker. The fire burned through the hand, but the hand was firm. The martyr might
say, “Thou hast holden me by my right hand. Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and
afterward receive me to glory.”688 The homily concludes with an apostrophe to the painters
of such scenes. “Up, I charge you, ye famous painters of the martyrs’ struggles! Adorn by
your art the mutilated figure of this officer of our army! I have made but a sorry picture of
the crowned hero. Use all your skill and all your colours in his honour.”</p>
<p>This was taken at the second Council of Nicæa as proof of an actual painting.689</p>
<p>Homily XVIII. is on the martyr Gordius, who was a native of Cæsarea, and was degraded
from his rank of centurion when Licinius removed Christians from the army. Gordius retired
into the wilderness, and led the life of an anchorite. One day there was a great festival at
Cæsarea in honour of Mars. There were to be races in the theatre, and thither the whole
population trooped. Not a Jew, not a heathen, was wanting. No small company of Christians
had joined the crowd, men of careless life, sitting in the assembly of folly, and not shunning
the counsel of the evil-doers, to see the speed of the horses and the skill of the charioteers.
Masters had given their slaves a holiday. Even boys ran from their schools to the show.
There was a multitude of common women of the lower ranks. The stadium was packed,
and every one was gazing intently on the races. Then that noble man, great of heart and
great of courage, came down from the uplands into the theatre. He took no thought of the
mob. He did not heed how many hostile hands he met.<gap reason="omitted"/>In a moment the whole theatre
turned to stare at the extraordinary sight. The man looked wild and savage. From his long
sojourn in the mountains his head was squalid, his beard long, his dress filthy. His body
was like a skeleton. He carried a stick and a wallet. Yet there was a certain grace about him,
shining from the unseen all around him. He was recognised. A great shout arose. Those
who shared his faith clapped for joy, but the enemies of the truth urged the magistrate to
put in force the penalty he had incurred, and condemned him beforehand to die. Then an
universal shouting arose all round. Nobody looked at the horses—nobody at the charioteers.
The exhibition of the chariots was mere idle noise. Not an eye but was wholly occupied
with looking at Gordius, not an ear wanted to hear anything but his words. Then a confused
murmur, running like a wind through all the theatre, sounded above the din of the course.
Heralds were told to proclaim silence. The pipes were hushed, and all the band stopped in
a moment. Gordius was being listened to; Gordius was the centre of all eyes, and in a moment
he was dragged before the magistrate who presided over the games. With a mild and gentle
voice the magistrate asked him his name, and whence he came. He told his country, his
family, the rank he had held, the reason for his flight, and his return. “Here I am,” he cried;
“ready to testify by creed to the contempt in which I hold your orders, and my faith in the

God in whom I have trusted. For I have heard that you are inferior to few in cruelty. This
is why I have chosen this time in order to carry out my wishes.” With these words he kindled
the wrath of the governor like a fire, and roused all his fury against himself. The order was
given, “Call the lictors; where are the plates of lead? Where are the scourges? Let him be
stretched upon a wheel; let him be wrenched upon the rack; let the instruments of torture
be brought in; make ready the beasts, the fire, the sword, the cross. What a good thing for
the villain that he can die only once!”690 “Nay,” replied Gordius. “What a bad thing for
me that I cannot die for Christ again and again!”<gap reason="omitted"/></p>
<p>All the town crowded to the spot where the martyrdom was to be consummated. Gordius
uttered his last words. Death is the common lot of man. As we must all die, let us
through death win life. Make the necessary voluntary. Exchange the earthly for the heavenly.
He then crossed himself, he stepped forward for the fatal blow, without changing colour or
losing his cheerful mien. It seemed as though he were not going to meet an executioner,
but to yield himself into the hands of angels.691</p>
<p>Homily XIX. is on the Forty Soldier Martyrs of Sebaste, who were ordered by the officers
of Licinius, a.d. 320, to offer sacrifice to the heathen idols, and, at their refusal, were plunged
for a whole night into a frozen pond in the city, in sight of a hot bath on the brink. One
man’s faith and fortitude failed him. He rushed to the relief of the shore, plunged into the
hot water, and died on the spot. One of the executioners had stood warming himself and
watching the strange scene. He had seemed to see angels coming down from heaven and
distributing gifts to all the band but one. When the sacred number of forty was for the
moment broken the officer flung off his clothes, and sprang into the freezing pond with the
cry, “I am a Christian.” Judas departed. Matthias took his place.<gap reason="omitted"/></p>

health if he be sick. Let your supplications be made with the martyrs. Let young men imitate
their fellows. Let fathers pray to be fathers of like sons. Let mothers learn from a good
mother. The mother of one of these saints saw the rest overcome by the cold, and her son,
from his strength or his constancy, yet alive. The executioners had left him, on the chance
of his having changed his mind. She herself lifted him in her arms, and placed him on the
car in which the rest were being drawn to the pyre, a veritable martyr’s mother.692</p>
<note type="footnote">692 The name of this youngest of the Forty is given as Melito (D.C.B. s.v.). They are commemorated on
March 9 in the Roman Kalendar of Gregory XIII. and the Menology of Basil; on March 10 in the Roman Mart.
of Bened. XIV.; on the 11th in the old Roman Kal., and on March 16 in the Armenian. The legend of the discovery
of some of their relics is given in Sozomen ix. 2. Others were obtained for the church built in their honour at
Annesi. (cf. p. xiv.) Two doctrinal points come out in this homily, (a) The officer who took the place of Melito
is said to have been baptized, not in water but in his own blood (§ 7). Here is martyrdom represented as the
equivalent of baptism. (b) The stage arrived at in the progress of Christian sentiment towards the invocation
of departed saints is indicated. Garnier, the Jesuit, writes in the margin of the passage quoted above, Invocantur
martyres; and Ceillier notes, Il reconnait que les prieres des martyrs peuvent beaucoup nous aider auprés de Dieu.
But in this particular passage the idea of “fleeing to the Forty” seems to be not fleeing to them to ask for their
prayers, but fleeing to the shrine to pray in company with them. It is rather the fellowship than the intercession
of the saints which is sought. μετὰ μαρτύρων γιγνέσθω τὰ αἰτήματα ὑμῶν. Let your requests be made not to
but with the martyrs. In the Homily on St. Mamas, the next in order, the expressions are less equivocal. At the
same time it must be remarked that with St. Basil the invocation and the intercession are local. In the De Sp.
Scto. (chap. xxiii. p. 34) a significant contrast is drawn between the ubiquity of the Holy Ghost and the limited
and local action of angels. And if of angels, so of saints. The saints who have departed this life are thought of
as accessible at the shrines where their relics rest, but, if we apply the analogy of the De Sp. Scto., not everywhere.
It has been said that this is the period when requests for the prayers of the holy dead begin to appear, and
Archbishop Ussher (Address to a Jesuit, chap. ix.) cites Gregory of Nazianzus for the earliest instance within his
knowledge of a plain invocation of the departed. But, as bishop Harold Browne points out, his invocation is
rather rhetorical than supplicatory. Gregory “had even a pious persuasion that they still continued as much as
ever to aid with their prayers those for whom they had been wont to pray on earth (Orat. xxiv. p. 425). And he
ventures to think if it be not too bold to say so (εἰ μὴ τολυηρὸν τοῦτο εἰπεῖν), that the saints, being nearer to
God and having put off the fetters of the flesh, have more avail with Him than when on earth (Orat. xix. p. 228).
In all these he does not appear to have gone further than some who preceded him, nor is there anything in such
speculations beyond what might be consistent with the most Protestant abhorrence of saint worship and Mariolatry”
(Bp. Harold Browne in Art. xxii.). Romish authorities in support of a yet earlier development, point to
Irenæus (Adv. Hær. v. 19), wherein a highly rhetorical passage the Virgin Mary is said to have become the “advocate”
of the Virgin Eve, and to Origen, who “invoked” his guardian angel (Hom. i. in Ezek. 7). The later
mediæval invocation Bp. Jeremy Taylor (vol. vi. Eden’s ed. p. 489) ingeniously shews to be of a piece rather with
early heresy than with early Catholicity: “It pretends to know their present state, which is hid from our eyes;
and it proceeds upon the very reason upon which the Gnostics and Valentinians went; that is, that it is fit to</note>

<p>The last of the Panegyrical Homilies (XXIII.) is on Saint Mamas, commemorated on
September 2 by the Greeks, and on August 17 by the Latins. He is said to have been a
shepherd martyred at Cæsarea in 274 in the persecution of Aurelian. Sozomen (v. 2) relates
that when the young princes Julian and Gallus were at the castle of Macellum693 they were
engaged in building a church in the martyr’s honour, and that Julian’s share in the work
never prospered.694 The homily narrates no details concerning the saint, and none seem
to be known. It does contain a more direct mention of a practice of invocation. There is a
charge to all who have enjoyed the martyr in dreams to remember him; to all who have met
with him in the church, and have found him a helper in their prayers; to all those whom he
has aided in their doings, when called on by name.695 The conclusion contains a summary
of the Catholic doctrine concerning the Son. “You have been told before, and now you are
being told again, ‘In the beginning was the Word,’696 to prevent your supposing that the
Son was a being generated after the manner of men,697 from His having come forth out of
the non-existent. ‘Word’ is said to you, because of His impassibility. ‘Was’ is said because
of His being beyond time. He says ‘beginning’ to conjoin the Begotten with His Father.
You have seen how the obedient sheep hears a master’s voice. ‘In the beginning,’ and ‘was,’
and ‘Word.’ Do not go on to say, ‘How was He?’ and ‘If He was, He was not begotten;’ and
‘If He was begotten, He was not.’ It is not a sheep who says these things. The skin is a
sheep’s; but the speaker within is a wolf. Let him be recognised as an enemy. ‘My sheep
hear my voice.’698 You have heard the Son. Understand His likeness to His Father. I say
likeness because of the weakness of the stronger bodies: In truth, and I am not afraid of
approaching the truth, I am no ready deceiver: I say identity, always preserving the distinct
existence of Son and Father. In the hypostasis of Son understand the Father’s Form, that
you may hold the exact doctrine of this Image,—that you may understand consistently with
true religion the words, ‘I am in the Father and the Father in me.’699 Understand not confusion
of essences, but identity of characters.”</p>

<head>VI.—Liturgical.</head>
<p>It is beyond the scope of the present work to discuss at length the history and relation
of the extant Liturgies, which go by the name of St. Basil. St. Basil’s precise share in their
composition, as we possess them, must be conjectural.</p>
<p>(i) The Liturgy, which St. Basil himself used and gave to his clergy and monks, preserved
the traditional form in use in the archdiocese of Cæsarea.700 It is mentioned in the xxxiind
canon of the council “in Trullo” of 692. This is no doubt the basis of the Greek Liturgy
known as St. Basil’s, and used in the East as well as the Liturgy of St. Chrysostom. The form
in use is contained in Neale’s Primitive Liturgies (1875). Dr. Swainson (Greek Liturgies
chiefly from Oriental Sources, p. 75) printed an edition of it from the Barberini ms. in 1884.</p>
<p>(ii) There is an Alexandrine Liturgy in Coptic, Arabic, and Greek form, called St. Basil’s,
and used on fast days by the Monophysites (Renaudot, Lit. Orient. Collectio, i. 154). This
differs entirely from the first named.</p>
<p>(iii) Yet again there is a Syriac Liturgy called St. Basil’s, translated by Masius, and given
by Renaudot in his second volume.701</p>
<note type="footnote">700 cf. De Sp. Scto. chap. xxvii. p. 41.</note>
<note type="footnote">701 cf. Dict. Christ. Ant. s.v. “Liturgy,” and C. Hole, Manual of the Book of Common Prayer, chap. ii. Fessler
notes: “Extat Liturgia S. Basilii tam fusior quam brevior gr. et lat. in Eucholog. Gr. ed. J. Goar Venetiis 1730 et
alia gr. et lat. in E. Renaudot Coll. Lit. Or. Paris, 1716, item alia latine tantum conversa ex Coptico Jacobitarum
in eadem collect, ac rursus alia latine tantum ex Syriaco conversa.…De formæ varietate hæc optime monet
Renaudot: ‘Liturgia illa, quod extra dubium est, usurpatur in Græca ecclesia ab annis plus mille ducentis; atque
inde originem habuerunt leves aliquot discrepantiæ in precibus præparatoriis aut in aliis orationibus. Quædam
exemplaria cæremoniales rubricas habent, quæ in aliis non reperiuntur; at alicujus momenti discrimen in illis
partibus quæ canonem sacræ Actionis constituunt, non reperitur.…Varietates in codicibus omnes prope ad ritus
spectant, qui enucleatius in aliquibus, in aliis brevius explicantur, in nonnullis omittuntur, quia aliunde peti debebant.’
Eo autem sensu Liturgiæ hujus auctor dicitur Basilius, non quod proprio ingenio eam excogitaverit, sed
quod preces publicas, eisque contiguos ritus, quoad rei essentiam ex communi traditionis Apostolicæ fonte manantes,
ordinaverit et in scriptis codicibus ad certam formam redegerit.”</note>

<head>IX.—Additional Notes on Some Points in St. Basil’s Doctrinal and Ecclesiastical
Position.</head>
<p>It has been claimed with reason that the doctrinal standpoint of St. Basil is identical
with that of the English Church, with the one exception of the veneration of relics and the
invocation of saints.702</p>
<p>In confirmation of this view, the following points may be noted:</p>
<p>1. The Holy Eucharist. The remarkable passage on the spiritual manducation of the
elements in Letter VIII. is commented on on p. 118. His custom as to frequent communion
and his opinion as to the reserved sacrament are remarked on on p. 179.</p>
<p>A significant passage is to be found in the Moralia, Rule XXI., that participation in the
Body and Blood of Christ is necessary to eternal life. John vi. 54, is then quoted. That no
benefit is derived by him who comes to communion without consideration of the method
whereby participation of the Body and Blood of Christ is given; and that he who receives
unworthily is condemned. On this John vi. 54 and 62, and 1 Cor. xiii. 27, are quoted. By
what method (ποίU+0026 251· λόγῳ) we must eat the Body and drink the Blood of the Lord, in
remembrance of the Lord’s obedience unto death, that they who live may no longer live
unto themselves, but to Him who died and rose again for them. In answer, the quotations
are Luke xxii. 29, 1 Cor. xi. 23, 2 Cor. v. 14, and 1 Cor. x. 16.</p>
<p>2. Mariolatry. Even Letter CCCLX., which bears obvious marks of spuriousness, and
of proceeding from a later age, does not go beyond a recognition of the Blessed Virgin as
Θεοτόκος, in which the Catholic Church is agreed, and a general invocation of apostles,
prophets, and martyrs, the Virgin not being set above these. The argument of Letter CCLXI.
(p. 300) that “if the Godbearing flesh was not ordained to be assumed of the lump of Adam,
what need was there of the Blessed Virgin?” seems quite inconsistent with the modern
doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. Of any cultus of the Virgin, St. Basil’s writings
shew no trace.</p>
<p>3. Relations to the Roman Church.</p>
<p>In order to say something under this head, Ceillier, the Benedictine, is driven to such
straits as to quote the application of the term “Coryphæus” to Damasus in Letter CCXXXIX.
Certainly St. Basil saw no reason to congratulate the Westerns on their “Coryphæus,” so far
as intelligent interest in the East was involved. Fialon703 sees the position more clearly, so
far as Basil is concerned, though he assumes the Councils to have given more authority to
the patriarch of the ancient capital than was in fact conceded. “Si Basile ne va pas, comme
la majorité du Concile de Constantinople, jusqu’à traiter l’Occident comne étranger; s’il ne
pretend pas que 1’empire appartienne à l’Orient, parce que l’Orient voit naitre le Soleil, et que

<pb n="131"/>
c’est en Orient que Dieu brilla dans une enveloppe charnelle,704ne voudrait il pas, dans l’ordre
religieux, l’union indepéndante, qui, depuis Constantin, rattache, dans l’ordre politique, ces
deux parties du monde Romain? À ses yeux l’Orient et l’Occident ne sont ils pas deux freres,
dont les droit sont égaux, sans suprématie, sans ainesse?”</p>
<p>In truth Basil appealed to Damasus as Theodoret to Leo, and as Chrysostom to Innocent,
not as vassal to liege lord, but as brother to brother. In Basil’s case, even the brotherhood
was barely recognised, if recognised at all, by the western prelate.</p>

<head>X.—Editions and Manuscripts.</head>
<p>Among the chief editions and mss. the following may be mentioned:</p>
<p>The Editio Princeps of the complete extant works of Basil in the original Greek is that
which Froben published for Janus Cornarius at Bale in 1551. But Froben had already published
in 1532, under the editorship of Erasmus, an edition containing the De Spiritu Sancto,
the Hexæmeron, the Homilies on the Psalms, twenty-nine different Homilies and some Letters.</p>
<p>A Venetian edition, published by Fabius in 1535, comprised the Moralia, as well as the
dubious book on Virginity, three books against Eunomius, and the tract against the Sabellians,
Arians, and Anomoeans.</p>
<p>The Greek editions had been preceded by a Latin version at Rome, by Raphael Volaterranus
in 1515, of which the autograph manuscript is in the British Museum, and by another
at Paris in 1525, and by a third Latin edition issued at Cologne in 1531. These were followed
by other editions printed at Paris, Antwerp, and Cologne. In 1618 Fronton du Duc, commonly
known as Ducæus, published, in conjunction with Frederic Morel, an edition in two
folio volumes containing a Latin version as well as the Greek. The edition of the French
Dominican Father Francis Combefis, was published shortly after his death in 1679. The
most important step in the direction of accuracy and completeness was taken by Julian
Garnier, a Benedictine Father of the Congregation of St. Maur. He revised and corrected
the Greek text of earlier editions on the authority of a number of manuscripts in Paris, Italy,
and England, and issued the first of his three folio volumes at Paris, at the press of John
Baptist Coignard, in 1721. The third volume did not appear till 1730, five years after
Garnier’s death. In the meanwhile the editorial work had been taken up by Prudent Maran,
another Benedictine, to whom are due a careful and voluminous biographical notice, many
notes, and a chronological arrangement of the Letters. This was reissued in three 4° volumes
in Paris in 1889, and is the basis of the edition published, with additions, by the Abbé Jacques
Paul Migne, in the Patrologia Græca, in 1857.</p>
<p>An important edition of a separate work is the revised text, with notes and introduction,
of the De Spiritu Sancto, by the Rev. C. F. H. Johnston, published at the Clarendon Press in
1892.</p>
<p>German translations were published by Count Schweikhard at Ingolstadt in 1591
(Ceillier VI. viii. 8), and by J. von Wendel at Vienna in 1776–78. There have also been issued
Basilius des Grossen auserlesenes Homilien, übersetzt und mit Ammerkungen versehen von
J. G. Krabinger, Landshut, 1839, and Auserlesene Schriften, übersetzt von Gröne, Kempten,
1875.</p>
<p>Homilies and Orations were published in Italian in 1711 by Gio. Maria Lucchini. Omelie
Scelte, translated by A. M. Ricci, were published in Florence in 1732.
Many important extracts are translated into French in the Historie Générale des Auteurs
Sacrés of the Benedictine Remy Ceillier (Paris, 1737).</p>

<pb n="133"/>
<p>E. Fialon, in his Ét. Hist. (1869) has translated the Ηεξͅμερον; and in 1889 the Panégyrique
due Martyr Gordius was published in French by J. Genouille.</p>
<p>A complete account of the bibliography of St. Basil is given in the Notitia ex Bibliotheca
Fabricii (Ed. Harles, tom. ix. 1804), in Migne’s ed. vol. i., Prolegomena p. ccxli.</p>
<p>In 1888 a translation of the De Spiritu Sancto, by G. Lewis, was included in the Christian
Classic Series.</p>
<p>Of all the smaller works a great popularity, as far as popularity can be gauged by the
number of editions and translations, has belonged to the Advice to the Young and the Homily
on the Forty Martyrs.</p>
<p>The mss. collated by the Ben. Edd. for their edition of the De Spiritu Sancto are five entitled
Regii, and a sixth known as Colbertinus, now in the national library at Paris. The Ben.
Regius Secundus (2293) is described by Omont (Inventaire Sommaire des mss. Grecs) as of
the Xth c., the Colbertinus (4529) and the Regius Tertius(2893) as of the XIth c., and the Regius
Primus (2286), Regius Quartus (2896), Regius Quintus(3430) as of the XIVth c.</p>
<p>For his edition, Mr. C. F. H. Johnston also collated or had collated 22,509 Add. mss.,
Xth c., in the British Museum; codd. Misc. xxxvii., XIth c., in the Bodleian Library at Oxford;
Cod. Theol. 142, XIIth c., in the Imperial Library at Vienna; Cod. Theol. 18, XIVth c., also
at Vienna; Cod. xxiii, XIth c., in the Library of the Holy Synod at Moscow; 500 (Reg. 1824,
3) G, XIth c., at Paris; Cod. lviii., Xth c., at St. Mark’s, Venice; Cod. lxvi., XIIth c., also at St.
Mark’s, Venice; Codd. Regin. Suaecor. 35, XIVth c., in the Vatican at Rome.</p>
<p>For the Hexæmeron the Ben. Edd. used eight mss. styled Regii, and numbered respectively
1824, 2286 (originally in the collection of Henry II. at Fontainebleau, the Regius Primus of
the enumeration for the De Spiritu Sancto, but the Secundus for that of the Hexæmeron),
2287 (1°), 2287 (2°), 2349, 2892, 2896 (the Regius Quartus of the De Spiritu Sancto), and
2989, two mss. entitled Colbertinus, 3069 and 4721, two Coistiniani, 229, IXth c., and 235;
and a ms. in the Bodleian, “a doctissimo viro Joanne Wolf collatus.”</p>
<p>The sources of the Ben. Ed. of the Letters were Coislinianus 237, XIth c., a Codex
Harlæanus of the Xth or XIth c., and a Codex Medicæus, Codex Regius 2293, Codex Regius

<head>ΤΟΥ ΑΓΙΟΥ ΒΑΧΙΛΕΙΟΥ ΠΕΡΙ ΤΟΥ ΠΝΕΥΜΑΤΟΧ ΒΙΒΛΙΟΝ.
THE BOOK OF SAINT BASIL ON THE SPIRIT.
DE SPIRITU SANCTO.</head>
<head>Preface.</head>
<p>The heresy of Arius lowered the dignity of the Holy Ghost as well as that of the Son.
He taught that the Three Persons of the Holy Trinity are wholly unlike one another both in
essence and in glory. “There is a triad, not in equal glories;” “one more glorious than the
other in their glories to an infinite degree.” So says the Thalia, quoted in Ath. de Syn. § 15.
But the Nicene definition, while it was precise in regard to the Son, left the doctrine of the
Holy Ghost comparatively open, (Πιστεύομεν εἰς τὸ ῞Αγιον Πνεῦμα,) not from hesitation
or doubt, but because this side of Arian speculation was not prominent. (Cf. Basil, Letters
cxxv. and ccxxvi. and Dr. Swete in D.C.B. iii. 121.) It was the expulsion of Macedonius from
the see of Constantinople in 360 which brought “Macedonianism” to a head. He was put
there by Arians as an Arian. Theodoret (Ecc. Hist. ii. 5) explains how disagreement arose.
He was an upholder, if not the author, of the watchword ὁμοιούσιον (Soc. ii. 45) (but many
supporters of the ὁμοιούσιον (e.g., Eustathius of Sebasteia) shrank from calling the Holy
Ghost a creature. So the Pneumatomachi began to be clearly marked off. The various creeds
of the Arians and semi-Arians did not directly attack the Godhead of the Holy Ghost, though
they did not accept the doctrine of the essential unity of the Three Persons. (Cf. Hahn,
Bibliothek der Symbole, pp. 148–174, quoted by Swete.) But their individual teaching went
far beyond their confessions. The Catholic theologians were roused to the danger, and on
the return of Athanasius from his third exile, a council was held at Alexandria which resulted
in the first formal ecclesiastical condemnation of the depravers of the Holy Ghost, in the
Tomus ad Antiochenos (q.v. with the preface on p. 481 of Ath. in the edition of this series.
Cf. also Ath. ad Serap. i. 2, 10). In the next ten years the Pneumatomachi, Macedonians, or
Marathonians, so called from Marathonius, bishop of Nicomedia, whose support to the
party was perhaps rather pecuniary than intellectual (Nicephorus H.E. ix. 47), made head,
and were largely identified with the Homoiousians. In 374 was published the Ancoratus of
St. Epiphanius, bishop of Salamis in Cyprus, written in 373, and containing two creeds (vide
Heurtley de F. et Symb. pp. 14–18), the former of which is nearly identical with the Confes-

sion of Constantinople. It expresses belief in τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ ῞Αγιον, Κύριον, καὶ Ζωοποιὸν,
τὸ ἐκ τοῦ Πατρὸς ἐκπορευόμενον, τὸ σὺν Πατρὶ καὶ ΥἱU+0026 254· συμπροσκυνοί μενον καὶ
συνδοξαζόμενον, τὸ λαλῆσαν διὰ τῶν προφητῶν. It is in this same year, 374, that Amphilochius,
the first cousin of Gregory of Nazianzus and friend and spiritual son of Basil,
paid the first of his annual autumn visits to Cæsarea (Bishop Lightfoot, D.C.B. i. 105) and
there urged St. Basil to clear up all doubt as to the true doctrine of the Holy Spirit by writing
a treatise on the subject. St. Basil complied, and, on the completion of the work, had it engrossed
on parchment (Letter ccxxxi.) and sent it to Amphilochius, to whom he dedicated
it.</p>

<head>Chapter I.</head>
<p>Prefatory remarks on the need of exact investigation of the most minute portions of theology.</p>
<p>1. Your desire for information, my right well-beloved and most deeply respected
brother Amphilochius, I highly commend, and not less your industrious energy. I have
been exceedingly delighted at the care and watchfulness shewn in the expression of your
opinion that of all the terms concerning God in every mode of speech, not one ought to be
left without exact investigation. You have turned to good account your reading of the exhortation
of the Lord, “Every one that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth,”705 and
by your diligence in asking might, I ween, stir even the most reluctant to give you a share
of what they possess. And this in you yet further moves my admiration, that you do not,
according to the manners of the most part of the men of our time, propose your questions
by way of mere test, but with the honest desire to arrive at the actual truth. There is no lack
in these days of captious listeners and questioners; but to find a character desirous of information,
and seeking the truth as a remedy for ignorance, is very difficult. Just as in the hunter’s
snare, or in the soldier’s ambush, the trick is generally ingeniously concealed, so it is with
the inquiries of the majority of the questioners who advance arguments, not so much with
the view of getting any good out of them, as in order that, in the event of their failing to
elicit answers which chime in with their own desires, they may seem to have fair ground for
controversy.</p>
<p>2. If “To the fool on his asking for wisdom, wisdom shall be reckoned,”706 at how high
a price shall we value “the wise hearer” who is quoted by the Prophet in the same verse with
“the admirable counsellor”?707 It is right, I ween, to hold him worthy of all approbation,
and to urge him on to further progress, sharing his enthusiasm, and in all things toiling at
his side as he presses onwards to perfection. To count the terms used in theology as of
primary importance, and to endeavour to trace out the hidden meaning in every phrase and
in every syllable, is a characteristic wanting in those who are idle in the pursuit of true religion,
but distinguishing all who get knowledge of “the mark” “of our calling;”708 for what
is set before us is, so far as is possible with human nature, to be made like unto God. Now
without knowledge there can be no making like; and knowledge is not got without lessons.
The beginning of teaching is speech, and syllables and words are parts of speech. It follows
then that to investigate syllables is not to shoot wide of the mark, nor, because the questions
raised are what might seem to some insignificant, are they on that account to be held un-

worthy of heed. Truth is always a quarry hard to hunt, and therefore we must look everywhere
for its tracks. The acquisition of true religion is just like that of crafts; both grow bit
by bit; apprentices must despise nothing. If a man despise the first elements as small and
insignificant, he will never reach the perfection of wisdom.</p>
<p>Yea and Nay are but two syllables, yet there is often involved in these little words at
once the best of all good things, Truth, and that beyond which wickedness cannot go, a Lie.
But why mention Yea and Nay? Before now, a martyr bearing witness for Christ has been
judged to have paid in full the claim of true religion by merely nodding his head.709 If, then,
this be so, what term in theology is so small but that the effect of its weight in the scales according
as it be rightly or wrongly used is not great? Of the law we are told “not one jot nor
one tittle shall pass away;”710 how then could it be safe for us to leave even the least unnoticed?
The very points which you yourself have sought to have thoroughly sifted by us
are at the same time both small and great. Their use is the matter of a moment, and peradventure
they are therefore made of small account; but, when we reckon the force of their
meaning, they are great. They may be likened to the mustard plant which, though it be the
least of shrub-seeds, yet when properly cultivated and the forces latent in its germs unfolded,
rises to its own sufficient height.</p>
<p>If any one laughs when he sees our subtilty, to use the Psalmist’s711 words, about syllables,
let him know that he reaps laughter’s fruitless fruit; and let us, neither giving in to men’s
reproaches, nor yet vanquished by their disparagement, continue our investigation. So far,
indeed, am I from feeling ashamed of these things because they are small, that, even if I
could attain to ever so minute a fraction of their dignity, I should both congratulate myself
on having won high honour, and should tell my brother and fellow-investigator that no
small gain had accrued to him therefrom.</p>
<p>While, then, I am aware that the controversy contained in little words is a very great
one, in hope of the prize I do not shrink from toil, with the conviction that the discussion
will both prove profitable to myself, and that my hearers will be rewarded with no small
benefit. Wherefore now with the help, if I may so say, of the Holy Spirit Himself, I will ap-

missed the force of the original, both grammatically and historically, in referring it to the time when St. Basil is
writing; ἤδη ἐκρίθη does not mean “at the present day is judged,” but “ere now has been judged.” And in a.d.
374 there was no persecution of Christians such as seems to be referred to, although Valens tried to crush the
Catholics.</note>

proach the exposition of the subject, and, if you will, that I may be put in the way of the
discussion, I will for a moment revert to the origin of the question before us.</p>
<p>3. Lately when praying with the people, and using the full doxology to God the Father
in both forms, at one time “with the Son together with the Holy Ghost,” and at another
“through the Son in the Holy Ghost,” I was attacked by some of those present on the ground
that I was introducing novel and at the same time mutually contradictory terms.712 You,
however, chiefly with the view of benefiting them, or, if they are wholly incurable, for the
security of such as may fall in with them, have expressed the opinion that some clear instruction
ought to be published concerning the force underlying the syllables employed. I will
therefore write as concisely as possible, in the endeavour to lay down some admitted principle
for the discussion.</p>
<note type="footnote">712 It is impossible to convey in English the precise force of the prepositions used. “With” represents μετά,
of which the original meaning is “amid;” “together with,” σύν, of which the original meaning is “at the same
time as.” The Latin of the Benedictine edition translates the first by “cum,” and the second by “una cum.”
“Through” stands for διά, which, with the genitive, is used of the instrument; “in” for ε'ν, “in,” but also commonly
used of the instrument or means. In the well known passage in 1 Cor. viii. 6, A.V. renders δι᾽ οὗ τὰ πάντα by​ “through whom are all things;” R.V., by “by whom.”</note>

<p>The origin of the heretics’ close observation of syllables.</p>
<p>4. The petty exactitude of these men about syllables and words is not, as might be supposed,
simple and straightforward; nor is the mischief to which it tends a small one. There
is involved a deep and covert design against true religion. Their pertinacious contention is
to show that the mention of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost is unlike, as though they will thence
find it easy to demonstrate that there is a variation in nature. They have an old sophism,
invented by Aetius, the champion of this heresy, in one of whose Letters there is a passage
to the effect that things naturally unlike are expressed in unlike terms, and, conversely, that
things expressed in unlike terms are naturally unlike. In proof of this statement he drags
in the words of the Apostle, “One God and Father of whom are all things,<gap reason="omitted"/>and one Lord
Jesus Christ by whom are all things.”713 “Whatever, then,” he goes on, “is the relation of
these terms to one another, such will be the relation of the natures indicated by them; and
as the term ‘of whom’ is unlike the term ‘by whom,’ so is the Father unlike the Son.”714 On
<note type="footnote">713 1 Cor. viii. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">714 The story as told by Theodoret (Ecc. Hist. ii. 23) is as follows: “Constantius, on his return from the west,
passed some time at Constantinople” (i.e. in 360, when the synod at Constantinople was held, shortly after that
of the Isaurian Seleucia, “substance” and “hypostasis” being declared inadmissible terms, and the Son pronounced
like the Father according to the Scriptures). The Emperor was urged that “Eudoxius should be convicted of
blasphemy and lawlessness. Constantius however…replied that a decision must first be come to on matters
concerning the faith, and that afterwards the case of Eudoxius should be enquired into. Basilius (of Ancyra),
relying on his former intimacy, ventured boldly to object to the Emperor that he was attacking the apostolic
decrees; but Constantius took this ill, and told Basilius to hold his tongue, for to you, said he, the disturbance
of the churches is due. When Basilius was silenced, Eustathius (of Sebasteia) intervened and said, Since, sir, you
wish a decision to be come to on what concerns the faith, consider the blasphemies uttered against the Only
Begotten by Eudoxius; and, as he spoke, he produced the exposition of faith, wherein, besides many other impieties,
were found the following expressions: Things that are spoken of in unlike terms are unlike in substance;
there is one God the Father of Whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are all things. Now
the term ‘of Whom’ is unlike the term ‘by Whom;’ so the Son is unlike God the Father. Constantius ordered
this exposition of the faith to be read, and was displeased with the blasphemy which it involved. He therefore
asked Eudoxius if he had drawn it up. Eudoxius instantly repudiated the authorship, and said that it was written
by Aetius. Now Aetius…at the present time was associated with Eunomius and Eudoxius, and, as he found
Eudoxius to be, like himself, a sybarite in luxury as well as a heretic in faith, he chose Antioch as the most congenial
place of abode, and both he and Eunomius were fast fixtures at the couches of Eudoxius.…The Emperor
had been told all this, and now ordered Aetius to be brought before him. On his appearance, Constantius shewed
him the document in question, and proceeded to enquire if he was the author of its language. Aetius, totally
ignorant of what had taken place, and unaware of the drift of the enquiry, expected that he should win praise</note>

<pb n="144"/>
this heresy depends the idle subtilty of these men about the phrases in question. They accordingly
assign to God the Father, as though it were His distinctive portion and lot, the
phrase “of Whom;” to God the Son they confine the phrase “by Whom;” to the Holy Spirit
that of “in Whom,” and say that this use of the syllables is never interchanged, in order that,
as I have already said, the variation of language may indicate the variation of nature.715
Verily it is sufficiently obvious that in their quibbling about the words they are endeavouring
to maintain the force of their impious argument.</p>
<p>By the term “of whom” they wish to indicate the Creator; by the term “through whom,”
the subordinate agent716 or instrument;717 by the term “in whom,” or “in which,” they mean
to shew the time or place. The object of all this is that the Creator of the universe718 may
be regarded as of no higher dignity than an instrument, and that the Holy Spirit may appear
to be adding to existing things nothing more than the contribution derived from place or
time.</p>
<note type="footnote">by confession, and owned that he was the author of the phrases in question. Then the Emperor perceived the
greatness of his iniquity, and forthwith condemned him to exile and to be deported to a place in Phrygia.” St.
Basil accompanied Eustathius and his namesake to Constantinople on this occasion, being then only in deacon’s
orders. (Philost. iv. 12.) Basil of Ancyra and Eustathius in their turn suffered banishment. Basil, the deacon,
returned to the Cappadocian Cæsarea.</note>

<head>Chapter III.</head>
<p>The systematic discussion of syllables is derived from heathen philosophy.</p>
<p>5. They have, however, been led into this error by their close study of heathen writers,
who have respectively applied the terms “of whom” and “through whom” to things which
are by nature distinct. These writers suppose that by the term “of whom” or “of which” the
matter is indicated, while the term “through whom” or “through which”719 represents the
instrument, or, generally speaking, subordinate agency.720 Or rather—for there seems no
reason why we should not take up their whole argument, and briefly expose at once its incompatibility
with the truth and its inconsistency with their own teaching—the students of
vain philosophy, while expounding the manifold nature of cause and distinguishing its peculiar
significations, define some causes as principal,721 some as cooperative or con-causal,
while others are of the character of “sine qua non,” or indispensable.722</p>
<p>For every one of these they have a distinct and peculiar use of terms, so that the maker
is indicated in a different way from the instrument. For the maker they think the proper
expression is “by whom,” maintaining that the bench is produced “by” the carpenter; and
for the instrument “through which,” in that it is produced “through” or by means of adze
and gimlet and the rest. Similarly they appropriate “of which” to the material, in that the
thing made is “of” wood, while “according to which” shews the design, or pattern put before
the craftsman. For he either first makes a mental sketch, and so brings his fancy to bear
upon what he is about, or else he looks at a pattern previously put before him, and arranges
his work accordingly. The phrase “on account of which” they wish to be confined to the
end or purpose, the bench, as they say, being produced for, or on account of, the use of

<p>That there is no distinction in the scriptural use of these syllables.</p>
<p>6. We acknowledge that the word of truth has in many places made use of these expressions;
yet we absolutely deny that the freedom of the Spirit is in bondage to the pettiness of
Paganism. On the contrary, we maintain that Scripture varies its expressions as occasion
requires, according to the circumstances of the case. For instance, the phrase “of which”
does not always and absolutely, as they suppose, indicate the material,725 but it is more in
accordance with the usage of Scripture to apply this term in the case of the Supreme Cause,
as in the words “One God, of whom are all things,”726 and again, “All things of God.”727
The word of truth has, however, frequently used this term in the case of the material, as
when it says “Thou shalt make an ark of incorruptible wood;”728 and “Thou shalt make the
candlestick of pure gold;”729 and “The first man is of the earth, earthy;”730 and “Thou art
formed out of clay as I am.”731 But these men, to the end, as we have already remarked,
that they may establish the difference of nature, have laid down the law that this phrase befits
the Father alone. This distinction they have originally derived from heathen authorities,
but here they have shewn no faithful accuracy of limitation. To the Son they have in conformity
with the teaching of their masters given the title of instrument, and to the Spirit
that of place, for they say in the Spirit, and through the Son. But when they apply “of whom”
to God they no longer follow heathen example, but “go over, as they say, to apostolic usage,
as it is said, “But of him are ye in Christ Jesus,”732 and “All things of God.”733 What, then,

is the result of this systematic discussion? There is one nature of Cause; another of Instrument;
another of Place. So the Son is by nature distinct from the Father, as the tool from

nature of tools or from that of them that handle them.</p>

<p>That “through whom” is said also in the case of the Father, and “of whom” in the case of the
Son and of the Spirit.</p>
<p>7. After thus describing the outcome of our adversaries’ arguments, we shall now proceed
to shew, as we have proposed, that the Father does not first take “of whom” and then abandon
“through whom” to the Son; and that there is no truth in these men’s ruling that the Son
refuses to admit the Holy Spirit to a share in “of whom” or in “through whom,” according
to the limitation of their new-fangled allotment of phrases. “There is one God and Father
of whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus Christ through whom are all things.”734</p>
<p>Yes; but these are the words of a writer not laying down a rule, but carefully distinguishing
the hypostases.735</p>
<p>The object of the apostle in thus writing was not to introduce the diversity of nature,
but to exhibit the notion of Father and of Son as unconfounded. That the phrases are not
opposed to one another and do not, like squadrons in war marshalled one against another,
bring the natures to which they are applied into mutual conflict, is perfectly plain from the
passage in question. The blessed Paul brings both phrases to bear upon one and the same
subject, in the words “of him and through him and to him are all things.”736 That this
plainly refers to the Lord will be admitted even by a reader paying but small attention to the
meaning of the words. The apostle has just quoted from the prophecy of Isaiah, “Who hath
known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his counsellor,”737 and then goes on, “For
of him and from him and to him are all things.” That the prophet is speaking about God
the Word, the Maker of all creation, may be learnt from what immediately precedes: “Who
hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span,
and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales,
and the hills in a balance? Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his counsellor
hath taught him?”738 Now the word “who” in this passage does not mean absolute impossib-

“distinguishing the hypostases” would have been held impious. Some forty-five years later St. Basil writes to
his brother, Gregory of Nyssa (Ep. xxxviii.), in fear lest Gregory should fall into the error of failing to distinguish
between hypostasis and ousia, between person and essence. cf. Theodoret Dial. i. 7, and my note on his Ecc. Hist. i. 3.</note>

ility, but rarity, as in the passage “Who will rise up for me against the evil doers?”739 and
“What man is he that desireth life?”740 and “Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord?”741
So is it in the passage in question, “Who hath directed <del>lxx., known</del> the Spirit of the Lord,
or being his counsellor hath known him?” “For the Father loveth the Son and sheweth him
all things.”742 This is He who holds the earth, and hath grasped it with His hand, who
brought all things to order and adornment, who poised743 the hills in their places, and
measured the waters, and gave to all things in the universe their proper rank, who encompasseth
the whole of heaven with but a small portion of His power, which, in a figure, the
prophet calls a span. Well then did the apostle add “Of him and through him and to him
are all things.”744 For of Him, to all things that are, comes the cause of their being, according
to the will of God the Father. Through Him all things have their continuance745 and constitution,
746 for He created all things, and metes out to each severally what is necessary for
its health and preservation. Wherefore to Him all things are turned, looking with irresistible
longing and unspeakable affection to “the author”747 and maintainer “of” their “life,” as it
is written “The eyes of all wait upon thee,”748 and again, “These wait all upon thee,”749 and
“Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.”750</p>
<p>8. But if our adversaries oppose this our interpretation, what argument will save them
from being caught in their own trap?</p>
<p>For if they will not grant that the three expressions “of him” and “through him” and “to
him” are spoken of the Lord, they cannot but be applied to God the Father. Then without
question their rule will fall through, for we find not only “of whom,” but also “through
whom” applied to the Father. And if this latter phrase indicates nothing derogatory, why
in the world should it be confined, as though conveying the sense of inferiority, to the Son?
If it always and everywhere implies ministry, let them tell us to what superior the God of
glory751 and Father of the Christ is subordinate.</p>

<p>They are thus overthrown by their own selves, while our position will be on both sides
made sure. Suppose it proved that the passage refers to the Son, “of whom” will be found
applicable to the Son. Suppose on the other hand it be insisted that the prophet’s words
relate to God, then it will be granted that “through whom” is properly used of God, and
both phrases have equal value, in that both are used with equal force of God. Under either
alternative both terms, being employed of one and the same Person, will be shewn to be
equivalent. But let us revert to our subject.</p>
<p>9. In his Epistle to the Ephesians the apostle says, “But speaking the truth in love, may
grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ; from whom the whole body
fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the
effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body.”752</p>
<p>And again in the Epistle to the Colossians, to them that have not the knowledge of the
Only Begotten, there is mention of him that holdeth “the head,” that is, Christ, “from which
all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered increaseth with the increase
of God.”753 And that Christ is the head of the Church we have learned in another passage,
when the apostle says “gave him to be the head over all things to the Church,”754 and “of
his fulness have all we received.”755 And the Lord Himself says “He shall take of mine, and
shall shew it unto you.”756 In a word, the diligent reader will perceive that “of whom” is
used in diverse manners.757 For instance, the Lord says, “I perceive that virtue is gone out
of me.”758 Similarly we have frequently observed “of whom” used of the Spirit. “He that
soweth to the spirit,” it is said, “shall of the spirit reap life everlasting.”759 John too writes,
“Hereby we know that he abideth in us by (ἐκ) the spirit which he hath given us.”760 “That
which is conceived in her,” says the angel, “is of the Holy Ghost,”761 and the Lord says “that
which is born of the spirit is spirit.”762 Such then is the case so far.</p>

<p>10. It must now be pointed out that the phrase “through whom” is admitted by Scripture
in the case of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost alike. It would indeed be tedious
to bring forward evidence of this in the case of the Son, not only because it is perfectly
well known, but because this very point is made by our opponents. We now show that
“through whom” is used also in the case of the Father. “God is faithful,” it is said, “by whom
(δι᾽ οὖ) ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son,”763 and “Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ
by (διά) the will of God;” and again, “Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and
if a son, then an heir through God.”764 And “like as Christ was raised up from the dead by
(διά) the glory of God the Father.”765 Isaiah, moreover, says, “Woe unto them that make
deep counsel and not through the Lord;”766 and many proofs of the use of this phrase in
the case of the Spirit might be adduced. “God hath revealed him to us,” it is said, “by (διά)
the spirit;”767 and in another place, “That good thing which was committed unto thee keep
by (διά) the Holy Ghost;”768 and again, “To one is given by (διά) the spirit the word of
wisdom.”769</p>
<p>11. In the same manner it may also be said of the word “in,” that Scripture admits its
use in the case of God the Father. In the Old Testament it is said through (ἐν) God we shall
do valiantly,770 and, “My praise shall be continually of (ἐν) thee;”771 and again, “In thy
name will I rejoice.”772 In Paul we read, “In God who created all things,”773 and, “Paul and
Silvanus and Timotheus unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father;”774 and
“if now at length I might have a prosperous journey by (ἐν) the will of God to come to

quotations from the New Testament on the point in question, St. Basil has omitted Heb. ii. 10, “It became him
for whom (δι᾽ ὅν) are all things and through whom (δι᾽ οὗ) are all things,” “where the Father is described as being
the final Cause and efficient Cause of all things.”</note>

reckon; but what we want is not so much to exhibit an abundance of evidence as to prove
that the conclusions of our opponents are unsound. I shall, therefore, omit any proof of
this usage in the case of our Lord and of the Holy Ghost, in that it is notorious. But I cannot
forbear to remark that “the wise hearer” will find sufficient proof of the proposition before
him by following the method of contraries. For if the difference of language indicates, as
we are told, that the nature has been changed, then let identity of language compel our adversaries
to confess with shame that the essence is unchanged.</p>
<p>12. And it is not only in the case of the theology that the use of the terms varies,777 but
whenever one of the terms takes the meaning of the other we find them frequently transferred
from the one subject to the other. As, for instance, Adam says, “I have gotten a man through
God,”778 meaning to say the same as from God; and in another passage “Moses commanded<gap reason="omitted"/>
Israel through the word of the Lord,”779 and, again, “Is not the interpretation
through God?”780 Joseph, discoursing about dreams to the prisoners, instead of saying
“from God” says plainly “through God.” Inversely Paul uses the term “from whom” instead
of “through whom,” when he says “made from a woman” (A.V., “of” instead of “through a
woman”).781 And this he has plainly distinguished in another passage, where he says that
it is proper to a woman to be made of the man, and to a man to be made through the woman,
in the words “For as the woman is from <del>A.V., of</del> the man, even so is the man also through
<del>A.V., by</del> the woman.”782 Nevertheless in the passage in question the apostle, while illustrating
the variety of usage, at the same time corrects obiter the error of those who supposed

that the body of the Lord was a spiritual body,783 and, to shew that the God-bearing784 flesh
was formed out of the common lump785 of human nature, gave precedence to the more
emphatic preposition.</p>
<p>The phrase “through a woman” would be likely to give rise to the suspicion of mere
transit in the generation, while the phrase “of the woman” would satisfactorily indicate that
the nature was shared by the mother and the offspring. The apostle was in no wise contradicting
himself, but he shewed that the words can without difficulty be interchanged. Since,
therefore, the term “from whom” is transferred to the identical subjects in the case of which
“through whom” is decided to be properly used, with what consistency can these phrases
be invariably distinguished one from the other, in order that fault may be falsely found with
true religion?</p>

Also concerning the equal glory.</p>
<p>13. Our opponents, while they thus artfully and perversely encounter our argument,
cannot even have recourse to the plea of ignorance. It is obvious that they are annoyed with
us for completing the doxology to the Only Begotten together with the Father, and for not
separating the Holy Spirit from the Son. On this account they style us innovators, revolutionizers,
phrase-coiners, and every other possible name of insult. But so far am I from being
irritated at their abuse, that, were it not for the fact that their loss causes me “heaviness and
continual sorrow,”786 I could almost have said that I was grateful to them for the blasphemy,
as though they were agents for providing me with blessing. For “blessed are ye,” it is said,
“when men shall revile you for my sake.”787 The grounds of their indignation are these:
The Son, according to them, is not together with the Father, but after the Father. Hence it
follows that glory should be ascribed to the Father “through him,” but not “with him;”
inasmuch as “with him” expresses equality of dignity, while “through him” denotes subordination.
They further assert that the Spirit is not to be ranked along with the Father and
the Son, but under the Son and the Father; not coordinated, but subordinated; not connumerated,
but subnumerated.788</p>
<p>With technical terminology of this kind they pervert the simplicity and artlessness of
the faith, and thus by their ingenuity, suffering no one else to remain in ignorance, they cut
off from themselves the plea that ignorance might demand.</p>
<p>14. Let us first ask them this question: In what sense do they say that the Son is “after
the Father;” later in time, or in order, or in dignity? But in time no one is so devoid of sense
as to assert that the Maker of the ages789 holds a second place, when no interval intervenes
in the natural conjunction of the Father with the Son.790 And indeed so far as our conception
of human relations goes,791 it is impossible to think of the Son as being later than the
Father, not only from the fact that Father and Son are mutually conceived of in accordance
with the relationship subsisting between them, but because posteriority in time is predicated

of subjects separated by a less interval from the present, and priority of subjects farther off.
For instance, what happened in Noah’s time is prior to what happened to the men of Sodom,
inasmuch as Noah is more remote from our own day; and, again, the events of the history
of the men of Sodom are posterior, because they seem in a sense to approach nearer to our
own day. But, in addition to its being a breach of true religion, is it not really the extremest
folly to measure the existence of the life which transcends all time and all the ages by its
distance from the present? Is it not as though God the Father could be compared with, and
be made superior to, God the Son, who exists before the ages, precisely in the same way in
which things liable to beginning and corruption are described as prior to one another?</p>
<p>The superior remoteness of the Father is really inconceivable, in that thought and intelligence
are wholly impotent to go beyond the generation of the Lord; and St. John has admirably
confined the conception within circumscribed boundaries by two words, “In the
beginning was the Word.” For thought cannot travel outside “was,” nor imagination792
beyond “beginning.” Let your thought travel ever so far backward you cannot get beyond
the “was,” and however you may strain and strive to see what is beyond the Son, you will
find it impossible to get further than the “beginning.” True religion, therefore, thus teaches
us to think of the Son together with the Father.</p>
<p>15. If they really conceive of a kind of degradation of the Son in relation to the Father,
as though He were in a lower place, so that the Father sits above, and the Son is thrust off
to the next seat below, let them confess what they mean. We shall have no more to say. A
plain statement of the view will at once expose its absurdity. They who refuse to allow that
the Father pervades all things do not so much as maintain the logical sequence of thought
in their argument. The faith of the sound is that God fills all things;793 but they who divide
their up and down between the Father and the Son do not remember even the word of the
Prophet: “If I climb up into heaven thou art there; if I go down to hell thou art there also.”794
Now, to omit all proof of the ignorance of those who predicate place of incorporeal things,
what excuse can be found for their attack upon Scripture, shameless as their antagonism is,
in the passages “Sit thou on my right hand”795 and “Sat down on the right hand of the
majesty of God”?796 The expression “right hand” does not, as they contend, indicate the

lower place, but equality of relation; it is not understood physically, in which case there
might be something sinister about God,797 but Scripture puts before us the magnificence
of the dignity of the Son by the use of dignified language indicating the seat of honour. It
is left then for our opponents to allege that this expression signifies inferiority of rank. Let
them learn that “Christ is the power of God and wisdom of God,”798 and that “He is the
image of the invisible God”799 and “brightness of his glory,”800 and that “Him hath God
the Father sealed,”801 by engraving Himself on Him.802</p>
<p>Now are we to call these passages, and others like them, throughout the whole of Holy
Scripture, proofs of humiliation, or rather public proclamations of the majesty of the Only
Begotten, and of the equality of His glory with the Father? We ask them to listen to the
Lord Himself, distinctly setting forth the equal dignity of His glory with the Father, in His
words, “He that hath seen me hath seen the Father;”803 and again, “When the Son cometh
in the glory of his Father;”804 that they “should honour the Son even as they honour the
Father;”805 and, “We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father;”806
and “the only begotten God which is in the bosom of the Father.”807 Of all these passages

bosom is a fit and becoming seat for a son, but the place of the footstool is for them that
have to be forced to fall.808</p>
<p>We have only touched cursorily on these proofs, because our object is to pass on to
other points. You at your leisure can put together the items of the evidence, and then contemplate
the height of the glory and the preeminence of the power of the Only Begotten.
However, to the well-disposed hearer, even these are not insignificant, unless the terms
“right hand” and “bosom” be accepted in a physical and derogatory sense, so as at once to
circumscribe God in local limits, and invent form, mould, and bodily position, all of which
are totally distinct from the idea of the absolute, the infinite, and the incorporeal. There is
moreover the fact that what is derogatory in the idea of it is the same in the case both of the
Father and the Son; so that whoever repeats these arguments does not take away the dignity
of the Son, but does incur the charge of blaspheming the Father; for whatever audacity a
man be guilty of against the Son he cannot but transfer to the Father. If he assigns to the
Father the upper place by way of precedence, and asserts that the only begotten Son sits
below, he will find that to the creature of his imagination attach all the consequent conditions
of body. And if these are the imaginations of drunken delusion and phrensied insanity, can
it be consistent with true religion for men taught by the Lord himself that “He that honoureth
not the Son honoureth not the Father”809 to refuse to worship and glorify with the Father
him who in nature, in glory, and in dignity is conjoined with him? What shall we say?
What just defence shall we have in the day of the awful universal judgment of all-creation,
if, when the Lord clearly announces that He will come “in the glory of his Father;”810 when
Stephen beheld Jesus standing at the right hand of God;811 when Paul testified in the spirit

the immutability and immobility of the Divine mode of existence, says, “For thou sittest for

<p>Against those who assert that it is not proper for “with whom” to be said of the Son, and that
the proper phrase is “through whom.”</p>
<p>16. But their contention is that to use the phrase “with him” is altogether strange and
unusual, while “through him” is at once most familiar in Holy Scripture, and very common
in the language of the brotherhood.817 What is our answer to this? We say, Blessed are the
ears that have not heard you and the hearts that have been kept from the wounds of your
words. To you, on the other hand, who are lovers of Christ,818 I say that the Church recognizes
both uses, and deprecates neither as subversive of the other. For whenever we are
contemplating the majesty of the nature of the Only Begotten, and the excellence of His
dignity, we bear witness that the glory is with the Father; while on the other hand, whenever
we bethink us of His bestowal819 on us of good gifts, and of our access820 to, and admission
into, the household of God,821 we confess that this grace is effected for us through Him and
by822Him.</p>
<p>It follows that the one phrase “with whom” is the proper one to be used in the ascription
of glory, while the other, “through whom,” is specially appropriate in giving of thanks. It is
also quite untrue to allege that the phrase “with whom” is unfamiliar in the usage of the
devout. All those whose soundness of character leads them to hold the dignity of antiquity
to be more honourable than mere new-fangled novelty, and who have preserved the tradition
of their fathers823 unadulterated, alike in town and in country, have employed this phrase.
It is, on the contrary, they who are surfeited with the familiar and the customary, and arrogantly
assail the old as stale, who welcome innovation, just as in dress your lovers of display
always prefer some utter novelty to what is generally worn. So you may even still see that
the language of country folk preserves the ancient fashion, while of these, our cunning experts824
in logomachy, the language bears the brand of the new philosophy.</p>

<p>What our fathers said, the same say we, that the glory of the Father and of the Son is

only on the fact that such is the tradition of the Fathers; for they too followed the sense of
Scripture, and started from the evidence which, a few sentences back, I deduced from
Scripture and laid before you. For “the brightness” is always thought of with “the glory,”825

<p>In how many ways “Throughwhom” is used; and in what sense “with whom” is more suitable.
Explanation of how the Son receives a commandment, and how He is sent.</p>
<p>17. When, then, the apostle “thanks God through Jesus Christ,”827 and again says that
“through Him” we have “received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among
all nations,”828 or “through Him have access unto this grace wherein we stand and rejoice,”829
he sets forth the boons conferred on us by the Son, at one time making the grace of the good
gifts pass through from the Father to us, and at another bringing us to the Father through
Himself. For by saying “through whom we have received grace and apostleship,”830 he declares
the supply of the good gifts to proceed from that source; and again in saying “through
whom we have had access,”831 he sets forth our acceptance and being made “of the household
of God”832 through Christ. Is then the confession of the grace wrought by Him to usward
a detraction from His glory? Is it not truer to say that the recital of His benefits is a proper
argument for glorifying Him? It is on this account that we have not found Scripture describing
the Lord to us by one name, nor even by such terms alone as are indicative of His godhead
and majesty. At one time it uses terms descriptive of His nature, for it recognises the “name
which is above every name,”833 the name of Son,834 and speaks of true Son,835 and only
begotten God,836 and Power of God,837 and Wisdom,838 and Word.839 Then again, on
account of the divers manners840 wherein grace is given to us, which, because of the riches

And these titles do not set forth His nature, but, as I have remarked, the variety of the effectual
working which, out of His tender-heartedness to His own creation, according to the
peculiar necessity of each, He bestows upon them that need. Them that have fled for refuge

that have now reached a higher stage and stand in need of righteous royalty,854 He is a King.

their readiness to distribute,” has the best manuscript authority, but it is barely intelligible; and the Benedictine
Editors are quite right in calling attention to the fact that the point in question here is not the readiness of the
flock to distribute (cf. 1 Tim. vi. 18), but their patient following of their Master. The Benedictine Editors boldly
propose to introduce a word of no authority τὸ ἀμετάβολον, rendering qui per patientiam animam immutabilem
præbuerunt. The reading adopted above is supported by a passage in Ep. 244, where St. Basil is speaking of the
waywardness of Eustathius, and seems to fit in best with the application of the passage to the words of our Lord,
“have fled for refuge to his ruling care,” corresponding with “the sheep follow him, for they know his voice” (St.
John x. 4), and “have mended their wayward ways,” with “a stranger will they not follow,” v. 5. Mr. Johnston,

<p>So He says, “By me if any man enter in, he shall go in and out and shall find pastare.”856
Again, because to the faithful He is a defence strong, unshaken, and harder to break than
any bulwark, He is a Rock. Among these titles, it is when He is styled Door, or Way, that
the phrase “through Him” is very appropriate and plain. As, however, God and Son, He is
glorified with and together with857 the Father, in that “at, the name of Jesus every knee
should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that
every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”858
Wherefore we use both terms, expressing by the one His own proper dignity, and by the
other His grace to usward.</p>
<p>18. For “through Him” comes every succour to our souls, and it is in accordance with
each kind of care that an appropriate title has been devised. So when He presents to Himself
the blameless soul, not having spot or wrinkle,859 like a pure maiden, He is called Bridegroom,
but whenever He receives one in sore plight from the devil’s evil strokes, healing it in the
heavy infirmity of its sins, He is named Physician. And shall this His care for us degrade
to meanness our thoughts of Him? Or, on the contrary, shall it smite us with amazement
at once at the mighty power and love to man860 of the Saviour, in that He both endured to
suffer with us861 in our infirmities, and was able to come down to our weakness? For not
heaven and earth and the great seas, not the creatures that live in the water and on dry land,
not plants, and stars, and air, and seasons, not the vast variety in the order of the universe,862
so well sets forth the excellency of His might as that God, being incomprehensible, should
have been able, impassibly, through flesh, to have come into close conflict with death, to
the end that by His own suffering He might give us the boon of freedom from suffering.863

The apostle, it is true, says, “In all these things we are more than conquerors through him
that loved us.”864 But in a phrase of this kind there is no suggestion of any lowly and subordinate
ministry,865 but rather of the succour rendered “in the power of his might.”866
For He Himself has bound the strong man and spoiled his goods,867 that is, us men, whom
our enemy had abused in every evil activity, and made “vessels meet for the Master’s use”868
us who have been perfected for every work through the making ready of that part of us
which is in our own control.869 Thus we have had our approach to the Father through Him,
being translated from “the power of darkness to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints
in light.”870 We must not, however, regard the oeconomy871 through the Son as a compulsory
and subordinate ministration resulting from the low estate of a slave, but rather the voluntary
solicitude working effectually for His own creation in goodness and in pity, according to
the will of God the Father. For we shall be consistent with true religion if in all that was and
is from time to time perfected by Him, we both bear witness to the perfection of His power,
and in no case put it asunder from the Father’s will. For instance, whenever the Lord is

ἡμῖν), but to be made capable of going is of Him that gives the grace, of the enabling God.” The Benedictine
translation of the text is “per liberi arbitrii nostri præparationem.” But other readings are (i) τῆς ἑτοιμασίας

called the Way, we are carried on to a higher meaning, and not to that which is derived from
the vulgar sense of the word. We understand by Way that advance872 to perfection which
is made stage by stage, and in regular order, through the works of righteousness and “the
illumination of knowledge;”873 ever longing after what is before, and reaching forth unto
those things which remain,874 until we shall have reached the blessed end, the knowledge
of God, which the Lord through Himself bestows on them that have trusted in Him. For
our Lord is an essentially good Way, where erring and straying are unknown, to that which
is essentially good, to the Father. For “no one,” He says, “cometh to the Father but <del>“by”
A.V.</del> through me.”875 Such is our way up to God “through the Son.”</p>
<p>19. It will follow that we should next in order point out the character of the provision
of blessings bestowed on us by the Father “through him.” Inasmuch as all created nature,
both this visible world and all that is conceived of in the mind, cannot hold together without
the care and providence of God, the Creator Word, the Only begotten God, apportioning
His succour according to the measure of the needs of each, distributes mercies various and
manifold on account of the many kinds and characters of the recipients of His bounty, but
appropriate to the necessities of individual requirements. Those that are confined in the
darkness of ignorance He enlightens: for this reason He is true Light.876 Portioning requital
in accordance with the desert of deeds, He judges: for this reason He is righteous Judge.877
“For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son.”878 Those
that have lapsed from the lofty height of life into sin He raises from their fall: for this reason
He is Resurrection.879 Effectually working by the touch of His power and the will of His
goodness He does all things. He shepherds; He enlightens; He nourishes; He heals; He
guides; He raises up; He calls into being things that were not; He upholds what has been
created. Thus the good things that come from God reach us “through the Son,” who works
in each case with greater speed than speech can utter. For not lightnings, not light’s course
in air, is so swift; not eyes’ sharp turn, not the movements of our very thought. Nay, by the
divine energy is each one of these in speed further surpassed than is the slowest of all living
creatures outdone in motion by birds, or even winds, or the rush of the heavenly bodies:
or, not to mention these, by our very thought itself. For what extent of time is needed by

Him who “upholds all things by the word of His power,”880 and works not by bodily agency,
nor requires the help of hands to form and fashion, but holds in obedient following and
unforced consent the nature of all things that are? So as Judith says, “Thou hast thought,
and what things thou didst determine were ready at hand.”881 On the other hand, and lest

and what I should speak.”886 Through all these words He is guiding us to the knowledge
of the Father, and referring our wonder at all that is brought into existence to Him, to the
end that “through Him” we may know the Father. For the Father is not regarded from the
difference of the operations, by the exhibition of a separate and peculiar energy; for whatso-

<note type="footnote">882 ἄναρχος. This word is used in two senses by the Fathers. (i) In the sense of ἀΐδιος or eternal, it is applied
(a) to the Trinity in unity. e.g., Quæst. Misc. v. 442 (Migne Ath. iv. 783), attributed to Athanasius, κοινον ἡ
οὐσια· κοινὸν το ἄναρχον. (b) To the Son. e.g., Greg. Naz. Orat. xxix. 490, ἐὰν τὴν ἀπὸ χρόνον νοῇς ἀρχὴν
καὶ ἄναρχος ὁ υἱU+0026 232·ς, οὐκ ἄρχεται γὰρ ἀπὸ χρόνου ὁ χρόνων δεσπότης. (ii) In the sense of ἀναίτιος,
“causeless,” “originis principio carens,” it is applied to the Father alone, and not to the Son. So Gregory of
Nazianzus, in the oration quoted above, ὁ υἱU+0026 232·ς, ἐU+0026 129·ν ὡς αἴτιον τὸν πατέρα λαμβάνῃς, οὐκ ἄναρχος,
“the Son, if you understand the Father as cause, is not without beginning.” ἄρχη γὰρ υἱοῦ πατὴρ ὡς αἴτιος.
“For the Father, as cause, is Beginning of the Son.” But, though the Son in this sense was not ἄναρχος, He was
said to be begotten ἀνάρχως. So Greg. Naz. (Hom. xxxvii. 590) τὸ ἴδιον ὄνομα τοῦ ἀνάρχως γεννηθέντος, υὶU+0026
231·ς. Cf. the Letter of Alexander of Alexandria to Alexander of Constantinople. Theod. Ecc. Hist. i. 3. τὴν
ἄναρχον αὐτῷ παρὰ τοῦ πατρὸς γέννησιν ἀνατί θεντας. cf. Hooker, Ecc. Pol. v. 54. “By the gift of eternal generation
Christ hath received of the Father one and in number the self-same substance which the Father hath of
himself unreceived from any other. For every beginning is a father unto that which cometh of it; and every offspring
is a son unto that out of which it groweth. Seeing, therefore, the Father alone is originally that Deity which
Christ originally is not (for Christ is God by being of God, light by issuing out of light), it followeth hereupon
that whatsoever Christ hath common unto him with his heavenly Father, the same of necessity must be given
him, but naturally and eternally given.” So Hillary De Trin. xii. 21. “Ubi auctor eternus est, ibi et nativatis
æternitas est: quia sicut nativitas ab auctore est, ita et ab æterno auctore æterna nativitas est.” And Augustine

ever things He sees the Father doing, “these also doeth the Son likewise;”887 but He enjoys
our wonder at all that comes to pass out of the glory which comes to Him from the Only
Begotten, rejoicing in the Doer Himself as well as in the greatness of the deeds, and exalted
by all who acknowledge Him as Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, “through whom <del>by whom,
A.V.</del> are all things, and for whom are all things.”888 Wherefore, saith the Lord, “All mine
are thine,”889 as though the sovereignty over created things were conferred on Him, and
“Thine are mine,” as though the creating Cause came thence to Him. We are not to suppose
that He used assistance in His action, or yet was entrusted with the ministry of each individual
work by detailed commission, a condition distinctly menial and quite inadequate to
the divine dignity. Rather was the Word full of His Father’s excellences; He shines forth
from the Father, and does all things according to the likeness of Him that begat Him. For
if in essence He is without variation, so also is He without variation in power.890 And of
those whose power is equal, the operation also is in all ways equal. And Christ is the power
of God, and the wisdom of God.891 And so “all things are made through <del>by, A.V.</del> him,”892
and “all things were created through <del>by, A.V.</del> him and for him,”893 not in the discharge
of any slavish service, but in the fulfilment of the Father’s will as Creator.</p>

said unto me, so I speak,”895 and “The word which ye hear is not mine, but <del>the Father’s</del>
which sent me,”896 and in another place, “As the Father gave me commandment, even so I
do,”897 it is not because He lacks deliberate purpose or power of initiation, nor yet because
He has to wait for the preconcerted key-note, that he employs language of this kind. His
object is to make it plain that His own will is connected in indissoluble union with the

Father. Do not then let us understand by what is called a “commandment” a peremptory
mandate delivered by organs of speech, and giving orders to the Son, as to a subordinate,
concerning what He ought to do. Let us rather, in a sense befitting the Godhead, perceive
a transmission of will, like the reflexion of an object in a mirror, passing without note of
time from Father to Son. “For the Father loveth the Son and sheweth him all things,”898 so
that “all things that the Father hath” belong to the Son, not gradually accruing to Him little
by little, but with Him all together and at once. Among men, the workman who has been
thoroughly taught his craft, and, through long training, has sure and established experience
in it, is able, in accordance with the scientific methods which now he has in store, to work
for the future by himself. And are we to suppose that the wisdom of God, the Maker of all
creation, He who is eternally perfect, who is wise, without a teacher, the Power of God, “in
whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,”899 needs piecemeal instruction
to mark out the manner and measure of His operations? I presume that in the vanity of
your calculations, you mean to open a school; you will make the one take His seat in the
teacher’s place, and the other stand by in a scholar’s ignorance, gradually learning wisdom
and advancing to perfection, by lessons given Him bit by bit. Hence, if you have sense to
abide by what logically follows, you will find the Son being eternally taught, nor yet ever
able to reach the end of perfection, inasmuch as the wisdom of the Father is infinite, and
the end of the infinite is beyond apprehension. It results that whoever refuses to grant that
the Son has all things from the beginning will never grant that He will reach perfection.
But I am ashamed at the degraded conception to which, by the course of the argument, I
have been brought down. Let us therefore revert to the loftier themes of our discussion.</p>
<p>21. “He that hath seen me hath seen the Father;900 not the express image, nor yet the
form, for the divine nature does not admit of combination; but the goodness of the will,
which, being concurrent with the essence, is beheld as like and equal, or rather the same, in
the Father as in the Son.901</p>

<note type="footnote">901 The argument appears to be not that Christ is not the “express image,” or impress of the Father, as He is
described in Heb. i. 3, or form, as in Phil. ii. 6, but that this is not the sense in which our Lord’s words in St. John
xiv. 9, must be understood to describe “seeing the Father.” Χαρακτὴρ and μορφὴ are equivalent to ἡ θεία φύσις,
and μορφή is used by St. Basil as it is used by St. Paul,—coinciding with, if not following, the usage of the older
Greek philosophy,—to mean essential attributes which the Divine Word had before the incarnation (cf. Eustathius
in Theod. Dial. II. [Wace and Schaff Ed., p. 203]; “the express image made man,”—ὁ τῷ πνεύματι
σωματοποιηθεὶς ἄνθρωπος χαρακτήρ.) The divine nature does not admit of combination, in the sense of confusion
(cf. the protests of Theodoret in his Dialogues against the confusion of the Godhead and manhood in the Christ),</note>

<p>What then is meant by “became subject”?902 What by “delivered him up for us all”?903
It is meant that the Son has it of the Father that He works in goodness on behalf of men.
But you must hear too the words, “Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law;”904
and “while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”905</p>
<p>Give careful heed, too, to the words of the Lord, and note how, whenever He instructs
us about His Father, He is in the habit of using terms of personal authority, saying, “I will;
be thou clean;”906 and “Peace, be still;”907 and “But I say unto you;”908 and “Thou dumb
and deaf spirit, I charge thee;”909 and all other expressions of the same kind, in order that
by these we may recognise our Master and Maker, and by the former may be taught the
Father of our Master and Creator.910 Thus on all sides is demonstrated the true doctrine
that the fact that the Father creates through the Son neither constitutes the creation of the
Father imperfect nor exhibits the active energy of the Son as feeble, but indicates the unity
of the will; so the expression “through whom” contains a confession of an antecedent Cause,
and is not adopted in objection to the efficient Cause.</p>

<p>Definitive conceptions about the Spirit which conform to the teaching of the Scriptures.</p>
<p>22. Let us now investigate what are our common conceptions concerning the Spirit, as
well those which have been gathered by us from Holy Scripture concerning It as those which
we have received from the unwritten tradition of the Fathers. First of all we ask, who on
hearing the titles of the Spirit is not lifted up in soul, who does not raise his conception to
the supreme nature? It is called “Spirit of God,”911 “Spirit of truth which proceedeth from
the Father,”912 “right Spirit,”913 “a leading Spirit.”914 Its915 proper and peculiar title is
“Holy Spirit;” which is a name specially appropriate to everything that is incorporeal, purely
immaterial, and indivisible. So our Lord, when teaching the woman who thought God to
be an object of local worship that the incorporeal is incomprehensible, said “God is a spirit.”
916 On our hearing, then, of a spirit, it is impossible to form the idea of a nature circumscribed,
subject to change and variation, or at all like the creature. We are compelled to
advance in our conceptions to the highest, and to think of an intelligent essence, in power
infinite, in magnitude unlimited, unmeasured by times or ages, generous of Its good gifts,
to whom turn all things needing sanctification, after whom reach all things that live in virtue,
as being watered by Its inspiration and helped on toward their natural and proper end;
perfecting all other things, but Itself in nothing lacking; living not as needing restoration,
but as Supplier of life; not growing by additions; but straightway full, self-established, omnipresent,
origin of sanctification, light perceptible to the mind, supplying, as it were, through
Itself, illumination to every faculty in the search for truth; by nature unapproachable, apprehended
by reason of goodness, filling all things with Its power,917 but communicated only
to the worthy; not shared in one measure, but distributing Its energy according to “the
proportion of faith;”918 in essence simple, in powers various, wholly present in each and
being wholly everywhere; impassively divided, shared without loss of ceasing to be entire,
after the likeness of the sunbeam, whose kindly light falls on him who enjoys it as though
it shone for him alone, yet illumines land and sea and mingles with the air. So, too, is the

Spirit to every one who receives it, as though given to him alone, and yet It sends forth grace
sufficient and full for all mankind, and is enjoyed by all who share It, according to the capacity,
not of Its power, but of their nature.</p>
<p>23. Now the Spirit is not brought into intimate association with the soul by local approximation.
How indeed could there be a corporeal approach to the incorporeal? This
association results from the withdrawal of the passions which, coming afterwards gradually
on the soul from its friendship to the flesh, have alienated it from its close relationship with
God. Only then after a man is purified from the shame whose stain he took through his
wickedness, and has come back again to his natural beauty, and as it were cleaning the
Royal Image and restoring its ancient form, only thus is it possible for him to draw near to
the Paraclete.919 And He, like the sun, will by the aid of thy purified eye show thee in
Himself the image of the invisible, and in the blessed spectacle of the image thou shalt behold
the unspeakable beauty of the archetype.920 Through His aid hearts are lifted up, the weak
are held by the hand, and they who are advancing are brought to perfection.921 Shining
upon those that are cleansed from every spot, He makes them spiritual by fellowship with
Himself. Just as when a sunbeam falls on bright and transparent bodies, they themselves
become brilliant too, and shed forth a fresh brightness from themselves, so souls wherein
the Spirit dwells, illuminated by the Spirit, themselves become spiritual, and send forth their
grace to others. Hence comes foreknowledge of the future, understanding of mysteries,
apprehension of what is hidden, distribution of good gifts, the heavenly citizenship, a place
in the chorus of angels, joy without end, abiding in God, the being made like to God, and,
highest of all, the being made God.922 Such, then, to instance a few out of many, are the
<note type="footnote">919 cf. Theodoret, Dial. i. p. 164, Schaff and Wace’s ed. “Sin is not of nature, but of corrupt will.” So the ninth

man.” On the figure of the restored picture cf. Ath. de Incar. § 14, and Theod. Dial. ii. p. 183.</note>

us and Christ as the image of God; but it is in proportion as we are like Christ that we see God in Christ. It is
the “pure in heart” who “see God.”</note>

<p>Against those who say that it is not right to rank the Holy Spirit with the Father and the Son.</p>
<p>24. But we must proceed to attack our opponents, in the endeavour to confute those
“oppositions” advanced against us which are derived from “knowledge falsely so-called.”924</p>
<p>It is not permissible, they assert, for the Holy Spirit to be ranked with the Father and
Son, on account of the difference of His nature and the inferiority of His dignity. Against
them it is right to reply in the words of the apostles, “We ought to obey God rather than
men.”925</p>
<p>For if our Lord, when enjoining the baptism of salvation, charged His disciples to baptize
all nations in the name “of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,”926 not disdaining
fellowship with Him, and these men allege that we must not rank Him with the Father
and the Son, is it not clear that they openly withstand the commandment of God? If they
deny that coordination of this kind is declaratory of any fellowship and conjunction, let
them tell us why it behoves us to hold this opinion, and what more intimate mode of conjunction927
they have.</p>

do not928 let them lay the blame of conjunction upon us, for we neither hold nor say anything

of the Spirit, against the Arians and Semi-Arians, of whom Euonomius and Macedonius were
leaders, the latter giving his name to the party who were unsound on the third Person of the Trinity, and were
Macedonians as well as Pneumatomachi. But even among the maintainers of the Nicene confession there was
much less clear apprehension of the nature and work of the Spirit than of the Son. Even so late as 380, the year
after St. Basil’s death, Gregory of Nazianzus, Orat. xxxi. de Spiritu Sancto, Cap. 5, wrote “of the wise on our side
some held it to be an energy, some a creature, some God. Others, from respect, they say, to Holy Scripture,
which lays down no law on the subject, neither worship nor dishonour the Holy Spirit.” cf. Schaff’s Hist. of
Christian Ch. III. Period, Sec. 128. In Letter cxxv. of St. Basil will be found a summary of the heresies with which
he credited the Arians, submitted to Eusthathius of Sebaste in 373, shortly before the composition of the present

Andrew of Samosata saw no difference between them. Athanasius (de Sent. Dionys. § 17) employs it for the

concealing the fact that, while an attack on us serves for a pretext for the war, the real aim
of these proceedings is higher. It is against us, they say, that they are preparing their engines
and their snares; against us that they are shouting to one another, according to each one’s
strength or cunning, to come on. But the object of attack is faith. The one aim of the whole
band of opponents and enemies of “sound doctrine”930 is to shake down the foundation of
the faith of Christ by levelling apostolic tradition with the ground, and utterly destroying
it. So like the debtors,—of course bona fide debtors—they clamour for written proof, and
reject as worthless the unwritten tradition of the Fathers.931 But we will not slacken in our
defence of the truth. We will not cowardly abandon the cause. The Lord has delivered to
us as a necessary and saving doctrine that the Holy Spirit is to be ranked with the Father.
Our opponents think differently, and see fit to divide and rend932 asunder, and relegate
Him to the nature of a ministering spirit. Is it not then indisputable that they make their
own blasphemy more authoritative than the law prescribed by the Lord? Come, then, set
aside mere contention. Let us consider the points before us, as follows:</p>
<p>26. Whence is it that we are Christians? Through our faith, would be the universal
answer. And in what way are we saved? Plainly because we were regenerate through the
grace given in our baptism. How else could we be? And after recognising that this salvation
is established through the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, shall we fling away “that
form of doctrine”933 which we received? Would it not rather be ground for great groaning
<note type="footnote">Erasmus, who has more clearly apprehended the drift of the argument. Basil brings his opponents to the dilemma
that the words ‘In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost’ either do or do not assert a
conjunction with the Father and the Son. If not, Basil ought not to be found fault with on the score of ‘conjunction,’
for he abides by the words of Scripture, and conjunction no more follows from his words than from those
of our Lord. If they do, he cannot be found fault with for following the words of Scripture. The attentive reader
will see this to be the meaning of Basil, and the received reading ought to be retained.”</note>

if we are found now further off from our salvation “than when we first believed,”934 and
deny now what we then received? Whether a man have departed this life without baptism,
or have received a baptism lacking in some of the requirements of the tradition, his loss is
equal.935 And whoever does not always and everywhere keep to and hold fast as a sure
protection the confession which we recorded at our first admission, when, being delivered
“from the idols,” we came “to the living God,”936 constitutes himself a “stranger” from the
“promises”937 of God, fighting against his own handwriting,938 which he put on record
when he professed the faith. For if to me my baptism was the beginning of life, and that
day of regeneration the first of days, it is plain that the utterance uttered in the grace of adoption
was the most honourable of all. Can I then, perverted by these men’s seductive
words, abandon the tradition which guided me to the light, which bestowed on me the boon
of the knowledge of God, whereby I, so long a foe by reason of sin, was made a child of
God? But, for myself, I pray that with this confession I may depart hence to the Lord, and
them I charge to preserve the faith secure until the day of Christ, and to keep the Spirit undivided
from the Father and the Son, preserving, both in the confession of faith and in the
doxology, the doctrine taught them at their baptism.</p>

<note type="footnote">935 The question is whether the baptism has been solemnized, according to the divine command, in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. St. Cyprian in his controversy with Stephen, Bp. of Rome,
represented the sterner view that heretical baptism was invalid. But, with some exceptions in the East, the position
ultimately prevailed that baptism with water, and in the prescribed words, by whomsoever administered,
was valid. So St. Augustine, “Si evangelicus verbis in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti Marcion baptismum
consecrabat, integrum erat Sacramentum, quamvis ejus fides sub eisdem verbis aliud opinantis quam catholica
veritas docet non esset integra.” (Cont. Petil. de unico bapt. § 3.) So the VIII. Canon of Arles (314), “De Afris,
quod propria lege sua utuntur ut rebaptizent, placuit, ut, si ad ecclesiam aliquis de hæresi venerit, interrogent eum
symbolum; et si perviderint eum in Patre, et Filio et Spiritu Sancto, esse baptizatum, manus ei tantum imponantur,
ut accipiat spiritum sanctum. Quod si interrogatus non responderit hanc Trinitatem, baptizetur.” So the VII.
Canon of Constantinople (381) by which the Eunomians who only baptized with one immersion, and the
Montanists, here called Phrygians, and the Sabellians, who taught the doctrine of the Fatherhood of the Son,
were counted as heathen. Vide Bright’s notes on the Canons of the Councils, p. 106. Socrates, v. 24, describes
how the Eunomi-Eutychians baptized not in the name of the Trinity, but into the death of Christ.</note>

<p>That they who deny the Spirit are transgressors.</p>
<p>27. “Who hath woe? Who hath sorrow?”939 For whom is distress and darkness? For
whom eternal doom? Is it not for the transgressors? For them that deny the faith? And
what is the proof of their denial? Is it not that they have set at naught their own confessions?
And when and what did they confess? Belief in the Father and in the Son and in the Holy
Ghost, when they renounced the devil and his angels, and uttered those saving words. What
fit title then for them has been discovered, for the children of light to use? Are they not
addressed as transgressors, as having violated the covenant of their salvation? What am I
to call the denial of God? What the denial of Christ? What but transgressions? And to him
who denies the Spirit, what title do you wish me to apply? Must it not be the same, inasmuch
as he has broken his covenant with God? And when the confession of faith in Him secures
the blessing of true religion. and its denial subjects men to the doom of godlessness, is it not
a fearful thing for them to set the confession at naught, not through fear of fire, or sword,
or cross, or scourge, or wheel, or rack, but merely led astray by the sophistry and seductions
of the pneumatomachi? I testify to every man who is confessing Christ and denying God,
that Christ will profit him nothing;940 to every man that calls upon God but rejects the Son,
that his faith is vain;941 to every man that sets aside the Spirit, that his faith in the Father
and the Son will be useless, for he cannot even hold it without the presence of the Spirit.
For he who does not believe the Spirit does not believe in the Son, and he who has not believed
in the Son does not believe in the Father. For none “can say that Jesus is the Lord
but by the Holy Ghost,”942 and “No man hath seen God at any time, but the only begotten
God which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.”943</p>
<p>Such an one hath neither part nor lot in the true worship; for it is impossible to worship
the Son, save by the Holy Ghost; impossible to call upon the Father, save by the Spirit of
adoption.</p>

<p>Against those who assert that the baptism in the name of the Father alone is sufficient.</p>
<p>28. Let no one be misled by the fact of the apostle’s frequently omitting the name of
the Father and of the Holy Spirit when making mention of baptism, or on this account
imagine that the invocation of the names is not observed. “As many of you,” he says, “as
were baptized into Christ have put on Christ;”944 and again, “As many of you as were baptized
into Christ were baptized into his death.”945 For the naming of Christ is the confession of
the whole,946 shewing forth as it does the God who gave, the Son who received, and the
Spirit who is, the unction.947 So we have learned from Peter, in the Acts, of “Jesus of Nazareth
whom God anointed with the Holy Ghost;”948 and in Isaiah, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon
me, because the Lord hath anointed me;”949 and the Psalmist, “Therefore God, even thy
God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.”950 Scripture, however,
in the case of baptism, sometimes plainly mentions the Spirit alone.951</p>
<p>“For into one Spirit,”952 it says, “we were all baptized in953 one body.”954 And in harmony
with this are the passages: “You shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost,”955 and “He
shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.”956 But no one on this account would be justified
in calling that baptism a perfect baptism wherein only the name of the Spirit was invoked.
For the tradition that has been given us by the quickening grace must remain for ever inviolate.
He who redeemed our life from destruction957 gave us power of renewal, whereof
the cause is ineffable and hidden in mystery, but bringing great salvation to our souls, so

that to add or to take away anything958 involves manifestly a falling away from the life
everlasting. If then in baptism the separation of the Spirit from the Father and the Son is
perilous to the baptizer, and of no advantage to the baptized, how can the rending asunder
of the Spirit from Father and from Son be safe for us?959 Faith and baptism are two kindred
and inseparable ways of salvation: faith is perfected through baptism, baptism is established
through faith, and both are completed by the same names. For as we believe in the Father
and the Son and the Holy Ghost, so are we also baptized in the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Ghost; first comes the confession, introducing us to salvation, and
baptism follows, setting the seal upon our assent.</p>

<p>Statement of the reason why in the writings of Paul the angels are associated with the Father
and the Son.</p>
<p>29. It is, however, objected that other beings which are enumerated with the Father and
the Son are certainly not always glorified together with them. The apostle, for instance, in
his charge to Timothy, associates the angels with them in the words, “I charge thee before
God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels.”960 We are not for alienating the angels
from the rest of creation, and yet, it is argued, we do not allow of their being reckoned with
the Father and the Son. To this I reply, although the argument, so obviously absurd is it,
does not really deserve a reply, that possibly before a mild and gentle judge, and especially
before One who by His leniency to those arraigned before Him demonstrates the unimpeachable
equity of His decisions, one might be willing to offer as witness even a fellow-slave; but
for a slave to be made free and called a son of God and quickened from death can only be
brought about by Him who has acquired natural kinship with us, and has been changed
from the rank of a slave. For how can we be made kin with God by one who is an alien?
How can we be freed by one who is himself under the yoke of slavery? It follows that the
mention of the Spirit and that of angels are not made under like conditions. The Spirit is
called on as Lord of life, and the angels as allies of their fellow-slaves and faithful witnesses
of the truth. It is customary for the saints to deliver the commandments of God in the
presence of witnesses, as also the apostle himself says to Timothy, “The things which thou
hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men;”961 and
now he calls the angels to witness, for he knows that angels shall be present with the Lord
when He shall come in the glory of His Father to judge the world in righteousness. For He
says, “Whoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of Man also confess before
the angels of God, but he that denieth Me before men shall be denied before the angels of
God;”962 and Paul in another place says, “When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from
heaven with his angels.”963 Thus he already testifies before the angels, preparing good
proofs for himself at the great tribunal.</p>
<p>30. And not only Paul, but generally all those to whom is committed any ministry of
the word, never cease from testifying, but call heaven and earth to witness on the ground
that now every deed that is done is done within them, and that in the examination of all the
actions of life they will be present with the judged. So it is said, “He shall call to the heavens

above and to earth, that he may judge his people.”964 And so Moses when about to deliver
his oracles to the people says, “I call heaven and earth to witness this day;”965 and again in
his song he says, “Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak, and hear, O earth, the words of
my mouth;”966 and Isaiah, “Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth;”967 and Jeremiah describes
astonishment in heaven at the tidings of the unholy deeds of the people: “The
heaven was astonished at this, and was horribly afraid, because my people committed two
evils.”968 And so the apostle, knowing the angels to be set over men as tutors and guardians,
calls them to witness. Moreover, Joshua, the son of Nun, even set up a stone as witness of
his words (already a heap somewhere had been called a witness by Jacob),969 for he says,
“Behold this stone shall be a witness unto you this day to the end of days, when ye lie to the
Lord our God,”970 perhaps believing that by God’s power even the stones would speak to
the conviction of the transgressors; or, if not, that at least each man’s conscience would be
wounded by the force of the reminder. In this manner they who have been entrusted with
the stewardship of souls provide witnesses, whatever they may be, so as to produce them at
some future day. But the Spirit is ranked together with God, not on account of the emergency
of the moment, but on account of the natural fellowship; is not dragged in by us, but invited
by the Lord.</p>

<p>Objection that some were baptized unto Moses and believed in him, and an answer to it; with
remarks upon types.</p>
<p>31. But even if some are baptized unto the Spirit, it is not, it is urged, on this account
right for the Spirit to be ranked with God. Some “were baptized unto Moses in the cloud
and in the sea.”971 And it is admitted that faith even before now has been put in men; for
“The people believed God and his servant Moses.”972 Why then, it is asked, do we, on account
of faith and of baptism, exalt and magnify the Holy Spirit so far above creation, when
there is evidence that the same things have before now been said of men? What, then, shall
we reply? Our answer is that the faith in the Spirit is the same as the faith in the Father and
the Son; and in like manner, too, the baptism. But the faith in Moses and in the cloud is, as
it were, in a shadow and type. The nature of the divine is very frequently represented by
the rough and shadowy outlines973 of the types; but because divine things are prefigured
by small and human things, it is obvious that we must not therefore conclude the divine
nature to be small. The type is an exhibition of things expected, and gives an imitative anticipation
of the future. So Adam was a type of “Him that was to come.”974 Typically, “That
rock was Christ;”975 and the water a type of the living power of the word; as He says, “If any
man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.”976 The manna is a type of the living bread
that came down from heaven;977 and the serpent on the standard,978 of the passion of salvation
accomplished by means of the cross, wherefore they who even looked thereon were
preserved. So in like manner, the history of the exodus of Israel is recorded to shew forth
those who are being saved through baptism. For the firstborn of the Israelites were preserved,
like the bodies of the baptized, by the giving of grace to them that were marked with blood.
For the blood of the sheep is a type of the blood of Christ; and the firstborn, a type of the
first-formed. And inasmuch as the first-formed of necessity exists in us, and, in sequence
of succession, is transmitted till the end, it follows that “in Adam” we “all die,”979 and that

“death reigned”980 until the fulfilling of the law and the coming of Christ. And the firstborn
were preserved by God from being touched by the destroyer, to show that we who were
made alive in Christ no longer die in Adam. The sea and the cloud for the time being led
on through amazement to faith, but for the time to come they typically prefigured the grace
to be. “Who is wise and he shall understand these things?”981—how the sea is typically a
baptism bringing about the departure of Pharaoh, in like manner as this washing causes the
departure of the tyranny of the devil. The sea slew the enemy in itself: and in baptism too
dies our enmity towards God. From the sea the people came out unharmed: we too, as it
were, alive from the dead, step up from the water “saved” by the “grace” of Him who called
us.982 And the cloud is a shadow of the gift of the Spirit, who cools the flame of our passions
by the “mortification” of our “members.”983</p>
<p>32. What then? Because they were typically baptized unto Moses, is the grace of baptism
therefore small? Were it so, and if we were in each case to prejudice the dignity of our
privileges by comparing them with their types, not even one of these privileges could be
reckoned great; then not the love of God, who gave His only begotten Son for our sins,
would be great and extraordinary, because Abraham did not spare his own son;984 then
even the passion of the Lord would not be glorious, because a sheep typified the offering
instead of Isaac; then the descent into hell was not fearful, because Jonah had previously
typified the death in three days and three nights. The same prejudicial comparison is made
also in the case of baptism by all who judge of the reality by the shadow, and, comparing
the typified with the type, attempt by means of Moses and the sea to disparage at once the
whole dispensation of the Gospel. What remission of sins, what renewal of life, is there in
the sea? What spiritual gift is there through Moses? What dying985 of sins is there? Those
men did not die with Christ; wherefore they were not raised with Him.986 They did not
“bear the image of the heavenly;”987 they did “bear about in the body the dying of Jesus;”988
they did not “put off the old man;” they did not “put on the new man which is renewed in
knowledge after the image of Him which created him.”989 Why then do you compare

baptisms which have only the name in common, while the distinction between the things
themselves is as great as might be that of dream and reality, that of shadow and figures with
substantial existence?</p>
<p>33. But belief in Moses not only does not show our belief in the Spirit to be worthless,
but, if we adopt our opponents’ line of argument, it rather weakens our confession in the
God of the universe. “The people,” it is written, “believed the Lord and his servant
Moses.”990 Moses then is joined with God, not with the Spirit; and he was a type not of the
Spirit, but of Christ. For at that time in the ministry of the law, he by means of himself
typified “the Mediator between God and men.”991 Moses, when mediating for the people
in things pertaining to God, was not a minister of the Spirit; for the law was given, “ordained
by angels in the hand of a mediator,”992 namely Moses, in accordance with the summons
of the people, “Speak thou with us,<gap reason="omitted"/>but let not God speak with us.”993 Thus faith in Moses
is referred to the Lord, the Mediator between God and men, who said, “Had ye believed
Moses, ye would have believed me.”994 Is then our faith in the Lord a trifle, because it was
signified beforehand through Moses? So then, even if men were baptized unto Moses, it
does not follow that the grace given of the Spirit in baptism is small. I may point out, too,
that it is usual in Scripture to say Moses and the law,995 as in the passage, “They have Moses
and the prophets.”996 When therefore it is meant to speak of the baptism of the law, the
words are, “They were baptized unto Moses.”997 Why then do these calumniators of the
truth, by means of the shadow and the types, endeavour to bring contempt and ridicule on
the “rejoicing” of our “hope,”998 and the rich gift of our God and Saviour, who through regeneration
renews our youth like the eagle’s?999 Surely it is altogether childish, and like a
babe who must needs be fed on milk,1000 to be ignorant of the great mystery of our salvation;
inasmuch as, in accordance with the gradual progress of our education, while being brought

in that hence the transition to the wisdom hidden in mystery1003 will be made easy. Enough
so far concerning types; nor indeed would it be possible to linger longer on this topic, or
the incidental discussion would become many times bulkier than the main argument.</p>

<p>Reply to the suggested objection that we are baptized “into water.” Also concerning baptism.</p>
<p>34. What more? Verily, our opponents are well equipped with arguments. We are
baptized, they urge, into water, and of course we shall not honour the water above all creation,
or give it a share of the honour of the Father and of the Son. The arguments of these men
are such as might be expected from angry disputants, leaving no means untried in their attack
on him who has offended them, because their reason is clouded over by their feelings. We
will not, however, shrink from the discussion even of these points. If we do not teach the
ignorant, at least we shall not turn away before evil doers. But let us for a moment retrace
our steps.</p>
<p>35. The dispensation of our God and Saviour concerning man is a recall from the fall
and a return from the alienation caused by disobedience to close communion with God.
This is the reason for the sojourn of Christ in the flesh, the pattern life described in the
Gospels, the sufferings, the cross, the tomb, the resurrection; so that the man who is being
saved through imitation of Christ receives that old adoption. For perfection of life the imitation
of Christ is necessary, not only in the example of gentleness,1004 lowliness, and long
suffering set us in His life, but also of His actual death. So Paul, the imitator of Christ,1005
says, “being made conformable unto his death; if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection
of the dead.”1006 How then are we made in the likeness of His death?1007 In
that we were buried1008 with Him by baptism. What then is the manner of the burial? And
what is the advantage resulting from the imitation? First of all, it is necessary that the continuity
of the old life be cut. And this is impossible unless a man be born again, according
to the Lord’s word;1009 for the regeneration, as indeed the name shews, is a beginning of a
second life. So before beginning the second, it is necessary to put an end to the first. For
just as in the case of runners who turn and take the second course,1010 a kind of halt and
pause intervenes between the movements in the opposite direction, so also in making a

change in lives it seemed necessary for death to come as mediator between the two, ending
all that goes before, and beginning all that comes after. How then do we achieve the descent
into hell? By imitating, through baptism, the burial of Christ. For the bodies of the baptized
are, as it were, buried in the water. Baptism then symbolically signifies the putting off of
the works of the flesh; as the apostle says, ye were “circumcised with the circumcision made
without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ;
buried with him in baptism.”1011 And there is, as it were, a cleansing of the soul from the
filth1012 that has grown on it from the carnal mind,1013 as it is written, “Thou shalt wash
me, and I shall be whiter than snow.”1014 On this account we do not, as is the fashion of
the Jews, wash ourselves at each defilement, but own the baptism of salvation1015 to be
one.1016 For there the death on behalf of the world is one, and one the resurrection of the
dead, whereof baptism is a type. For this cause the Lord, who is the Dispenser of our life,
gave us the covenant of baptism, containing a type of life and death, for the water fulfils the
image of death, and the Spirit gives us the earnest of life. Hence it follows that the answer
to our question why the water was associated with the Spirit1017 is clear: the reason is because
in baptism two ends were proposed; on the one hand, the destroying of the body of sin,1018
that it may never bear fruit unto death;1019 on the other hand, our living unto the Spirit,1020
and having our fruit in holiness;1021 the water receiving the body as in a tomb figures death,
while the Spirit pours in the quickening power, renewing our souls from the deadness of
sin unto their original life. This then is what it is to be born again of water and of the Spirit,
the being made dead being effected in the water, while our life is wrought in us through the
Spirit. In three immersions,1022 then, and with three invocations, the great mystery of

<pb n="188"/>
baptism is performed, to the end that the type of death may be fully figured, and that by the
tradition of the divine knowledge the baptized may have their souls enlightened. It follows
that if there is any grace in the water, it is not of the nature of the water, but of the presence
of the Spirit. For baptism is “not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer
of a good conscience towards God.”1023 So in training us for the life that follows on the
resurrection the Lord sets out all the manner of life required by the Gospel, laying down for
us the law of gentleness, of endurance of wrong, of freedom from the defilement that comes
of the love of pleasure, and from covetousness, to the end that we may of set purpose win
beforehand and achieve all that the life to come of its inherent nature possesses. If therefore
any one in attempting a definition were to describe the gospel as a forecast of the life that
follows on the resurrection, he would not seem to me to go beyond what is meet and right.
Let us now return to our main topic.</p>
<p>36. Through the Holy Spirit comes our restoration to paradise, our ascension into the
kingdom of heaven, our return to the adoption of sons, our liberty to call God our Father,
our being made partakers of the grace of Christ, our being called children of light, our
sharing in eternal glory, and, in a word, our being brought into a state of all “fulness of
blessing,”1024 both in this world and in the world to come, of all the good gifts that are in
store for us, by promise hereof, through faith, beholding the reflection of their grace as
though they were already present, we await the full enjoyment. If such is the earnest, what
the perfection? If such the first fruits, what the complete fulfilment? Furthermore, from
this too may be apprehended the difference between the grace that comes from the Spirit
and the baptism by water: in that John indeed baptized with water, but our Lord Jesus Christ
by the Holy Ghost. “I indeed,” he says, “baptize you with water unto repentance; but he
that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall
baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.”1025 Here He calls the trial at the judgment
the baptism of fire, as the apostle says, “The fire shall try every man’s work, of what sort it
is.”1026 And again, “The day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire.”1027 And
<note type="footnote">Eunomius as abandoning the trine immersion, and also the invocation of the Trinity as baptizing into the death
of Christ. Jeremy Taylor (Ductor dubitantium, iii. 4, Sect. 13) says, “In England we have a custom of sprinkling,
and that but once.…As to the number, though the Church of England hath made no law, and therefore the
custom of doing it once is the more indifferent and at liberty, yet if the trine immersion be agreeable to the
analogy of the mystery, and the other be not, the custom ought not to prevail, and is not to be complied with,
if the case be evident or declared.”</note>

ere now there have been some who in their championship of true religion have undergone
the death for Christ’s sake, not in mere similitude, but in actual fact, and so have needed
none of the outward signs of water for their salvation, because they were baptized in their
own blood.1028 Thus I write not to disparage the baptism by water, but to overthrow the
arguments1029 of those who exalt themselves against the Spirit; who confound things that
are distinct from one another, and compare those which admit of no comparison.</p>
<note type="footnote">1028 On the martyrs’ baptism of blood, cf. Eus. vi. 4, on the martyrdom of the Catechumen Herais. So St.
Cyril, of Jerusalem (Cat. Lect. iii. 10), “If a man receive not baptism, he has not salvation; excepting only the
martyrs, even who without the water receive the kingdom. For when the Saviour was ransoming the world
through the cross, and was pierced in the side, He gave forth blood and water, that some in times of peace should
be baptized in water; others in time of persecution, in their own blood.” So Tertullian (In Valentin. ii.) of the
Holy Innocents, “baptized in blood for Jesus’ sake” (Keble), “testimonium Christi sanguine litavere.”</note>

<p>That the Holy Spirit is in every conception inseparable from the Father and the Son, alike in
the creation of perceptible objects, in the dispensation of human affairs, and in the judgment
to come.</p>
<p>37. Let us then revert to the point raised from the outset, that in all things the Holy
Spirit is inseparable and wholly incapable of being parted from the Father and the Son. St.
Paul, in the passage about the gift of tongues, writes to the Corinthians, “If ye all prophesy
and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is
judged of all; and thus are the secrets of the heart made manifest; and so falling down on
his face he will worship God and report that God is in you of a truth.”1030 If then God is
known to be in the prophets by the prophesying that is acting according to the distribution
of the gifts of the Spirit, let our adversaries consider what kind of place they will attribute
to the Holy Spirit. Let them say whether it is more proper to rank Him with God or to thrust
Him forth to the place of the creature. Peter’s words to Sapphira, “How is it that ye have
agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Ye have not lied unto men, but unto
God,”1031 show that sins against the Holy Spirit and against God are the same; and thus
you might learn that in every operation the Spirit is closely conjoined with, and inseparable
from, the Father and the Son. God works the differences of operations, and the Lord the
diversities of administrations, but all the while the Holy Spirit is present too of His own will,
dispensing distribution of the gifts according to each recipient’s worth. For, it is said, “there
are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit; and differences of administrations, but the same
Lord; and there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in
all.”1032 “But all these,” it is said, “worketh that one and the self-same Spirit, dividing to
every man severally as He will.”1033 It must not however be supposed because in this passage
the apostle names in the first place the Spirit, in the second the Son, and in the third God
the Father, that therefore their rank is reversed. The apostle has only started in accordance
with our habits of thought; for when we receive gifts, the first that occurs to us is the distributer,
next we think of the sender, and then we lift our thoughts to the fountain and cause
of the boons.</p>
<p>38. Moreover, from the things created at the beginning may be learnt the fellowship of
the Spirit with the Father and the Son. The pure, intelligent, and supermundane powers
are and are styled holy, because they have their holiness of the grace given by the Holy

Spirit. Accordingly the mode of the creation of the heavenly powers is passed over in Silence,
for the historian of the cosmogony has revealed to us only the creation of things perceptible
by sense. But do thou, who hast power from the things that are seen to form an analogy of
the unseen, glorify the Maker by whom all things were made, visible and invisible, principalities
and powers, authorities, thrones, and dominions, and all other reasonable natures
whom we cannot name.1034 And in the creation bethink thee first, I pray thee, of the original
cause of all things that are made, the Father; of the creative cause, the Son; of the perfecting
cause, the Spirit; so that the ministering spirits subsist by the will of the Father, are brought
into being by the operation of the Son, and perfected by the presence of the Spirit. Moreover,
the perfection of angels is sanctification and continuance in it. And let no one imagine me
either to affirm that there are three original hypostases1035 or to allege the operation of the
Son to be imperfect. For the first principle of existing things is One, creating through the
Son and perfecting through the Spirit.1036 The operation of the Father who worketh all in
all is not imperfect, neither is the creating work of the Son incomplete if not perfected by
the Spirit. The Father, who creates by His sole will, could not stand in any need of the Son,
but nevertheless He wills through the Son; nor could the Son, who works according to the
likeness of the Father, need co-operation, but the Son too wills to make perfect through the
Spirit. “For by the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of them by the
breath [the Spirit] of His mouth.”1037 The Word then is not a mere significant impression
on the air, borne by the organs of speech; nor is the Spirit of His mouth a vapour, emitted
by the organs of respiration; but the Word is He who “was with God in the beginning” and
“was God,”1038 and the Spirit of the mouth of God is “the Spirit of truth which proceedeth
from the Father.”1039 You are therefore to perceive three, the Lord who gives the order, the
Word who creates, and the Spirit who confirms.1040 And what other thing could confirmation
be than the perfecting according to holiness? This perfecting expresses the confirmation’s
firmness, unchangeableness, and fixity in good. But there is no sanctification without

the Spirit. The powers of the heavens are not holy by nature; were it so there would in this
respect be no difference between them and the Holy Spirit. It is in proportion to their relative
excellence that they have their meed of holiness from the Spirit. The branding-iron is conceived
of together with the fire; and yet the material and the fire are distinct. Thus too in
the case of the heavenly powers; their substance is, peradventure, an aerial spirit, or an immaterial
fire, as it is written, “Who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of
fire;”1041 wherefore they exist in space and become visible, and appear in their proper bodily
form to them that are worthy. But their sanctification, being external to their substance,
superinduces their perfection through the communion of the Spirit. They keep their rank
by their abiding in the good and true, and while they retain their freedom of will, never fall
away from their patient attendance on Him who is truly good. It results that, if by your argument
you do away with the Spirit, the hosts of the angels are disbanded, the dominions
of archangels are destroyed, all is thrown into confusion, and their life loses law, order, and
distinctness. For how are angels to cry “Glory to God in the highest”1042 without being
empowered by the Spirit? For “No man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost,
and no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed;”1043 as might be said by
wicked and hostile spirits, whose fall establishes our statement of the freedom of the will of
the invisible powers; being, as they are, in a condition of equipoise between virtue and vice,
and on this account needing the succour of the Spirit. I indeed maintain that even Gabriel1044
in no other way foretells events to come than by the foreknowledge of the Spirit, by reason
of the fact that one of the boons distributed by the Spirit is prophecy. And whence did he
who was ordained to announce the mysteries of the vision to the Man of Desires1045 derive
the wisdom whereby he was enabled to teach hidden things, if not from the Holy Spirit?
The revelation of mysteries is indeed the peculiar function of the Spirit, as it is written, “God
hath revealed them unto us by His Spirit.”1046 And how could “thrones, dominions, principalities
and powers”1047 live their blessed life, did they not “behold the face of the Father
which is in heaven”?1048 But to behold it is impossible without the Spirit! Just as at night,
if you withdraw the light from the house, the eyes fall blind and their faculties become inactive,
and the worth of objects cannot be discerned, and gold is trodden on in ignorance as

though it were iron, so in the order of the intellectual world it is impossible for the high life
of Law to abide without the Spirit. For it so to abide were as likely as that an army should
maintain its discipline in the absence of its commander, or a chorus its harmony without
the guidance of the Coryphæus. How could the Seraphim cry “Holy, Holy, Holy,”1049 were
they not taught by the Spirit how often true religion requires them to lift their voice in this
ascription of glory? Do “all His angels” and “all His hosts”1050 praise God? It is through
the co-operation of the Spirit. Do “thousand thousand” of angels stand before Him, and
“ten thousand times ten thousand” ministering spirits?1051 They are blamelessly doing their
proper work by the power of the Spirit. All the glorious and unspeakable harmony1052 of
the highest heavens both in the service of God, and in the mutual concord of the celestial
powers, can therefore only be preserved by the direction of the Spirit. Thus with those beings
who are not gradually perfected by increase and advance,1053 but are perfect from the mo-
ment of the creation, there is in creation the presence of the Holy Spirit, who confers on
them the grace that flows from Him for the completion and perfection of their essence.1054</p>
<p>39. But when we speak of the dispensations made for man by our great God and Saviour
Jesus Christ,1055 who will gainsay their having been accomplished through the grace of the
Spirit? Whether you wish to examine ancient evidence;—the blessings of the patriarchs,
the succour given through the legislation, the types, the prophecies, the valorous feats in
war, the signs wrought through just men;—or on the other hand the things done in the
dispensation of the coming of our Lord in the flesh;—all is through the Spirit. In the first
place He was made an unction, and being inseparably present was with the very flesh of the
Lord, according to that which is written, “Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending
and remaining on Him, the same is”1056 “my beloved Son;”1057 and “Jesus of Nazareth”
whom “God anointed with the Holy Ghost.”1058 After this every operation was wrought
with the co-operation of the Spirit. He was present when the Lord was being tempted by

the devil; for, it is said, “Jesus was led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted.”1059
He was inseparably with Him while working His wonderful works;1060 for, it is said, “If I
by the Spirit of God cast out devils.”1061 And He did not leave Him when He had risen
from the dead; for when renewing man, and, by breathing on the face of the disciples,1062
restoring the grace, that came of the inbreathing of God, which man had lost, what did the
Lord say? “Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto
them; and whose soever ye retain, they are retained.”1063 And is it not plain and incontestable
that the ordering of the Church is effected through the Spirit? For He gave, it is said, “in
the church, first Apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then
gifts of healing, helps, governments, diversities of tongues,”1064 for this order is ordained
in accordance with the division of the gifts that are of the Spirit.1065</p>
<p>40. Moreover by any one who carefully uses his reason it will be found that even at the
moment of the expected appearance of the Lord from heaven the Holy Spirit will not, as
some suppose, have no functions to discharge: on the contrary, even in the day of His revelation,
in which the blessed and only potentate1066 will judge the world in righteousness,1067
the Holy Spirit will be present with Him. For who is so ignorant of the good things prepared
by God for them that are worthy, as not to know that the crown of the righteous is the grace
of the Spirit, bestowed in more abundant and perfect measure in that day, when spiritual
glory shall be distributed to each in proportion as he shall have nobly played the man? For

dead.”1069 They, then, that were sealed by the Spirit unto the day of redemption,1070 and
preserve pure and undiminished the first fruits which they received of the Spirit, are they
that shall hear the words “well done thou good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful
over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.”1071 In like manner they which
have grieved the Holy Spirit by the wickedness of their ways, or have not wrought for Him
that gave to them, shall be deprived of what they have received, their grace being transferred
to others; or, according to one of the evangelists, they shall even be wholly cut asunder,
1072—the cutting asunder meaning complete separation from the Spirit. The body is
not divided, part being delivered to chastisement, and part let off; for when a whole has
sinned it were like the old fables, and unworthy of a righteous judge, for only the half to
suffer chastisement. Nor is the soul cut in two,—that soul the whole of which possesses the
sinful affection throughout, and works the wickedness in co-operation with the body. The
cutting asunder, as I have observed, is the separation for aye of the soul from the Spirit. For
now, although the Spirit does not suffer admixture with the unworthy, He nevertheless does
seem in a manner to be present with them that have once been sealed, awaiting the salvation
which follows on their conversion; but then He will be wholly cut off from the soul that has
defiled His grace. For this reason “In Hell there is none that maketh confession; in death
none that remembereth God,”1073 because the succour of the Spirit is no longer present.
How then is it possible to conceive that the judgment is accomplished without the Holy
Spirit, wherein the word points out that He is Himself the prize1074 of the righteous, when
instead of the earnest1075 is given that which is perfect, and the first condemnation of sinners,
when they are deprived of that which they seem to have? But the greatest proof of the conjunction
of the Spirit with the Father and the Son is that He is said to have the same relation
to God which the spirit in us has to each of us. “For what man” it is said, “knoweth the
things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth
no man but the Spirit of God.”1076</p>

<p>Against those who say that the Holy Ghost is not to be numbered with, but numbered under,
the Father and the Son. Wherein moreover there is a summary notice of the faith concerning
right sub-numeration.</p>
<p>41. What, however, they call sub-numeration,1077 and in what sense they use this word,
cannot even be imagined without difficulty. It is well known that it was imported into our
language from the “wisdom of the world;”1078 but a point for our present consideration will
be whether it has any immediate relation to the subject under discussion. Those who are
adepts in vain investigations tell us that, while some nouns are common and of widely extended
denotation, others are more specific, and that the force of some is more limited than
that of others. Essence, for instance, is a common noun, predicable of all things both animate
and inanimate; while animal is more specific, being predicated of fewer subjects than the
former, though of more than those which are considered under it, as it embraces both rational
and irrational nature. Again, human is more specific than animal, and man than
human, and than man the individual Peter, Paul, or John.1079 Do they then mean by subnumeration
the division of the common into its subordinate parts? But I should hesitate
to believe they have reached such a pitch of infatuation as to assert that the God of the universe,
like some common quality conceivable only by reason and without actual existence
in any hypostasis, is divided into subordinate divisions, and that then this subdivision is
called sub-numeration. This would hardly be said even by men melancholy mad, for, besides
its impiety, they are establishing the very opposite argument to their own contention. For
<note type="footnote">1077 “The word was used as a quasi philosophical term to express the doctrine quoted by St. Basil, in § 13:
it does not occur in the confession of Eunomius, which was prepared after this book, a.d. 382; but it was used
by him in his Liber Apologeticus (before a.d. 365) against which St. Basil wrote.” Rev. C.F.H. Johnston. For
“ὑπαρίθμησις” the only authorities given by the lexicons are “ecclesiastical.” But the importation from the “wisdom of the world” implies use in heathen philosophy.</note>
<note type="footnote">1078 cf. 1 Cor. i. 20.</note>
<note type="footnote">1079 “This portion of the theory of general language is the subject of what is termed the doctrine of the Predicables;
a set of distinctions handed down from Aristotle, and his follower Porphyry, many of which have taken
a firm root in scientific, and some of them even in popular, phraseology. The predicables are a five-fold division
of General Names, not grounded as usual on a difference in their meaning, that is, in the attribute which they
connote, but on a difference in the kind of class which they denote. We may predicate of a thing five different
varieties of class-name: A genus of the thing (γένος). A species (εἶδος). A differentia (διαφορα). A proprium
(ἰδιόν). An accidens (συμβεβηκός). It is to be remarked of these distinctions, that they express, not what the
predicate is in its own meaning, but what relation it bears to the subject of which it happens on the particular
occasion to be predicated.” J. S. Mill, System of Logic, i. 133.</note>

<pb n="197"/>
the subdivisions are of the same essence as that from which they have been divided. The
very obviousness of the absurdity makes it difficult for us to find arguments to confute their
unreasonableness; so that really their folly looks like an advantage to them; just as soft and
yielding bodies offer no resistance, and therefore cannot be struck a stout blow. It is impossible
to bring a vigorous confutation to bear on a palpable absurdity. The only course
open to us is to pass by their abominable impiety in silence. Yet our love for the brethren
and the importunity of our opponents makes silence impossible.</p>
<p>42. What is it that they maintain? Look at the terms of their imposture. “We assert
that connumeration is appropriate to subjects of equal dignity, and sub-numeration to those
which vary in the direction of inferiority.” “Why,” I rejoined, “do you say this? I fail to
understand your extraordinary wisdom. Do you mean that gold is numbered with gold,
and that lead is unworthy of the connumeration, but, because of the cheapness of the material,
is subnumerated to gold? And do you attribute so much importance to number as that
it can either exalt the value of what is cheap, or destroy the dignity of what is valuable?
Therefore, again, you will number gold under precious stones, and such precious stones as
are smaller and without lustre under those which are larger and brighter in colour. But
what will not be said by men who spend their time in nothing else but either ‘to tell or to
hear some new thing’?1080 Let these supporters of impiety be classed for the future with
Stoics and Epicureans. What sub-numeration is even possible of things less valuable in relation
to things very valuable? How is a brass obol to be numbered under a golden stater?
“Because,” they reply, “we do not speak of possessing two coins, but one and one.” But
which of these is subnumerated to the other? Each is similarly mentioned. If then you
number each by itself, you cause an equality of value by numbering them in the same way
but, if you join them, you make their value one by numbering them one with the other. But
if the sub-numeration belongs to the one which is numbered second, then it is in the power
of the counter to begin by counting the brass coin. Let us, however, pass over the confutation
of their ignorance, and turn our argument to the main topic.</p>
<p>43. Do you maintain that the Son is numbered under the Father, and the Spirit under
the Son, or do you confine your sub-numeration to the Spirit alone? If, on the other hand,
you apply this sub-numeration also to the Son, you revive what is the same impious doctrine,
the unlikeness of the substance, the lowliness of rank, the coming into being in later time,
and once for all, by this one term, you will plainly again set circling all the blasphemies
against the Only-begotten. To controvert these blasphemies would be a longer task than
my present purpose admits of; and I am the less bound to undertake it because the impiety
has been refuted elsewhere to the best of my ability.1081 If on the other hand they suppose

<note type="footnote">1081 i.e. in the second book of his work against Eunomius.</note>

<pb n="198"/>
the sub-numeration to benefit the Spirit alone, they must be taught that the Spirit is spoken
of together with the Lord in precisely the same manner in which the Son is spoken of with
the Father. “The name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost”1082 is delivered
in like manner, and, according to the co-ordination of words delivered in baptism, the relation
of the Spirit to the Son is the same as that of the Son to the Father. And if the Spirit is coordinate
with the Son, and the Son with the Father, it is obvious that the Spirit is also coordinate
with the Father. When then the names are ranked in one and the same co-ordinate
series,1083 what room is there for speaking on the one hand of connumeration, and on the
other of sub-numeration? Nay, without exception, what thing ever lost its own nature by
being numbered? Is it not the fact that things when numbered remain what they naturally
and originally were, while number is adopted among us as a sign indicative of the plurality
of subjects? For some bodies we count, some we measure, and some we weigh;1084 those
which are by nature continuous we apprehend by measure; to those which are divided we
apply number (with the exception of those which on account of their fineness are measured);
while heavy objects are distinguished by the inclination of the balance. It does not however
follow that, because we have invented for our convenience symbols to help us to arrive at
the knowledge of quantity, we have therefore changed the nature of the things signified.
We do not speak of “weighing under” one another things which are weighed, even though
one be gold and the other tin; nor yet do we “measure under” things that are measured; and
so in the same way we will not “number under” things which are numbered. And if none
of the rest of things admits of sub-numeration how can they allege that the Spirit ought to
be subnumerated? Labouring as they do under heathen unsoundness, they imagine that
things which are inferior, either by grade of rank or subjection of substance, ought to be
subnumerated.</p>

nor yet “into one, two, and three, but He gave us the boon of the knowledge of the faith
<note type="footnote">1085 The term Μοναρχία first acquired importance in patristic literature in Justin’s work De monarchia,
against Polytheism. Of the lost letter of Irenæus to the Roman Presbyter Florinus, who was deposed for heresy,
presumably gnostic, the title, according to Eusebius (H.E. v. 20), was περὶ Μοναρχίας, ἢ περὶ τοῦ μὴ εἶναι τὸν
θεὸν ποιητὴν κακῶν. Later it came to be used to express not the Divine unity as opposed to Polytheism or
Oriental Dualism, but the Divine unity as opposed to Tritheism. Vide the words of Dionysius of Rome, as
quoted by Athan. De Decretis, § 26, “Next let me turn to those who cut in pieces, divide, and destroy that most
sacred doctrine of the church of God, the divine Monarchy, making it, as it were, three powers and divided
subsistences and three godheads.” So St. Basil Cont. Eunom. ii. ᾽Αρχὴ μὲν οὖν πατρὸς οὐδεμία, ἀρχὴ δὲ τοῦ υἱοῦ
ὁ πατήρ. And in Ep. xxxviii. ᾽Αλλά τίς ἐστι δύναμις ἀγεννήτως καὶ ἀνάρχως ὑφεοτῶσα ἥτις ἐςτὶν αἰτία τῆς
ἁπάντων τῶν ὄντων αἰτίας, ἐκ γὰρ τοῦ πατρὸς ὁ υἱU+0026 232·ς δι᾽ οὗ τὰ πάντα. And in Ep. cxxv. Ενα γὰρ οἴδαμεν
ἀγέννητον καὶ μίαν τῶν πάντων ἀρχὴν, τὸν πατέρα τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν ᾽Ιησοῦ Χριστοῦ. On the doctrine and
its exponents compare § 72 of the De Sp. S. On the other hand “Monarchians” was a name connoting heresy
when applied to those who pushed the doctrine of the Unity to an extreme, involving denial of a Trinity. Of
these, among the more noteworthy were Paul of Samosata, bp. of Antioch, who was deposed in 269, a representative
of thinkers who have been called dynamical monarchians, and Praxeas (supposed by some to be a nickname),
who taught at Rome in the reign of Marcus Aurelius, and of whom Tertullian, the originator of the term patripassians,
as applied to Monarchians, wrote “Paracletum fugavit et patrem crucifixit.” This heretical Monarchianism
culminated in Sabellius, the “most original, ingenious, and profound of the Monarchians.” Schaff. Hist.

<note type="footnote">1087 Mr. C.F.H. Johnston quotes as instances of the application of the word “third” to the Holy Ghost; Justin
Martyr (Apol. i. 13) “We honour the Spirit of prophecy in the third rank.” Tertullian (In Prax. 8) “As the fruit
from the tree is third from the root, and the rivulet from the river third from the source, and the flame from the
ray third from the sun.” Eunomius (Lib. Apol. § 25) “observing the teaching of Saints, we have learned from
them that the Holy Spirit is third in dignity and order, and so have believed him to be third in nature also.” On
the last St. Basil (Adv. Eunom. ii.) rejoins “Perhaps the word of piety allows Him to come in rank second to the
Son…although He is inferior to the Son in rank and dignity (that we may make the utmost possible concession)</note>

which leads to salvation, by means of holy names. So that what saves us is our faith.
Number has been devised as a symbol indicative of the quantity of objects. But these men,
who bring ruin on themselves from every possible source, have turned even the capacity
for counting against the faith. Nothing else undergoes any change in consequence of the
addition of number, and yet these men in the case of the divine nature pay reverence to
number, lest they should exceed the limits of the honour due to the Paraclete. But, O wisest
sirs, let the unapproachable be altogether above and beyond number, as the ancient reverence
of the Hebrews wrote the unutterable name of God in peculiar characters, thus endeavouring
to set forth its infinite excellence. Count, if you must; but you must not by counting do
damage to the faith. Either let the ineffable be honoured by silence; or let holy things be
counted consistently with true religion. There is one God and Father, one Only-begotten,
and one Holy Ghost. We proclaim each of the hypostases singly; and, when count we must,
we do not let an ignorant arithmetic carry us away to the idea of a plurality of Gods.</p>
<p>45. For we do not count by way of addition, gradually making increase from unity to
multitude, and saying one, two, and three,—nor yet first, second, and third. For “I,” God,
“am the first, and I am the last.”1088 And hitherto we have never, even at the present time,
heard of a second God. Worshipping as we do God of God, we both confess the distinction
of the Persons, and at the same time abide by the Monarchy. We do not fritter away the
theology1089 in a divided plurality, because one Form, so to say, united1090 in the invariableness
of the Godhead, is beheld in God the Father, and in God the Only begotten. For the
Son is in the Father and the Father in the Son; since such as is the latter, such is the former,
and such as is the former, such is the latter; and herein is the Unity. So that according to
the distinction of Persons, both are one and one, and according to the community of Nature,
one. How, then, if one and one, are there not two Gods? Because we speak of a king, and
of the king’s image, and not of two kings. The majesty is not cloven in two, nor the glory
divided. The sovereignty and authority over us is one, and so the doxology ascribed by us
is not plural but one;1091 because the honour paid to the image passes on to the prototype.
Now what in the one case the image is by reason of imitation, that in the other case the Son
is by nature; and as in works of art the likeness is dependent on the form, so in the case of

the divine and uncompounded nature the union consists in the communion of the Godhead.
1092 One, moreover, is the Holy Spirit, and we speak of Him singly, conjoined as He
is to the one Father through the one Son, and through Himself completing the adorable and
blessed Trinity. Of Him the intimate relationship to the Father and the Son is sufficiently
declared by the fact of His not being ranked in the plurality of the creation, but being spoken
of singly; for he is not one of many, but One. For as there is one Father and one Son, so is
there one Holy Ghost. He is consequently as far removed from created Nature as reason
requires the singular to be removed from compound and plural bodies; and He is in such
wise united to the Father and to the Son as unit has affinity with unit.</p>
<p>46. And it is not from this source alone that our proofs of the natural communion are
derived, but from the fact that He is moreover said to be “of God;”1093 not indeed in the
sense in which “all things are of God,”1094 but in the sense of proceeding out of God, not
by generation, like the Son, but as Breath of His mouth. But in no way is the “mouth” a
member, nor the Spirit breath that is dissolved; but the word “mouth” is used so far as it
can be appropriate to God, and the Spirit is a Substance having life, gifted with supreme
power of sanctification. Thus the close relation is made plain, while the mode of the ineffable
existence is safeguarded. He is moreover styled ‘Spirit of Christ,’ as being by nature closely
related to Him. Wherefore “If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.”1095
Hence He alone worthily glorifies the Lord, for, it is said, “He shall glorify me,”1096 not as
the creature, but as “Spirit of truth,”1097 clearly shewing forth the truth in Himself, and, as
Spirit of wisdom, in His own greatness revealing “Christ the Power of God and the wisdom
of God.”1098 And as Paraclete1099 He expresses in Himself the goodness of the Paraclete

There is then on the one hand a natural glory, as light is the glory of the sun; and
on the other a glory bestowed judicially and of free will ‘ab extra’ on them that are worthy.
The latter is twofold. “A son,” it is said, “honoureth his father, and a servant his master.”1100
Of these two the one, the servile, is given by the creature; the other, which may be called the
intimate, is fulfilled by the Spirit. For, as our Lord said of Himself, “I have glorified Thee
on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do;”1101 so of the Paraclete
He says “He shall glorify me: for He shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you.”1102
And as the Son is glorified of the Father when He says “I have both glorified it and will
glorify it1103again,”1104 so is the Spirit glorified through His communion with both Father
and Son, and through the testimony of the Only-begotten when He says “All manner of sin
and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall
not be forgiven unto men.”1105</p>
<p>47. And when, by means of the power that enlightens us, we fix our eyes on the beauty
of the image of the invisible God, and through the image are led up to the supreme beauty
of the spectacle of the archetype, then, I ween, is with us inseparably the Spirit of knowledge,

hand. St. Basil’s avoidance of direct citation of the verb ἐκπορεύεται, his close connexion of τοῦ ἀποστείλαντος
with ὅθεν προῆλθεν, and the close of the verse in St. John’s gospel ἐκεῖνος μαρτυρήσει περὶ ἐμοῦ, suggest that
the μεγαλωσύνη in St. Basil’s mind may be the μεγαλωσύνη of the Son. At the same time, while the Western
Church was in the main unanimous as to the double procession, this passage from St. Basil is not quoted as an
exception to the general current of the teaching of the Greek Fathers, who, as Bp. Pearson expresses it, “stuck
more closely to the phrase and language of the Scriptures, saying that the spirit proceedeth from the Father.”

in Himself bestowing on them that love the vision of the truth the power of beholding the
Image, not making the exhibition from without, but in Himself leading on to the full
knowledge. “No man knoweth the Father save the Son.”1106 And so “no man can say that
Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost.”1107 For it is not said through the Spirit, but by
the Spirit, and “God is a spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and
in truth,”1108 as it is written “in thy light shall we see light,”1109 namely by the illumination
of the Spirit, “the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.”1110 It
results that in Himself He shows the glory of the Only begotten, and on true worshippers
He in Himself bestows the knowledge of God. Thus the way of the knowledge of God lies
from One Spirit through the One Son to the One Father, and conversely the natural Goodness
and the inherent Holiness and the royal Dignity extend from the Father through the Only-
begotten to the Spirit. Thus there is both acknowledgment of the hypostases and the true
dogma of the Monarchy is not lost.1111 They on the other hand who support their subnumeration
by talking of first and second and third ought to be informed that into the undefiled
theology of Christians they are importing the polytheism of heathen error. No other
result can be achieved by the fell device of sub-numeration than the confession of a first, a
second, and a third God. For us is sufficient the order prescribed by the Lord. He who
confuses this order will be no less guilty of transgressing the law than are the impious heathen.</p>
<p>Enough has been now said to prove, in contravention of their error, that the communion
of Nature is in no wise dissolved by the manner of sub-numeration. Let us, however, make
a concession to our contentious and feeble minded adversary, and grant that what is second
to anything is spoken of in sub-numeration to it. Now let us see what follows. “The first

believe in δύο ἄναρχοι; we, in effect, believe in two Gods. The unity of the Godhead can only be maintained by
acknowledging the Father to be the sole ᾽Αρχὴ or πηγὴ θεοτήτος, who from all eternity has communicated His
own Godhead to His co-eternal and consubstantial Son and Spirit. This reasoning is generally true. But, as the
doctrine of the Procession of the Spirit from the Father and the Son presupposes the eternal generation of the
Son from the Father; it does not follow, that that doctrine impugns the Catholic belief in the Μία ᾽Αρχή.” Bp.

<p>Against those who assert that the Spirit ought not to be glorified.</p>
<p>48. “Be it so,” it is rejoined, “but glory is by no means so absolutely due to the Spirit as
to require His exaltation by us in doxologies.” Whence then could we get demonstrations
of the dignity of the Spirit, “passing all understanding,”1114 if His communion with the
Father and the Son were not reckoned by our opponents as good for testimony of His rank?
It is, at all events, possible for us to arrive to a certain extent at intelligent apprehension of
the sublimity of His nature and of His unapproachable power, by looking at the meaning
of His title, and at the magnitude of His operations, and by His good gifts bestowed on us
or rather on all creation. He is called Spirit, as “God is a Spirit,”1115 and “the breath of our
nostrils, the anointed of the Lord.”1116 He is called holy,1117 as the Father is holy, and the
Son is holy, for to the creature holiness was brought in from without, but to the Spirit holiness
is the fulfilment of nature, and it is for this reason that He is described not as being sanctified,
but as sanctifying. He is called good,1118 as the Father is good, and He who was begotten
of the Good is good, and to the Spirit His goodness is essence. He is called upright,1119 as
“the Lord is upright,”1120 in that He is Himself truth,1121 and is Himself Righteousness,1122
having no divergence nor leaning to one side or to the other, on account of the immutability
of His substance. He is called Paraclete, like the Only begotten, as He Himself says, “I will
ask the Father, and He will give you another comforter.”1123 Thus names are borne by the
Spirit in common with the Father and the Son, and He gets these titles from His natural and
close relationship. From what other source could they be derived? Again He is called royal,
1124 Spirit of truth,1125 and Spirit of wisdom.1126 “The Spirit of God,” it is said “hath

and knowledge.”1128 Such names as these are super-eminent and mighty, but they do not
transcend His glory.</p>
<p>49. And His operations, what are they? For majesty ineffable, and for numbers innumerable.
How shall we form a conception of what extends beyond the ages? What were
His operations before that creation whereof we can conceive? How great the grace which
He conferred on creation? What the power exercised by Him over the ages to come? He
existed; He pre-existed; He co-existed with the Father and the Son before the ages. It follows
that, even if you can conceive of anything beyond the ages, you will find the Spirit yet further
above and beyond. And if you think of the creation, the powers of the heavens were estab
lished by the Spirit,1129 the establishment being understood to refer to disability to fall away
from good. For it is from the Spirit that the powers derive their close relationship to God,
their inability to change to evil, and their continuance in blessedness. Is it Christ’s advent?
The Spirit is forerunner. Is there the incarnate presence? The Spirit is inseparable. Working
of miracles, and gifts of healing are through the Holy Spirit. Demons were driven out by
the Spirit of God. The devil was brought to naught by the presence of the Spirit. Remission
of sins was by the gift of the Spirit, for “ye were washed, ye were sanctified,…in the name
of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the holy Spirit of our God.”1130 There is close relationship
with God through the Spirit, for “God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts,
crying Abba, Father.”1131 The resurrection from the dead is effected by the operation of
the Spirit, for “Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created; and Thou renewest the face
of the earth.”1132 If here creation may be taken to mean the bringing of the departed to life
again, how mighty is not the operation of the Spirit, Who is to us the dispenser of the life
that follows on the resurrection, and attunes our souls to the spiritual life beyond? Or if
here by creation is meant the change to a better condition of those who in this life have
fallen into sin, (for it is so understood according to the usage of Scripture, as in the words
of Paul “if any man be in Christ he is a new creature”1133), the renewal which takes place
in this life, and the transmutation from our earthly and sensuous life to the heavenly conversation
which takes place in us through the Spirit, then our souls are exalted to the highest
pitch of admiration. With these thoughts before us are we to be afraid of going beyond due

we seem to give Him the highest names which the thoughts of man can conceive or man’s
tongue utter, we let our thoughts about Him fall too low?</p>
<p>It is the Spirit which says, as the Lord says, “Get thee down, and go with them, doubting
nothing: for I have sent them.”1134 Are these the words of an inferior, or of one in dread?
“Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.”1135 Does a
slave speak thus? And Isaiah, “The Lord God and His Spirit hath sent me,”1136 and “the
Spirit came down from the Lord and guided them.”1137 And pray do not again understand
by this guidance some humble service, for the Word witnesses that it was the work of
God;—“Thou leddest thy people,” it is said “like a flock,”1138 and “Thou that leadest Joseph
like a flock,”1139 and “He led them on safely, so that they feared not.”1140 Thus when you
hear that when the Comforter is come, He will put you in remembrance, and “guide you
into all truth,”1141 do not misrepresent the meaning.</p>
<p>50. But, it is said that “He maketh intercession for us.”1142 It follows then that, as the
suppliant is inferior to the benefactor, so far is the Spirit inferior in dignity to God. But

gives Spiritum suum. The Targum has the same. St. Ambrose writes: ‘Quis est qui dicit; misit me Dominus Deus
et Spiritus Ejus; nisi Qui venit a Patre, ut salvos faceret peccatores? Quem ut audis, et Spiritus misit; ne cum legis
quia Filius Spiritum mittit, inferioris esse Spiritum crederes potestatis,’ (De Sp. S. iii. 1, § 7.) The passage is quoted
by St. Athanasius, St. Basil, St. Cyril Hieros., and, as far as the editor is aware, without any comment which
would help to determine their way of understanding the case of τὸ πνεῦμα; but Origen, on the words ‘Whosoever
shall humble himself as this little child’ (Comm. in Evang., Matt. xiii. 18) says,—quoting the original, which may
be rendered, “‘humbling himself as this little child is imitating the Holy Spirit, who humbled Himself for men’s
salvation. That the Saviour and the Holy Ghost were sent by the Father for the salvation of men is made plain
by Isaiah saying, in the person of the Saviour, ‘the Lord sent me, and His Spirit.’ It must be observed, however,
that the phrase is ambiguous, for either God sent and the Holy Ghost also sent, the Saviour; or, as I understand,
the Father sent both, the Saviour and the Holy Ghost.’” The Vulgate and Beza both render “Spiritus.” The order
of the Hebrew is in favour of the nominative, as in the Vulgate and lxx. cf. Note A on Chap. xlviii. of Isaiah in

have you never heard concerning the Only-begotten that He “is at the right hand of God,
who also maketh intercession for us”?1143 Do not, then, because the Spirit is in you,—if
indeed He is at all in you,—nor yet because He teaches us who were blinded, and guides us
to the choice of what profits us,—do not for this reason allow yourself to be deprived of the
right and holy opinion concerning Him. For to make the loving kindness of your benefactor
a ground of ingratitude were indeed a very extravagance of unfairness. “Grieve not the Holy
Spirit;”1144 hear the words of Stephen, the first fruits of the martyrs, when he reproaches
the people for their rebellion and disobedience; “you do always,” he says, “resist the Holy
Ghost;”1145 and again Isaiah,—“They vexed His Holy Spirit, therefore He was turned to be
their enemy;”1146 and in another passage, “the house of Jacob angered the Spirit of the
Lord.”1147 Are not these passages indicative of authoritative power? I leave it to the judgment
of my readers to determine what opinions we ought to hold when we hear these passages;
whether we are to regard the Spirit as an instrument, a subject, of equal rank with the creature,
and a fellow servant of ourselves, or whether, on the contrary, to the ears of the pious the
mere whisper of this blasphemy is not most grievous. Do you call the Spirit a servant? But,
it is said, “the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth,”1148 and yet the Spirit knoweth
the things of God, as “the spirit of man that is in him.”1149</p>

<p>Against those who maintain that the Spirit is in the rank neither of a servant nor of a
master, but in that of the free.</p>
<p>51. He is not a slave, it is said; not a master, but free. Oh the terrible insensibility, the
pitiable audacity, of them that maintain this! Shall I rather lament in them their ignorance
or their blasphemy? They try to insult the doctrines that concern the divine nature1150 by
comparing them with the human, and endeavour to apply to the ineffable nature of God
that common custom of human life whereby the difference of degrees is variable, not perceiving
that among men no one is a slave by nature. For men are either brought under a
yoke of slavery by conquest, as when prisoners are taken in war; or they are enslaved on
account of poverty, as the Egyptians were oppressed by Pharaoh; or, by a wise and mysterious
dispensation, the worst children are by their fathers’ order condemned to serve the wiser
and the better;1151 and this any righteous enquirer into the circumstances would declare to
be not a sentence of condemnation but a benefit. For it is more profitable that the man
who, through lack of intelligence, has no natural principle of rule within himself, should
become the chattel of another, to the end that, being guided by the reason of his master, he
may be like a chariot with a charioteer, or a boat with a steersman seated at the tiller. For
this reason Jacob by his father’s blessing became lord of Esau,1152 in order that the foolish
son, who had not intelligence, his proper guardian, might, even though he wished it not, be
benefited by his prudent brother. So Canaan shall be “a servant unto his brethren”1153 because,
since his father Ham was unwise, he was uninstructed in virtue. In this world, then,
it is thus that men are made slaves, but they who have escaped poverty or war, or do not
require the tutelage of others, are free. It follows that even though one man be called master
and another servant, nevertheless, both in view of our mutual equality of rank and as chattels
of our Creator, we are all fellow slaves. But in that other world what can you bring out of
bondage? For no sooner were they created than bondage was commenced. The heavenly
bodies exercise no rule over one another, for they are unmoved by ambition, but all bow
down to God, and render to Him alike the awe which is due to Him as Master and the glory
which falls to Him as Creator. For “a son honoureth his father and a servant his master,”1154
and from all God asks one of these two things; for “if I then be a Father where is my honour?
and if I be a Master where is my fear?”1155 Otherwise the life of all men, if it were not under

the oversight of a master, would be most pitiable; as is the condition of the apostate powers
who, because they stiffen their neck against God Almighty, fling off the reins of their
bondage,—not that their natural constitution is different; but the cause is in their disobedient
disposition to their Creator. Whom then do you call free? Him who has no King? Him
who has neither power to rule another nor willingness to be ruled? Among all existent beings
no such nature is to be found. To entertain such a conception of the Spirit is obvious blasphemy.
If He is a creature of course He serves with all the rest, for “all things,” it is said “are
thy servants,”1156 but if He is above Creation, then He shares in royalty.1157</p>
<note type="footnote">1156 Ps. cxix. 91.</note>
<note type="footnote">1157 St. Basil’s view of slavery is that (a) as regards our relation to God, all created beings are naturally in a
condition of subservience to the Creator; (b) as regards our relationship to one another, slavery is not of nature,
but of convention and circumstance. How far he is here at variance with the well known account of slavery
given by Aristotle in the first book of the Politics will depend upon the interpretation we put upon the word
“nature.” “Is there,” asks Aristotle, “any one intended by nature to be a slave, and for whom such a condition
is expedient and right, or rather is not all slavery a violation of nature? There is no difficulty in answering this
question, on grounds both of reason and fact. For that some should rule, and others be ruled, is a thing not only
necessary, but expedient; from the hour of their birth some are marked out for subjection, others for rule.…Where,
then, there is such a difference as that between soul and body, or between men and animals (as in the case of
those whose business it is to use their body, and who can do nothing better), the lower sort are by nature slaves,
and it is better for them, as for all inferiors, that they should be under the rule of a master.…It is clear, then, that
some men are by nature free and others slaves, and that for these latter slavery is both expedient and right.”
Politics, Bk. 1, Sec. 5. Here by Nature seems to be meant something like Basil’s “lack of intelligence,” and of the
τὸ κατὰ φύσιν ἄρχον, which makes it “profitable” for one man to be the chattel of another (κτῆμα is livestock,
especially mancipium. cf. Shakespeare’s K. and Pet., “She is my goods, my chattels.” “Chattel” is a doublet of
“cattle”). St. Basil and Aristotle are at one as to the advantage to the weak slave of his having a powerful protector;
and this, no doubt, is the point of view from which slavery can be best apologized for. Christianity did indeed
do much to better the condition of the slave by asserting his spiritual freedom, but at first it did little more than
emphasize the latter philosophy of heathendom, εἰ σῶμα δοῦλον, ἀλλ᾽ ὁ νοῦς ἐλεύθερος (Soph., frag. incert.
xxii.), and gave the highest meaning to such thoughts as those expressed in the late Epigram of Damascius (c.
530) on a dead slave: Ζωσίμη ἡ πρὶν ἐοῦσα μόνῳ τῷ σώματι δούλη, Καὶ τῷ σώματι νῦν εὗρεν ἐλευθερίην. It is
thought less of a slave’s servitude to fellow man than of the slavery of bond and free alike to evil. cf. Aug., De
Civit. Dei. iv. cap. iii. “Bonus etiamsi serviat liber est: malus autem si regnat servus est: nec est unius hominis,
sed quod gravius est tot dominorum quot vitiorum.” Chrysostom even explains St. Paul’s non-condemnation of
slavery on the ground that its existence, with that of Christian liberty, was a greater moral triumph than its abolition.
(In Genes. Serm. v. 1.) Even so late as the sixth century the legislation of Justinian, though protective,
supposed no natural liberty. “Expedit enim respublicæ ne quis re suâ utatur male.” Instit. i. viii. quoted by Milman,
Lat. Christ. ii. 14. We must not therefore be surprised at not finding in a Father of the fourth century an anticipation
of a later development of Christian sentiment. At the same time it was in the age of St. Basil that “the</note>

<p>Proof from Scripture that the Spirit is called Lord.</p>
<p>52. But why get an unfair victory for our argument by fighting over these undignified
questions, when it is within our power to prove that the excellence of the glory is beyond
dispute by adducing more lofty considerations? If, indeed, we repeat what we have been
taught by Scripture, every one of the Pneumatomachi will peradventure raise a loud and
vehement outcry, stop their ears, pick up stones or anything else that comes to hand for a
weapon, and charge against us. But our own security must not be regarded by us before the
truth. We have learnt from the Apostle, “the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God
and into the patient waiting for Christ”1158 for our tribulations. Who is the Lord that directs
into the love of God and into the patient waiting for Christ for tribulations? Let those men
answer us who are for making a slave of the Holy Spirit. For if the argument had been about
God the Father, it would certainly have said, ‘the Lord direct you into His own love,’ or if
about the Son, it would have added ‘into His own patience.’ Let them then seek what other
Person there is who is worthy to be honoured with the title of Lord. And parallel with this
is that other passage, “and the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward
another, and toward all men, even as we do towards you; to the end He may establish your
hearts unblamable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ with all His saints.”1159 Now what Lord does he entreat to stablish the hearts of the
faithful at Thessalonica, unblamable in holiness before God even our Father, at the coming
of our Lord? Let those answer who place the Holy Ghost among the ministering spirits that
are sent forth on service. They cannot. Wherefore let them hear yet another testimony
which distinctly calls the Spirit Lord. “The Lord,” it is said, “is that Spirit;” and again “even
<note type="footnote">language of the Fathers assumes a bolder tone” (cf. Dict. Christ. Ant. ii. 1905), and “in the correspondence of
Gregory Nazianzen we find him referring to a case where a slave had been made bishop over a small community
in the desert. The Christian lady to whom he belonged endeavoured to assert her right of ownership, for which
she was severely rebuked by St. Basil (cf. Letter CXV.) After St. Basil’s death she again claimed the slave,
whereupon Gregory addressed her a letter of grave remonstrance at her unchristian desire to recall his brother

as from the Lord the Spirit.”1160 But to leave no ground for objection, I will quote the actual
words of the Apostle;—“For even unto this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in
the reading of the Old Testament, which veil is done away in Christ.<gap reason="omitted"/>Nevertheless, when
it shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. Now the Lord is that Spirit.”1161 Why
does he speak thus? Because he who abides in the bare sense of the letter, and in it busies
himself with the observances of the Law, has, as it were, got his own heart enveloped in the
Jewish acceptance of the letter, like a veil; and this befalls him because of his ignorance that
the bodily observance of the Law is done away by the presence of Christ, in that for the future
the types are transferred to the reality. Lamps are made needless by the advent of the sun;
and, on the appearance of the truth, the occupation of the Law is gone, and prophecy is
hushed into silence. He, on the contrary, who has been empowered to look down into the
depth of the meaning of the Law, and, after passing through the obscurity of the letter, as
through a veil, to arrive within things unspeakable, is like Moses taking off the veil when he
spoke with God. He, too, turns from the letter to the Spirit. So with the veil on the face of
Moses corresponds the obscurity of the teaching of the Law, and spiritual contemplation
with the turning to the Lord. He, then, who in the reading of the Law takes away the letter
and turns to the Lord,—and the Lord is now called the Spirit,—becomes moreover like
Moses, who had his face glorified by the manifestation of God. For just as objects which lie
near brilliant colours are themselves tinted by the brightness which is shed around, so is he
who fixes his gaze firmly on the Spirit by the Spirit’s glory somehow transfigured into
greater splendour, having his heart lighted up, as it were, by some light streaming from the
truth of the Spirit.1162 And, this is “being changed from1163 the glory” of the Spirit “into”
His own “glory,” not in niggard degree, nor dimly and indistinctly, but as we might expect
any one to be who is enlightened by1164 the Spirit. Do you not, O man, fear the Apostle
when he says “Ye are the temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you”?1165 Could
he ever have brooked to honour with the title of “temple” the quarters of a slave? How can
he who calls Scripture “God-inspired,”1166 because it was written through the inspiration
of the Spirit, use the language of one who insults and belittles Him?</p>

He says, “the world hath not known Thee,”1168 meaning here by the world not the complex
whole compounded of heaven and earth, but this life of ours subject to death,1169 and exposed
to innumerable vicissitudes. And when discoursing of Himself He says, “Yet a little while
and the world seeth me no more, but ye see me;”1170 again in this passage, applying the
word world to those who being bound down by this material and carnal life, and beholding1171
the truth by material sight alone,1172 were ordained, through their unbelief in the
resurrection, to see our Lord no more with the eyes of the heart. And He said the same
concerning the Spirit. “The Spirit of truth,” He says, “whom the world cannot receive, because
it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him: but ye know Him, for He dwelleth with
you.”1173 For the carnal man, who has never trained his mind to contemplation,1174 but
rather keeps it buried deep in lust of the flesh,1175 as in mud, is powerless to look up to the
spiritual light of the truth. And so the world, that is life enslaved by the affections of the
flesh, can no more receive the grace of the Spirit than a weak eye the light of a sunbeam.
But the Lord, who by His teaching bore witness to purity of life, gives to His disciples the
power of now both beholding and contemplating the Spirit. For “now,” He says, “Ye are

<p>The glorifying of the enumeration of His attributes.</p>
<p>54.1179 Now of the rest of the Powers each is believed to be in a circumscribed place.
The angel who stood by Cornelius1180 was not at one and the same moment with Philip;1181
nor yet did the angel who spoke with Zacharias from the altar at the same time occupy his
own post in heaven. But the Spirit is believed to have been operating at the same time in
Habakkuk and in Daniel at Babylon,1182 and to have been at the prison with Jeremiah,1183
and with Ezekiel at the Chebar.1184 For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world,1185 and
“whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?”1186 And, in
the words of the Prophet, “For I am with you, saith the Lord<gap reason="omitted"/>and my spirit remaineth
among you.”1187 But what nature is it becoming to assign to Him who is omnipresent, and
exists together with God? The nature which is all-embracing, or one which is confined to
particular places, like that which our argument shews the nature of angels to be? No one
would so say. Shall we not then highly exalt Him who is in His nature divine, in His greatness
infinite, in His operations powerful, in the blessings He confers, good? Shall we not give
Him glory? And I understand glory to mean nothing else than the enumeration of the
wonders which are His own. It follows then that either we are forbidden by our antagonists
even to mention the good things which flow to us from Him. or on the other hand that the
mere recapitulation of His attributes is the fullest possible attribution of glory. For not even
in the case of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ and of the Only begotten Son,

<p>Proof of the absurdity of the refusal to glorify the Spirit, from the comparison of things glorified
in creation.</p>
<p>55. Furthermore man is “crowned with glory and honour,”1188 and “glory, honour and
peace” are laid up by promise “to every man that worketh good.”1189 There is moreover a
special and peculiar glory for Israelites “to whom,” it is said “pertaineth the adoption and
the glory<gap reason="omitted"/>and the service,”1190 and the Psalmist speaks of a certain glory of his own, “that
my glory may sing praise to Thee1191;” and again “Awake up my glory”1192 and according
to the Apostle there is a certain glory of sun and moon and stars,1193 and “the ministration
of condemnation is glorious.”1194 While then so many things are glorified, do you wish the
Spirit alone of all things to be unglorified? Yet the Apostle says “the ministration of the
Spirit is glorious.”1195 How then can He Himself be unworthy of glory? How according
to the Psalmist can the glory of the just man be great1196 and according to you the glory of
the Spirit none? How is there not a plain peril from such arguments of our bringing on
ourselves the sin from which there is no escape? If the man who is being saved by works of
righteousness glorifies even them that fear the Lord1197 much less would he deprive the
Spirit of the glory which is His due.</p>
<p>Grant, they say, that He is to be glorified, but not with the Father and the Son. But what
reason is there in giving up the place appointed by the Lord for the Spirit, and inventing
some other? What reason is there for robbing of His share of glory Him Who is everywhere
associated with the Godhead; in the confession of the Faith, in the baptism of redemption,
in the working of miracles, in the indwelling of the saints, in the graces bestowed on obedience?
For there is not even one single gift which reaches creation without the Holy Ghost;1198
when not even a single word can be spoken in defence of Christ except by them that are
aided by the Spirit, as we have learnt in the Gospels from our Lord and Saviour.1199 And I

know not whether any one who has been partaker of the Holy Spirit will consent that we
should overlook all this, forget His fellowship in all things, and tear the Spirit asunder from
the Father and the Son. Where then are we to take Him and rank Him? With the creature?
Yet all the creature is in bondage, but the Spirit maketh free. “And where the Spirit of the
Lord is, there is liberty.”1200 Many arguments might be adduced to them that it is unseemly
to coordinate the Holy Spirit with created nature, but for the present I will pass them by.
Were I indeed to bring forward, in a manner befitting the dignity of the discussion, all the
proofs always available on our side, and so overthrow the objections of our opponents, a
lengthy dissertation would be required, and my readers might be worn out by my prolixity.
I therefore propose to reserve this matter for a special treatise,1201 and to apply myself to
the points now more immediately before us.</p>
<p>56. Let us then examine the points one by one. He is good by nature, in the same way
as the Father is good, and the Son is good; the creature on the other hand shares in goodness
by choosing the good. He knows “The deep things of God;”1202 the creature receives the
manifestation of ineffable things through the Spirit. He quickens together with God, who
produces and preserves all things alive,1203 and together with the Son, who gives life. “He
that raised up Christ from the dead,” it is said, “shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
the spirit that dwelleth in you;”1204 and again “my sheep hear my voice,<gap reason="omitted"/>and I give unto
them eternal life;”1205 but “the Spirit” also, it is said, “giveth life,”1206 and again “the Spirit,”
it is said, “is life, because of righteousness.”1207 And the Lord bears witness that “it is the
Spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing.”1208 How then shall we alienate the
Spirit from His quickening power, and make Him belong to lifeless nature? Who is so
contentious, who is so utterly without the heavenly gift,1209 and unfed by God’s good words,

who is so devoid of part and lot in eternal hopes, as to sever the Spirit from the Godhead
and rank Him with the creature?</p>
<p>57. Now it is urged that the Spirit is in us as a gift from God, and that the gift is not
reverenced with the same honour as that which is attributed to the giver. The Spirit is a gift
of God, but a gift of life, for the law of “the Spirit of life,” it is said, “hath made” us “free;”1210
and a gift of power, for “ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
you.”1211 Is He on this account to be lightly esteemed? Did not God also bestow His Son
as a free gift to mankind? “He that spared not His own Son,” it is said, “but delivered Him
up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?”1212 And in another
place, “that we might truly know the things that are freely given us of God,”1213 in reference
to the mystery of the Incarnation. It follows then that the maintainers of such arguments,
in making the greatness of God’s loving kindness an occasion of blasphemy, have really
surpassed the ingratitude of the Jews. They find fault with the Spirit because He gives us
freedom to call God our Father. “For God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into” our
“hearts crying Abba, Father,”1214 that the voice of the Spirit may become the very voice of
them that have received him.</p>

<p>That Scripture uses the words “in” or “by,” ἐν, cf. note on p. 3, in place of “with.” Wherein
also it is proved that the word “and” has the same force as “with.”</p>
<p>58. It is, however, asked by our opponents, how it is that Scripture nowhere describes
the Spirit as glorified together with the Father and the Son, but carefully avoids the use of
the expression “with the Spirit,” while it everywhere prefers to ascribe glory “in Him” as
being the fitter phrase. I should, for my own part, deny that the word in [or by] implies
lower dignity than the word “with;” I should maintain on the contrary that, rightly understood,
it leads us up to the highest possible meaning. This is the case where, as we have
observed, it often stands instead of with; as for instance, “I will go into thy house in burnt
offerings,”1215 instead of with burnt offerings and “he brought them forth also by silver and
gold,”1216 that is to say with silver and gold and “thou goest not forth in our armies”1217
instead of with our armies, and innumerable similar passages. In short I should very much
like to learn from this newfangled philosophy what kind of glory the Apostle ascribed by
the word in, according to the interpretation which our opponents proffer as derived from
Scripture, for I have nowhere found the formula “To Thee, O Father, be honour and glory,
through Thy only begotten Son, by [or in] the Holy Ghost,”—a form which to our opponents
comes, so to say, as naturally as the air they breathe. You may indeed find each of these
clauses separately,1218 but they will nowhere be able to show them to us arranged in this
conjunction. If, then, they want exact conformity to what is written, let them give us exact
references. If, on the other hand, they make concession to custom, they must not make us
an exception to such a privilege.</p>
<p>59. As we find both expressions in use among the faithful, we use both; in the belief
that full glory is equally given to the Spirit by both. The mouths, however, of revilers of the
truth may best be stopped by the preposition which, while it has the same meaning as that
of the Scriptures, is not so wieldy a weapon for our opponents, (indeed it is now an object
of their attack) and is used instead of the conjunction and. For to say “Paul and Silvanus
and Timothy”1219 is precisely the same thing as to say Paul with Timothy and Silvanus; for
the connexion of the names is preserved by either mode of expression. The Lord says “The
Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.”1220 If I say the Father and the Son with the Holy

Ghost shall I make, any difference in the sense? Of the connexion of names by means of
the conjunction and the instances are many. We read “The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost,”1221 and again “I beseech you
for the Lord Jesus Christ’s sake, and for the love of the Spirit.”1222 Now if we wish to use
with instead of and, what difference shall we have made? I do not see; unless any one according
to hard and fast grammatical rules might prefer the conjunction as copulative and
making the union stronger, and reject the preposition as of inferior force. But if we had to
defend ourselves on these points I do not suppose we should require a defence of many
words. As it is, their argument is not about syllables nor yet about this or that sound of a
word, but about things differing most widely in power and in truth. It is for this reason
that, while the use of the syllables is really a matter of no importance whatever, our opponents
are making the endeavour to authorise some syllables, and hunt out others from the Church.
For my own part, although the usefulness of the word is obvious as soon as it is heard, I will
nevertheless set forth the arguments which led our fathers to adopt the reasonable course
of employing the preposition “with.”1223 It does indeed equally well with the preposition
“and,” confute the mischief of Sabellius;1224 and it sets forth quite as well as “and” the distinction
of the hypostases, as in the words “I and my Father will come,”1225 and “I and my
Father are one.”1226 In addition to this the proof it contains of the eternal fellowship and
uninterrupted conjunction is excellent. For to say that the Son is with the Father is to exhibit

<note type="footnote">1223 “St. Basil’s statement of the reason of the use of μετά, σύν, in the Doxology, is not confirmed by any
earlier or contemporary writer, as far as the editor is aware, nor is it contradicted.” Rev. C.F.H. Johnston.</note>
<note type="footnote">1224 “Sabellius has been usually assigned to the middle of third century, Mr. Clinton giving a.d. 256–270 as
his active period. The discovery of the Philosophumena of Hippolytus has proved this to be a mistake, and
thrown his period back to the close of the second and beginning of the third century.…He was in full activity
in Rome during the Episcopate of Zephyrinus, a.d. 198–217.” Professor Stokes in D. C. Biog. iv. 569. For Basil’s
views of Sabellianism vide Epp. CCX., CCXIV., CCXXXV. In his Hær. Fab. Conf. ii. 9 Theodoret writes:
“Sabellius said that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost were one Hypostasis; one Person under three names; and he
describes the same now as Father, now as Son, now as Holy Ghost. He says that in the old Testament He gave
laws as Father, was incarnate in the new as Son, and visited the Apostles as Holy Ghost.” So in the ῎Εκθεσις τῆς
κατὰ μέρος πίστεως, a work falsely attributed to Gregory Thaumaturgus, and possibly due to Apollinaris, (cf.
Theod., Dial. iii.) “We shun Sabellius, who says that Father and Son are the same, calling Him who speaks
Father, and the Word, remaining in the Father and at the time of creation manifested, and, on the completion
of things returning to the Father, Son. He says the same of the Holy Ghost.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1225 Apparently an inexact reference to John xiv. 23.</note>

<pb n="222"/>
at once the distinction of the hypostases, and the inseparability of the fellowship. The same
thing is observable even in mere human matters, for the conjunction “and” intimates that
there is a common element in an action, while the preposition “with” declares in some sense
as well the communion in action. As, for instance;—Paul and Timothy sailed to Macedonia,
but both Tychicus and Onesimus were sent to the Colossians. Hence we learn that they did
the same thing. But suppose we are told that they sailed with, and were sent with? Then
we are informed in addition that they carried out the action in company with one another.
Thus while the word “with” upsets the error of Sabellius as no other word can, it routs also
sinners who err in the very opposite direction; those, I mean, who separate the Son from
the Father and the Spirit from the Son, by intervals of time.1227</p>
<p>60. As compared with “in,” there is this difference, that while “with” sets forth the mutual
conjunction of the parties associated,—as, for example, of those who sail with, or dwell
with, or do anything else in common, “in” shews their relation to that matter in which they
happen to be acting. For we no sooner hear the words “sail in” or “dwell in” than we form
the idea of the boat or the house. Such is the distinction between these words in ordinary
usage; and laborious investigation might discover further illustrations. I have no time to
examine into the nature of the syllables. Since then it has been shewn that “with” most
clearly gives the sense of conjunction, let it be declared, if you will, to be under safe-conduct,
and cease to wage your savage and truceless war against it. Nevertheless, though the word
is naturally thus auspicious, yet if any one likes, in the ascription of praise, to couple the
names by the syllable “and,” and to give glory, as we have taught in the Gospel, in the formula
of baptism, Father and Son and Holy Ghost,1228 be it so: no one will make any objection.
On these conditions, if you will, let us come to terms. But our foes would rather surrender
their tongues than accept this word. It is this that rouses against us their implacable and
truceless war. We must offer the ascription of glory to God, it is contended, in the Holy
Ghost, and not and to the Holy Ghost, and they passionately cling to this word in, as though
it lowered the Spirit. It will therefore be not unprofitable to speak at greater length about
it; and I shall be astonished if they do not, when they have heard what we have to urge, reject
the in as itself a traitor to their cause, and a deserter to the side of the glory of the Spirit.</p>

<p>That the word “in,” in as many senses as it bears, is understood of the Spirit.</p>
<p>61. Now, short and simple as this utterance is, it appears to me, as I consider it, that its
meanings are many and various. For of the senses in which “in” is used, we find that all
help our conceptions of the Spirit. Form is said to be in Matter; Power to be in what is capable
of it; Habit to be in him who is affected by it; and so on.1229 Therefore, inasmuch as the
Holy Spirit perfects rational beings, completing their excellence, He is analogous to Form.
For he, who no longer “lives after the flesh,”1230 but, being “led by the Spirit of God,”1231
is called a Son of God, being “conformed to the image of the Son of God,”1232 is described
as spiritual. And as is the power of seeing in the healthy eye, so is the operation of the
Spirit in the purified soul. Wherefore also Paul prays for the Ephesians that they may have
their “eyes enlightened” by “the Spirit of wisdom.”1233 And as the art in him who has acquired
it, so is the grace of the Spirit in the recipient ever present, though not continuously
in operation. For as the art is potentially in the artist, but only in operation when he is
working in accordance with it, so also the Spirit is ever present with those that are worthy,
but works, as need requires, in prophecies, or in healings, or in some other actual carrying
into effect of His potential action.1234 Furthermore as in our bodies is health, or heat, or,
generally, their variable conditions, so, very frequently is the Spirit in the soul; since He
does not abide with those who, on account of the instability of their will, easily reject the
grace which they have received. An instance of this is seen in Saul,1235 and the seventy
elders of the children of Israel, except Eldad and Medad, with whom alone the Spirit appears

It is of course quite true that δύναμις is one of the four words used in the New Testament for miracle, and often
has that sense, but here the context suggest the antithesis between potential and actual operation, and moreover
non-miraculous (in the ordinary sense) operations of the Spirit need not be excluded; in a deep sense all His
operations are miraculous. ἐνέργημα is an uncommon word, meaning the work wrought by ἐνέργεια or operation.</note>

to have remained,1236 and, generally, any one similar to these in character. And like reason
in the soul, which is at one time the thought in the heart, and at another speech uttered by
the tongue,1237 so is the Holy Spirit, as when He “beareth witness with our spirit,”1238 and
when He “cries in our hearts, Abba, Father,”1239 or when He speaks on our behalf, as it is
said, “It is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of our Father which speaketh in you.”1240 Again,
the Spirit is conceived of, in relation to the distribution of gifts, as a whole in parts. For we
all are “members one of another, having gifts differing according to the grace that is given
us.”1241 Wherefore “the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee; nor again the
head to the feet, I have no need of you,”1242 but all together complete the Body of Christ in
the Unity of the Spirit, and render to one another the needful aid that comes of the gifts.
“But God hath set the members in the body, every one of them, as it hath pleased Him.”1243
But “the members have the same care for one another,”1244 according to the inborn spiritual
communion of their sympathy. Wherefore, “whether one member suffer, all the members
suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.”1245 And as
parts in the whole so are we individually in the Spirit, because we all “were baptized in one
body into one spirit.”1246</p>
<p>62. It is an extraordinary statement, but it is none the less true, that the Spirit is frequently
spoken of as the place of them that are being sanctified, and it will become evident
that even by this figure the Spirit, so far from being degraded, is rather glorified. For words
applicable to the body are, for the sake of clearness, frequently transferred in scripture to
spiritual conceptions. Accordingly we find the Psalmist, even in reference to God, saying
“Be Thou to me a champion God and a strong place to save me”1247 and concerning the
Spirit “behold there is place by me, and stand upon a rock.”1248 Plainly meaning the place

or contemplation in the Spirit wherein, after Moses had entered thither, he was able to see
God intelligibly manifested to him. This is the special and peculiar place of true worship;
for it is said “Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place…but
in the place the Lord thy God shall choose.”1249 Now what is a spiritual burnt offering?
“The sacrifice of praise.”1250 And in what place do we offer it? In the Holy Spirit. Where
have we learnt this? From the Lord himself in the words “The true worshippers shall worship
the Father in spirit and in truth.”1251 This place Jacob saw and said “The Lord is in this
place.”1252 It follows that the Spirit is verily the place of the saints and the saint is the
proper place for the Spirit, offering himself as he does for the indwelling of God, and called
God’s Temple.1253 So Paul speaks in Christ, saying “In the sight of God we speak in
Christ,”1254 and Christ in Paul, as he himself says “Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking
in me.”1255 So also in the Spirit he speaketh mysteries,1256 and again the Spirit speaks in
him.1257</p>

<p>63. In relation to the originate,1258 then, the Spirit is said to be in them “in divers portions
and in divers manners,”1259 while in relation to the Father and the Son it is more
consistent with true religion to assert Him not to be in but to be with. For the grace flowing
from Him when He dwells in those that are worthy, and carries out His own operations, is
well described as existing in those that are able to receive Him. On the other hand His essential
existence before the ages, and His ceaseless abiding with Son and Father, cannot be
contemplated without requiring titles expressive of eternal conjunction. For absolute and
real co-existence is predicated in the case of things which are mutually inseparable. We say,
for instance, that heat exists in the hot iron, but in the case of the actual fire it co-exists; and,
similarly, that health exists in the body, but that life co-exists with the soul. It follows that
wherever the fellowship is intimate, congenital,1260 and inseparable, the word with is more
expressive, suggesting, as it does, the idea of inseparable fellowship. Where on the other
hand the grace flowing from the Spirit naturally comes and goes, it is properly and truly
<note type="footnote">1258 ἐν τοῦς γενητοῖς, as in the Bodleian ms. The Benedictine text adopts the common reading γεννητοις,
with the note, “Sed discrimen illud parvi momenti.” If St. Basil wrote γεννητοῖς, he used it in the looser sense
of mortal: in its strict sense of “begotten” it would be singularly out of place here, as the antithesis of the reference
to the Son, who is γεννητός, would be spoilt. In the terminology of theology, so far from being “parvi momenti,”
the distinction is vital. In the earlier Greek philosophy ἀγένητος and ἀγέννητος are both used as nearly synonymous
to express unoriginate eternal. cf. Plat., Phæd. 245 D., ἀρχὴ δὲ ἀγένητόν, with Plat., Tim. 52 A., Τουτων
δὲ οὕτως ἐχόντων ὁμολογητέον ἓν μὲν εἶναι τὸ κατὰ ταὐτὰ εἶδος ἔχον ἀγέννητον καὶ ἀνώλεθρον. And the
earliest patristic use similarly meant by γεννητός and ἀγέννητος created and uncreated, as in Ign., Ad Eph. vii.,
where our Lord is called γεννητὸς καὶ ἀγέννητος, ἐν ἀνθρ ?πω Θεὸς, ἐν θανάτῳ ζωὴ ἀληθινή. cf. Bp. Lightfoot’s
note. But “such language is not in accordance with later theological definitions, which carefully distinguished
between γενητός and γεννητός, between ἀγένητος and ἀγέννητος; so that γενητός, ἀγένητος, respectively
denied and affirmed the eternal existence, being equivalent to κτιστός, ἄκτιστος, while γεννητός, ἀγέννητος
described certain ontological relations, whether in time or in eternity. In the later theological language, therefore,
the Son was γεννητός even in His Godhead. See esp. Joann. Damasc., De Fid. Orth. i. 8 (I. p. 135, Lequin), χρὴ
γὰρ εἰδέναι ὅτι τὸ ἀγένητον, διὰ τοῦ ἑνὸς ν γραφόμενον, τὸ ἄκτιστον ἢ τὸ μὴ γενόμενον σημαίνει, τὸ δὲ
ἀγέννητον, διὰ τῶν δύο νν γραφόμενον, δηλοῖ τὸ μὴ γεννηθέν; whence he draws the conclusion that μόνος ὁ
πατὴρ ἀγέννητος and μόνος ὁ υἱU+0026 232·ς γεννητός.” Bp. Lightfoot, Ap. Fathers, Pt. II. Vol. II. p. 90, where the
history of the worlds is exhaustively discussed. At the time of the Arian controversy the Catholic disputants
were chary of employing these terms, because of the base uses to which their opponents put them; so St. Basil,
Contra Eunom. iv. protests against the Arian argument εἰ ἀγέννητος ὁ πατὴρ γεννητὸς δὲ ὁ υἱU+0026 232·ς, οὐ τῆς
αὐτῆς οὐσιας. cf. Ath., De Syn. in this series, p. 475, and De Decretis, on Newman’s confusion of the terms, p.

said to exist in, even if on account of the firmness of the recipients’ disposition to good the
grace abides with them continually. Thus whenever we have in mind the Spirit’s proper
rank, we contemplate Him as being with the Father and the Son, but when we think of the
grace that flows from Him operating on those who participate in it, we say that the Spirit is
in us. And the doxology which we offer “in the Spirit” is not an acknowledgment of His
rank; it is rather a confession of our own weakness, while we shew that we are not sufficient
to glorify Him of ourselves, but our sufficiency1261 is in the Holy Spirit. Enabled in, [or by,]
Him we render thanks to our God for the benefits we have received, according to the
measure of our purification from evil, as we receive one a larger and another a smaller share
of the aid of the Spirit, that we may offer “the sacrifice of praise to God.”1262 According to
one use, then, it is thus that we offer our thanksgiving, as the true religion requires, in the
Spirit; although it is not quite unobjectionable that any one should testify of himself “the
Spirit of God is in me, and I offer glory after being made wise through the grace that flows
from Him.” For to a Paul it is becoming to say “I think also that I have the Spirit of God,”1263
and again, “that good thing which was committed to thee keep by the Holy Ghost which
dwelleth in us.”1264 And of Daniel it is fitting to say that “the Holy Spirit of God is in
him,”1265 and similarly of men who are like these in virtue.</p>
<p>64. Another sense may however be given to the phrase, that just as the Father is seen
in the Son, so is the Son in the Spirit. The “worship in the Spirit” suggests the idea of the
operation of our intelligence being carried on in the light, as may be learned from the words
spoken to the woman of Samaria. Deceived as she was by the customs of her country into
the belief that worship was local, our Lord, with the object of giving her better instruction,
said that worship ought to be offered “in Spirit and in Truth,”1266 plainly meaning by the
Truth, Himself. As then we speak of the worship offered in the Image of God the Father as
worship in the Son, so too do we speak of worship in the Spirit as shewing in Himself the
Godhead of the Lord. Wherefore even in our worship the Holy Spirit is inseparable from
the Father and the Son. If you remain outside the Spirit you will not be able even to worship
at all; and on your becoming in Him you will in no wise be able to dissever Him from
God;—any more than you will divorce light from visible objects. For it is impossible to behold
the Image of the invisible God except by the enlightenment of the Spirit, and impracticable
for him to fix his gaze on the Image to dissever the light from the Image, because the cause

Image and Seal, graven to the like.1267</p>

for every thought concerning Him. Why then, they ask, have we introduced this new phrase,
saying, “with the Spirit” instead of “in the Holy Spirit,” thus employing an expression which
is quite unnecessary, and sanctioned by no usage in the churches? Now it has been asserted
in the previous portion of this treatise that the word “in” has not been specially allotted to
the Holy Spirit, but is common to the Father and the Son. It has also been, in my opinion,
sufficiently demonstrated that, so far from detracting anything from the dignity of the
Spirit, it leads all, but those whose thoughts are wholly perverted, to the sublimest height.
It remains for me to trace the origin of the word “with;” to explain what force it has, and to

<p>66.1268 Of the beliefs and practices whether generally accepted or publicly enjoined
which are preserved in the Church1269 some we possess derived from written teaching;
<note type="footnote">1268 The genuineness of this latter portion of the Treatise was objected to by Erasmus on the ground that
the style is unlike that of Basil’s soberer writings. Bp. Jeremy Taylor follows Erasmus (Vol. vi. ed. 1852, p. 427).
It was vindicated by Casaubon, who recalls St. John Damascene’s quotation of the Thirty Chapters to Amphilochius.
Mr. C.F.H. Johnston remarks, “The later discovery of the Syriac Paraphrases of the whole book pushes back
this argument to about one hundred years from the date of St. Basil’s writing. The peculiar care taken by St.
Basil for the writing out of the treatise, and for its safe arrival in Amphilochius’ hands, and the value set upon
it by the friends of both, make the forgery of half the present book, and the substitution of it for the original
within that period, almost incredible.” Section 66 is quoted as an authoritative statement on the right use of
Tradition “as a guide to the right understanding of Holy Scripture, for the right ministration of the Sacraments,
and the preservation of sacred rights and ceremonies in the purity of their original institution,” in Philaret’s
Longer Catechism of the Eastern Church. St. Basil is, however, strong on the supremacy of Holy Scripture, as in
the passages quoted in Bp. H. Browne, On the xxxix Articles: “Believe those things which are written; the things
which are not written seek not.” (Hom. xxix. adv. Calum. S. Trin.) “It is a manifest defection from the faith,
and a proof of arrogance, either to reject anything of what is written, or to introduce anything that is not.” (De
Fide. i.) cf. also Letters CV. and CLIX. On the right use of Tradition cf. Hooker, Ecc. Pol. lxv. 2, “Lest, therefore,
the name of tradition should be offensive to any, considering how far by some it hath been and is abused, we
mean by traditions ordinances made in the prime of Christian Religion, established with that authority which
Christ hath left to His Church for matters indifferent, and in that consideration requisite to be observed, till like
authority see just and reasonable causes to alter them. So that traditions ecclesiastical are not rudely and in
gross to be shaken off, because the inventors of them were men.” cf. Tert., De Præsc. 36, 20, 21, “Constat omnem
doctrinam quæ cum illis ecclesiis apostolicis matricibus et originalibus fidei conspiret veritati deputandam, id sine
dubio tenentem quod ecclesiæ ab apostolis, apostoli a Christo, Christus a Deo accepit.” VideThomasius, Christ.

<note type="footnote">1269 “τῶς ἐν τῇ ΕκκλησίU+0026 139· πεφυλαγμένων δογμάτων καὶ κηρυγμάτων.” To give the apparent meaning
of the original seems impossible except by some such paraphrase as the above. In Scripture δόγμα, which occurs
five times (Luke ii. 1, Acts xvi. 4, xvii. 7, Eph. ii. 15, and Col. ii. 14), always has its proper sense of decree or ordinances.
cf. Bp. Lightfoot, on Col. ii. 14, and his contention that the Greek Fathers generally have mistaken
the force of the passage in understanding δόγματα in both Col. and Eph. to mean the doctrines and precepts of
the Gospel. Κήρυγμα occurs eight times (Matt. xii. 41, Luke xi. 32, Rom. xvi. 25, 1 Cor. i. 21, ii. 4, xv. 14, 2 Tim
iv. 17, and Tit. i. 3), always in the sense of preaching or proclamation. “The later Christian sense of δόγμα,
meaning doctrine, came from its secondary classical use, where it was applied to the authoritative and categorical
‘sentences’ of the philosophers: cf. Just. Mart., Apol. i. 7. οἰ ἐν ῞Ελλησι τὰ αὐτοῖς ἀρεστὰ δογματίσαντες ἐκ
παντὸς τῷ ενὶ ὀνόματι φιλοσοφίας προσαγορεύοντα, καίπερ τῶν δογμάτων ἐναντίων ὄντων.” [All the sects

others we have received delivered to us “in a mystery”1270 by the tradition of the apostles;
and both of these in relation to true religion have the same force. And these no one will
gainsay;—no one, at all events, who is even moderately versed in the institutions of the
Church. For were we to attempt to reject such customs as have no written authority, on the
ground that the importance they possess is small, we should unintentionally injure the
<note type="footnote">Cic., Acad. ii. 19. ‘De suis decretis quæ philosophi vocant δόγματα.’…There is an approach towards the ecclesiastical
meaning in Ignat., Mag. 13, βεβαιωθῆσαι ἐν τοῖς δόγμασι τοῦ κυρίου καὶ τῶν ἀποστόλων.” Bp. Lightfoot
in Col. ii. 14. The “doctrines” of heretics are also called δόγματα, as in Basil, Ep. CCLXI. and Socr., E. H. iii. 10.
cf. Bp. Bull, in Serm. 2, “The dogmata or tenets of the Sadducees.” In Orig., c. Cels. iii. p. 135, Ed. Spencer, 1658,
δόγμα is used of the gospel or teaching of our Lord. The special point about St. Basil’s use of δόγματα is that he
uses the word of doctrines and practices privately and tacitly sanctioned in the Church (like ἀπόρρητα, which
is used of the esoteric doctrine of the Pythagoreans, Plat., Phæd. 62. B.), while he reserves κηρύγματα for what
is now often understood by δόγματα, i.e. “legitima synodo decreta.” cf. Ep. LII., where he speaks of the great
κήρυγμα of the Fathers at Nicæa. In this he is supported by Eulogius, Patriarch of Alexandria, 579–607, of
whom Photius (Cod. ccxxx. Migne Pat. Gr. ciii. p. 1027) writes, “In this work,” i.e. Or. II. “he says that of the
doctrines (διδαγμάτων) handed down in the church by the ministers of the word, some are δόγματα, and others
κηρύγματα. The distinction is that δόγματα are announced with concealment and prudence, and are often designedly
compassed with obscurity, in order that holy things may not be exposed to profane persons nor pearls
cast before swine. Κηρύγματα, on the other hand, are announced without any concealment.” So the Benedictine
Editors speak of Origen (c. Cels. i. 7) as replying to Celsus, “prædicationem Christianorum toti orbi notiorem
esse quam placita philosophorum: sed tamen fatetur, ut apud philosophos, ita etiam apud Christianos nonulla
esse veluti interiora, quæ post exteriorem et propositam omnibus doctrinam tradantur.” Of κηρύματα they note,
“Videntur hoc nomine designari leges ecclesiasticæ et canonum decreta quæ promulgari in ecclesia mos erat, ut
neminem laterent.” Mr. C.F.H. Johnston remarks: “The ὁμοούσιον, which many now-a-days would call the
Nicene dogma (τὰ τοῦ ὁμοουσίου δόγματα, Soc., E.H. iii. 10) because it was put forth in the Council of Nicæa,
was for that reason called not δόγμα, but κήρυγμα, by St. Basil, who would have said that it became the κήρυγμα
(definition) of that Council, because it had always been the δόγμα of the Church.” In extra theological philosophy
a dogma has all along meant a certainly expressed opinion whether formally decreed or not. So Shaftesbury,
Misc. Ref. ii. 2, “He who is certain, or presumes to say he knows, is in that particular whether he be mistaken or
in the right a dogmatist.” cf. Littré S.V. for a similar use in French. In theology the modern Roman limitation
of dogma to decreed doctrine is illustrated by the statement of Abbé Bérgier (Dict. de Théol. Ed. 1844) of the
Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin. “Or, nous convenons que ce n’est pas un dogme de foi,” because,
though a common opinion among Romanists, it had not been so asserted at the Council of Trent. Since the
publication of Pius IX’s Edict of 1854 it has become, to ultramontanists, a “dogma of faith.”</note>

nothing more.1271 For instance, to take the first and most general example, who is thence

we add other words as being of great importance to the validity of the ministry, and these
we derive from unwritten teaching. Moreover we bless the water of baptism and the oil of
the chrism, and besides this the catechumen who is being baptized. On what written authority
do we do this? Is not our authority silent and mystical tradition? Nay, by what written

<note type="footnote">1272 ἐπὶ τῇ ἀναδείξει. The Benedictine note is: “Non respicit Basilius ad ritum ostensionis Eucharistiæ, ut
multi existimarunt, sed potius ad verba Liturgiæ ipsi ascriptæ, cum petit sacerdos, ut veniat Spiritus sanctus
ἁγιάσαι και ἀναδεῖξαι τὸν μὲν ἄρτον τοῦτον αὐτὸ τὸ τίμιον σῶμα τοῦ κυρίου. Haec autem verba ἐπὶ τῇ
ἀναδειξει, sic reddit Erasmus,cum ostenditur. Vituperat eum Ducæus; sicque ipse vertit, cum conficitur, atque
hanc interpretationem multis exemplis confirmat. Videtur tamen nihil prorsus vitii habitura haec interpretatio,
Invocationis verba cum ostenditur panis Eucharistiæ, id est, cum panis non jam panis est, sed panis Eucharistiæ,
sive corpus Christi ostenditur; et in liturgia, ut sanctificet et ostendat hunc quidem panem, ipsum pretiosum
corpus Domini. Nam 10 Cur eam vocem reformidemus, qua Latini uti non dubitant, ubi de Eucharistia loquuntur?
Quale est illud Cypriani in epistola 63 ad Cæcilium: Vino Christi sanguis ostenditur. Sic etiam Tertullianus I.​ Marc. c. 14: Panem quo ipsum corpus suum repræsentat 20 Ut Græce, ἀναδεῖξαι, ἀποφαίνειν, ita etiam Latine,
ostendere, corpus Christi præsens in Eucharistia significatione quodam modo exprimit. Hoc enim verbum non
solum panem fieri corpus Domini significat, sed etiam fidem nostram excitat, ut illud corpus sub specie panis
videndum, tegendum, adorandum ostendi credamus. Quemadmodum Irenæus, cum ait lib. iv. cap. 33: Accipiens
panem suum corpus esse confitebatur, et temperamentum calicis suum sanguinem conformavit, non solum
mutationem panis et vini in corpus et sanguinem Christi exprimit, sed ipsam etiam Christi asseverationem, quæ
hanc nobis mutationem persuadet: sic qui corpus Christi in Eucharistia ostendi et repræsentari dicunt, non modo
jejuno et exiliter loqui non videntur, sed etiam acriores Christi præsentis adorandi stimulos subjicere. Poterat
ergo retineri interpretatio Erasmi; sed quia viris eruditis displicuit, satius visum est quid sentirem in hac nota exponere.”
This view of the meaning of ἀναδείκνυσθαι and ἀνάδειξις as being equivalent to ποιεῖν and ποίησις
is borne out and illustrated by Suicer, S.V. “Ex his jam satis liquere arbitror ἀναδειξαι apud Basilium id esse
quod alii Græci patres dicunt ποιεῖν vel ἀποφαίνειν σῶμα χριστοῦ.” It is somewhat curious to find Bellarmine
(De Sacr. Euch. iv. § 14) interpreting the prayer to God εὐλογῆσαι καὶ ἁγιάσαι καὶ ἀναδεῖξαι to mean “ostende
per effectum salutarem in mentibus nostris istum panem salutificatum non esse panem vulgarem sed coelestem.”</note>

hardly likely to be publicly paraded about in written documents. What was the meaning of
the mighty Moses in not making all the parts of the tabernacle open to every one? The
profane he stationed without the sacred barriers; the first courts he conceded to the purer;
the Levites alone he judged worthy of being servants of the Deity; sacrifices and burnt offerings
and the rest of the priestly functions he allotted to the priests; one chosen out of all he
admitted to the shrine, and even this one not always but on only one day in the year, and
of this one day a time was fixed for his entry so that he might gaze on the Holy of Holies
amazed at the strangeness and novelty of the sight. Moses was wise enough to know that
contempt stretches to the trite and to the obvious, while a keen interest is naturally associated
with the unusual and the unfamiliar. In the same manner the Apostles and Fathers who
laid down laws for the Church from the beginning thus guarded the awful dignity of the
mysteries in secrecy and silence, for what is bruited abroad random among the common
folk is no mystery at all. This is the reason for our tradition of unwritten precepts and
practices, that the knowledge of our dogmas may not become neglected and contemned by
the multitude through familiarity. “Dogma” and “Kerugma” are two distinct things; the
former is observed in silence; the latter is proclaimed to all the world. One form of this silence
is the obscurity employed in Scripture, which makes the meaning of “dogmas” difficult to
be understood for the very advantage of the reader: Thus we all look to the East1275 at our
prayers, but few of us know that we are seeking our own old country,1276 Paradise, which
God planted in Eden in the East.1277 We pray standing,1278 on the first day of the week,
but we do not all know the reason. On the day of the resurrection (or “standing again” Grk.

ἀνάστασις) we remind ourselves of the grace given to us by standing at prayer, not only
because we rose with Christ,1279 and are bound to “seek those things which are above,”1280
but because the day seems to us to be in some sense an image of the age which we expect,
wherefore, though it is the beginning of days, it is not called by Moses first, but one.1281
For he says “There was evening, and there was morning, one day,” as though the same day
often recurred. Now “one” and “eighth” are the same, in itself distinctly indicating that
really “one” and “eighth” of which the Psalmist makes mention in certain titles of the Psalms,
the state which follows after this present time, the day which knows no waning or eventide,
and no successor, that age which endeth not or groweth old.1282 Of necessity, then, the
church teaches her own foster children to offer their prayers on that day standing, to the
end that through continual reminder of the endless life we may not neglect to make provision
for our removal thither. Moreover all Pentecost is a reminder of the resurrection expected
in the age to come. For that one and first day, if seven times multiplied by seven, completes
the seven weeks of the holy Pentecost; for, beginning at the first, Pentecost ends with the
same, making fifty revolutions through the like intervening days. And so it is a likeness of
eternity, beginning as it does and ending, as in a circling course, at the same point. On this
day the rules of the church have educated us to prefer the upright attitude of prayer, for by
their plain reminder they, as it were, make our mind to dwell no longer in the present but
in the future. Moreover every time we fall upon our knees and rise from off them we shew
by the very deed that by our sin we fell down to earth, and by the loving kindness of our
Creator were called back to heaven.</p>
<p>67. Time will fail me if I attempt to recount the unwritten mysteries of the Church. Of
the rest I say nothing; but of the very confession of our faith in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
what is the written source? If it be granted that, as we are baptized, so also under the obligation
to believe, we make our confession in like terms as our baptism, in accordance with
the tradition of our baptism and in conformity with the principles of true religion, let our
opponents grant us too the right to be as consistent in our ascription of glory as in our
confession of faith. If they deprecate our doxology on the ground that it lacks written authority,
let them give us the written evidence for the confession of our faith and the other
matters which we have enumerated. While the unwritten traditions are so many, and their
bearing on “the mystery of godliness”1283 is so important, can they refuse to allow us a single

word which has come down to us from the Fathers;—which we found, derived from untutored
custom, abiding in unperverted churches;—a word for which the arguments are
strong, and which contributes in no small degree to the completeness of the force of the
mystery?</p>
<p>68. The force of both expressions has now been explained. I will proceed to state once
more wherein they agree and wherein they differ from one another;—not that they are opposed
in mutual antagonism, but that each contributes its own meaning to true religion.
The preposition “in” states the truth rather relatively to ourselves; while “with” proclaims
the fellowship of the Spirit with God. Wherefore we use both words, by the one expressing
the dignity of the Spirit; by the other announcing the grace that is with us. Thus we ascribe
glory to God both “in” the Spirit, and “with” the Spirit; and herein it is not our word that
we use, but we follow the teaching of the Lord as we might a fixed rule, and transfer His
word to things connected and closely related, and of which the conjunction in the mysteries
is necessary. We have deemed ourselves under a necessary obligation to combine in our
confession of the faith Him who is numbered with Them at Baptism, and we have treated
the confession of the faith as the origin and parent of the doxology. What, then, is to be
done? They must now instruct us either not to baptize as we have received, or not to believe
as we were baptized, or not to ascribe glory as we have believed. Let any man prove if he
can that the relation of sequence in these acts is not necessary and unbroken; or let any man
deny if he can that innovation here must mean ruin everywhere. Yet they never stop dinning
in our ears that the ascription of glory “with” the Holy Spirit is unauthorized and unscriptural
and the like. We have stated that so far as the sense goes it is the same to say “glory
be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost,” and “glory be to the Father and to
the Son with the Holy Ghost.” It is impossible for any one to reject or cancel the syllable
“and,” which is derived from the very words of our Lord, and there is nothing to hinder the
acceptance of its equivalent. What amount of difference and similarity there is between the
two we have already shewn. And our argument is confirmed by the fact that the Apostle
uses either word indifferently,—saying at one time “in the name of the Lord Jesus and by
the Spirit of our God;”1284 at another “when ye are gathered together, and my Spirit, with
the power of our Lord Jesus,”1285 with no idea that it makes any difference to the connexion
of the names whether he use the conjunction or the preposition.</p>

<p>That our opponents refuse to concede in the case of the Spirit the terms which Scripture uses
in the case of men, as reigning together with Christ.</p>
<p>69. But let us see if we can bethink us of any defence of this usage of our fathers; for
they who first originated the expression are more open to blame than we ourselves. Paul
in his Letter to the Colossians says, “And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision<gap reason="omitted"/>
hath He quickened together with”1286 Christ. Did then God give to a whole people
and to the Church the boon of the life with Christ, and yet the life with Christ does not belong
to the Holy Spirit? But if this is impious even to think of, is it not rightly reverent so to
make our confession, as They are by nature in close conjunction? Furthermore what
boundless lack of sensibility does it not shew in these men to confess that the Saints are with
Christ, (if, as we know is the case, Paul, on becoming absent from the body, is present with
the Lord,1287 and, after departing, is with Christ1288) and, so far as lies in their power, to
refuse to allow to the Spirit to be with Christ even to the same extent as men? And Paul
calls himself a “labourer together with God”1289 in the dispensation of the Gospel; will they
bring an indictment for impiety against us, if we apply the term “fellow-labourer” to the
Holy Spirit, through whom in every creature under heaven the Gospel bringeth forth
fruit?1290 The life of them that have trusted in the Lord “is hidden,” it would seem, “with
Christ in God, and when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall” they themselves
also “appear with Him in glory;”1291 and is the Spirit of life Himself, “Who made us free
from the law of sin,”1292 not with Christ, both in the secret and hidden life with Him, and
in the manifestation of the glory which we expect to be manifested in the saints? We are
“heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ,”1293 and is the Spirit without part or lot in the
fellowship of God and of His Christ? “The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that
we are the children of God;”1294 and are we not to allow to the Spirit even that testimony
of His fellowship with God which we have learnt from the Lord? For the height of folly is

reached if we through the faith in Christ which is in the Spirit1295 hope that we shall be
raised together with Him and sit together in heavenly places,1296 whenever He shall change
our vile body from the natural to the spiritual,1297 and yet refuse to assign to the Spirit any
share in the sitting together, or in the glory, or anything else which we have received from
Him. Of all the boons of which, in accordance with the indefeasible grant of Him who has
promised them, we have believed ourselves worthy, are we to allow none to the Holy Spirit,
as though they were all above His dignity? It is yours according to your merit to be “ever
with the Lord,” and you expect to be caught up “in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
and to be ever with the Lord.”1298 You declare the man who numbers and ranks the Spirit
with the Father and the Son to be guilty of intolerable impiety. Can you really now deny
that the Spirit is with Christ?</p>
<p>70. I am ashamed to add the rest. You expect to be glorified together with Christ; (“if
so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together;”1299) but you do not
glorify the “Spirit of holiness”1300 together with Christ, as though He were not worthy to
receive equal honour even with you. You hope to “reign with”1301 Christ; but you “do
despite unto the Spirit of grace”1302 by assigning Him the rank of a slave and a subordinate.
And I say this not to demonstrate that so much is due to the Spirit in the ascription of glory,
but to prove the unfairness of those who will not ever give so much as this, and shrink from
the fellowship of the Spirit with Son and Father as from impiety. Who could touch on these
things without a sigh?1303 Is it not so plain as to be within the perception even of a child
that this present state of things preludes the threatened eclipse of the faith? The undeniable
has become the uncertain. We profess belief in the Spirit, and then we quarrel with our
own confessions. We are baptized, and begin to fight again. We call upon Him as the Prince
of Life, and then despise Him as a slave like ourselves. We received Him with the Father
and the Son, and we dishonour Him as a part of creation. Those who “know not what they
ought to pray for,”1304 even though they be induced to utter a word of the Spirit with awe,
as though coming near His dignity, yet prune down all that exceeds the exact proportion

in words our gratitude for the benefits which we are actually receiving; for He “passes
all understanding,”1305 and convicts speech of its natural inability even to approach His

<p>Enumeration of the illustrious men in the Church who in their writings have used the word
“with.”</p>
<p>71. In answer to the objection that the doxology in the form “with the Spirit” has no
written authority, we maintain that if there is no other instance of that which is unwritten,
then this must not be received. But if the greater number of our mysteries are admitted into
our constitution without written authority, then, in company with the many others, let us
receive this one. For I hold it apostolic to abide also by the unwritten traditions. “I praise
you,” it is said, “that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances as I delivered
them to you;”1308 and “Hold fast the traditions which ye have been taught whether by word,
or our Epistle.”1309 One of these traditions is the practice which is now before us, which
they who ordained from the beginning, rooted firmly in the churches, delivering it to their
successors, and its use through long custom advances pace by pace with time. If, as in a
Court of Law, we were at a loss for documentary evidence, but were able to bring before
you a large number of witnesses, would you not give your vote for our acquittal? I think
so; for “at the mouth of two or three witnesses shall the matter be established.”1310 And if
we could prove clearly to you that a long period of time was in our favour, should we not
have seemed to you to urge with reason that this suit ought not to be brought into court
against us? For ancient dogmas inspire a certain sense of awe, venerable as they are with a
hoary antiquity. I will therefore give you a list of the supporters of the word (and the time
too must be taken into account in relation to what passes unquestioned). For it did not
originate with us. How could it? We, in comparison with the time during which this word
has been in vogue, are, to use the words of Job, “but of yesterday.”1311 I myself, if I must
speak of what concerns me individually, cherish this phrase as a legacy left me by my fathers.
It was delivered to me by one1312 who spent a long life in the service of God, and by him I
was both baptized, and admitted to the ministry of the church. While examining, so far as
I could, if any of the blessed men of old used the words to which objection is now made, I
found many worthy of credit both on account of their early date, and also a characteristic
in which they are unlike the men of to-day—because of the exactness of their knowledge.

Of these some coupled the word in the doxology by the preposition, others by the conjunction,
but were in no case supposed to be acting divergently,—at least so far as the right sense
of true religion is concerned.</p>
<p>72. There is the famous Irenæus,1313 and Clement of Rome;1314 Dionysius of Rome,1315
and, strange to say, Dionysius of Alexandria, in his second Letter to his namesake, on
“Conviction and Defence,” so concludes. I will give you his very words. “Following all
these, we, too, since we have received from the presbyters who were before us a form and
rule, offering thanksgiving in the same terms with them, thus conclude our Letter to you.
To God the Father and the Son our Lord Jesus Christ, with the Holy Ghost, glory and might
for ever and ever; amen.” And no one can say that this passage has been altered. He would
not have so persistently stated that he had received a form and rule if he had said “in the
Spirit.” For of this phrase the use is abundant: it was the use of “with” which required defence.
Dionysius moreover in the middle of his treatise thus writes in opposition to the
Sabellians, “If by the hypostases being three they say that they are divided, there are three,
though they like it not. Else let them destroy the divine Trinity altogether.” And again:
“most divine on this account after the Unity is the Trinity.”1316 Clement, in more primitive
fashion, writes, “God lives, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.”1317 And now
let us hear how Irenæus, who lived near the times of the Apostles, mentions the Spirit in
his work “Against the Heresies.”1318 “The Apostle rightly calls carnal them that are unbridled
and carried away to their own desires, having no desire for the Holy Spirit,”1319 and in another
passage Irenæus says, “The Apostle exclaimed that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
kingdom of the heavens lest we, being without share in the divine Spirit, fall short of the

of Dionysius’ heretical tendencies expressed in Letter ix. q.v. Athanasius, however, (De Sent. Dionysii) was satisfied
as to the orthodoxy of his predecessor. Bp. Westcott (Dict. C. Biog. i. 851) quotes Lumper (Hist. Pat. xii.
86) as supposing that Basil’s charge against Dionysius of sowing the seeds of the Anomoean heresy was due to
imperfect acquaintance with his writings. In Letter clxxxviii. Basil calls him “the Great,” which implies general
approval.</note>

same chapter, Irenæus says of himself that he τὴν πρωτὴν τῶν ᾽Αποστολῶν κατειληφέναι την διαδοχήν “had

kingdom of the heavens.” If any one thinks Eusebius of Palestine1320 worthy of credit on
account of his wide experience, I point further to the very words he uses in discussing
questions concerning the polygamy of the ancients. Stirring up himself to his work, he
writes “invoking the holy God of the Prophets, the Author of light, through our Saviour Jesus
Christ, with the Holy Spirit.”</p>
<p>73. Origen, too, in many of his expositions of the Psalms, we find using the form of
doxology “with the Holy Ghost.” The opinions which he held concerning the Spirit were
not always and everywhere sound; nevertheless in many passages even he himself reverently
recognises the force of established usage, and expresses himself concerning the Spirit in
terms consistent with true religion. It is, if I am not mistaken, in the Sixth1321 Book of his
Commentary on the Gospel of St. John that he distinctly makes the Spirit an object of worship.
His words are:—“The washing or water is a symbol of the cleaning of the soul which is
washed clean of all filth that comes of wickedness;1322 but none the less is it also by itself,
to him who yields himself to the God-head of the adorable Trinity, through the power of
the invocations, the origin and source of blessings.” And again, in his Exposition of the
Epistle to the Romans “the holy powers,” he says “are able to receive the Only-begotten, and
the Godhead of the Holy Spirit.” Thus I apprehend, the powerful influence of tradition
frequently impels men to express themselves in terms contradictory to their own opinions.

omitted portions, and St. Jerome thought that Rufinus had misrepresented it. Photius (Biblioth. cod. viii.) says

those terms, and are not ignorant of the grace of faith, render thanks to the Father, who
bestowed on us His own creatures, Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the world and our Lord, to

in a single syllable. Those however which I have quoted at length are out of the reach of
any dishonest manipulation, and can easily be verified from the actual works.</p>
<p>I will now adduce another piece of evidence which might perhaps seem insignificant,
but because of its antiquity must in nowise be omitted by a defendant who is indicted on a
charge of innovation. It seemed fitting to our fathers not to receive the gift of the light at
eventide in silence, but, on its appearing, immediately to give thanks. Who was the author
of these words of thanksgiving at the lighting of the lamps, we are not able to say. The
people, however, utter the ancient form, and no one has ever reckoned guilty of impiety
those who say “We praise Father, Son, and God’s Holy Spirit.”1325 And if any one knows
the Hymn of Athenogenes,1326 which, as he was hurrying on to his perfecting by fire, he
left as a kind of farewell gift1327 to his friends, he knows the mind of the martyrs as to the
Spirit. On this head I shall say no more.</p>

<p>74. But where shall I rank the great Gregory,1328 and the words uttered by him? Shall
we not place among Apostles and Prophets a man who walked by the same Spirit as they;1329
who never through all his days diverged from the footprints of the saints; who maintained,
as long as he lived, the exact principles of evangelical citizenship? I am sure that we shall
do the truth a wrong if we refuse to number that soul with the people of God, shining as it
did like a beacon in the Church of God; for by the fellow-working of the Spirit the power
which he had over demons was tremendous, and so gifted was he with the grace of the word
“for obedience to the faith among…the nations,”1330 that, although only seventeen Christians
were handed over to him, he brought the whole people alike in town and country through
knowledge to God. He too by Christ’s mighty name commanded even rivers to change their
course,1331 and caused a lake, which afforded a ground of quarrel to some covetous brethren,
to dry up.1332 Moreover his predictions of things to come were such as in no wise to fall
short of those of the great prophets. To recount all his wonderful works in detail would be
too long a task. By the superabundance of gifts, wrought in him by the Spirit in all power
and in signs and in marvels, he was styled a second Moses by the very enemies of the Church.
Thus in all that he through grace accomplished, alike by word and deed, a light seemed ever
to be shining, token of the heavenly power from the unseen which followed him. To this
day he is a great object of admiration to the people of his own neighbourhood, and his
memory, established in the churches ever fresh and green, is not dulled by length of time.
Thus not a practice, not a word, not a mystic rite has been added to the Church besides what
he bequeathed to it. Hence truly on account of the antiquity of their institution many of
their ceremonies appear to be defective.1333 For his successors in the administration of the
Churches could not endure to accept any subsequent discovery in addition to what had had
his sanction. Now one of the institutions of Gregory is the very form of the doxology to
which objection is now made, preserved by the Church on the authority of his tradition; a
statement which may be verified without much trouble by any one who likes to make a short

journey. That our Firmilian held this belief is testified by the writings which he has left.1334
The contemporaries also of the illustrious Meletius say that he was of this opinion. But why
quote ancient authorities? Now in the East are not the maintainers of true religion known
chiefly by this one term, and separated from their adversaries as by a watchword? I have
heard from a certain Mesopotamian, a man at once well skilled in the language and of unperverted
opinions, that by the usage of his country it is impossible for any one, even though
he may wish to do so, to express himself in any other way, and that they are compelled by
the idiom of their mother tongue to offer the doxology by the syllable “and,” or, I should
more accurately say, by their equivalent expressions. We Cappadocians, too, so speak in
the dialect of our country, the Spirit having so early as the division of tongues foreseen the
utility of the phrase. And what of the whole West, almost from Illyricum to the boundaries
of our world? Does it not support this word?</p>
<p>75. How then can I be an innovator and creator of new terms, when I adduce as originators
and champions of the word whole nations, cities, custom going back beyond the
memory of man, men who were pillars of the church and conspicuous for all knowledge
and spiritual power? For this cause this banded array of foes is set in motion against me,
and town and village and remotest regions are full of my calumniators. Sad and painful are
these things to them that seek for peace, but great is the reward of patience for sufferings
endured for the Faith’s sake. So besides these let sword flash, let axe be whetted, let fire burn
fiercer than that of Babylon, let every instrument of torture be set in motion against me.
To me nothing is more fearful than failure to fear the threats which the Lord has directed
against them that blaspheme the Spirit.1335 Kindly readers will find a satisfactory defence
in what I have said, that I accept a phrase so dear and so familiar to the saints, and confirmed
by usage so long, inasmuch as, from the day when the Gospel was first preached up to our
own time, it is shewn to have been admitted to all full rights within the churches, and, what
is of greatest moment, to have been accepted as bearing a sense in accordance with holiness
and true religion. But before the great tribunal what have I prepared to say in my defence?
This; that I was in the first place led to the glory of the Spirit by the honour conferred by
the Lord in associating Him with Himself and with His Father at baptism;1336 and secondly
by the introduction of each of us to the knowledge of God by such an initiation; and above
all by the fear of the threatened punishment shutting out the thought of all indignity and
unworthy conception. But our opponents, what will they say? After shewing neither rever-

ence for the Lord’s honour1337 nor fear of His threats, what kind of defence will they have
for their blasphemy? It is for them to make up their mind about their own action or even
now to change it. For my own part I would pray most earnestly that the good God will make
His peace rule in the hearts of all,1338 so that these men who are swollen with pride and set
in battle array against us may be calmed by the Spirit of meekness and of love; and that if
they have become utterly savage, and are in an untamable state, He will grant to us at least
to bear with long suffering all that we have to bear at their hands. In short “to them that
have in themselves the sentence of death,”1339 it is not suffering for the sake of the Faith
which is painful; what is hard to bear is to fail to fight its battle. The athlete does not so
much complain of being wounded in the struggle as of not being able even to secure admission
into the stadium. Or perhaps this was the time for silence spoken of by Solomon the
wise.1340 For, when life is buffeted by so fierce a storm that all the intelligence of those who
are instructed in the word is filled with the deceit of false reasoning and confounded, like
an eye filled with dust, when men are stunned by strange and awful noises, when all the
world is shaken and everything tottering to its fall, what profits it to cry, as I am really crying,
to the wind?</p>

<p>Exposition of the present state of the Churches.</p>
<p>76. To what then shall I liken our present condition? It may be compared, I think, to
some naval battle which has arisen out of time old quarrels, and is fought by men who
cherish a deadly hate against one another, of long experience in naval warfare, and eager
for the fight. Look, I beg you, at the picture thus raised before your eyes. See the rival fleets
rushing in dread array to the attack. With a burst of uncontrollable fury they engage and
fight it out. Fancy, if you like, the ships driven to and fro by a raging tempest, while thick
darkness falls from the clouds and blackens all the scenes so that watchwords are indistinguishable
in the confusion, and all distinction between friend and foe is lost. To fill up the
details of the imaginary picture, suppose the sea swollen with billows and whirled up from
the deep, while a vehement torrent of rain pours down from the clouds and the terrible
waves rise high. From every quarter of heaven the winds beat upon one point, where both
the fleets are dashed one against the other. Of the combatants some are turning traitors;
some are deserting in the very thick of the fight; some have at one and the same moment
to urge on their boats, all beaten by the gale, and to advance against their assailants. Jealousy
of authority and the lust of individual mastery splits the sailors into parties which deal mutual
death to one another. Think, besides all this, of the confused and unmeaning roar
sounding over all the sea, from howling winds, from crashing vessels, from boiling surf,
from the yells of the combatants as they express their varying emotions in every kind of
noise, so that not a word from admiral or pilot can be heard. The disorder and confusion
is tremendous, for the extremity of misfortune, when life is despaired of, gives men license
for every kind of wickedness. Suppose, too, that the men are all smitten with the incurable
plague of mad love of glory, so that they do not cease from their struggle each to get the
better of the other, while their ship is actually settling down into the deep.</p>
<p>77. Turn now I beg you from this figurative description to the unhappy reality. Did it
not at one time1341 appear that the Arian schism, after its separation into a sect opposed to
the Church of God, stood itself alone in hostile array? But when the attitude of our foes
against us was changed from one of long standing and bitter strife to one of open warfare,
then, as is well known, the war was split up in more ways than I can tell into many subdivisions,
so that all men were stirred to a state of inveterate hatred alike by common party

spirit and individual suspicion.1342 But what storm at sea was ever so fierce and wild as this
tempest of the Churches? In it every landmark of the Fathers has been moved; every
foundation, every bulwark of opinion has been shaken: everything buoyed up on the unsound
is dashed about and shaken down. We attack one another. We are overthrown by one another.
If our enemy is not the first to strike us, we are wounded by the comrade at our side.
If a foeman is stricken and falls, his fellow soldier tramples him down. There is at least this
bond of union between us that we hate our common foes, but no sooner have the enemy
gone by than we find enemies in one another. And who could make a complete list of all
the wrecks? Some have gone to the bottom on the attack of the enemy, some through the
unsuspected treachery of their allies, some from the blundering of their own officers. We
see, as it were, whole churches, crews and all, dashed and shattered upon the sunken reefs
of disingenuous heresy, while others of the enemies of the Spirit1343 of Salvation have seized
<note type="footnote">1342 In Ep. ccxlii. written in 376, St. Basil says: “This is the thirteenth year since the outbreak of the war of
heretics against us.” 363 is the date of the Acacian Council of Antioch; 364 of the accession of Valens and
Valentian, of the Semi-Arian Synod of Lampsacus, and of St. Basil’s ordination to the priesthood and book
against Eunomius. On the propagation by scission and innumerable subdivisions of Arianism Cannon Bright
writes: The extraordinary versatility, the argumentative subtlety, and the too frequent profanity of Arianism are
matters of which a few lines can give no idea. But it is necessary, in even the briefest notice of this long-lived
heresy, to remark on the contrast between its changeable inventiveness and the simple steadfastness of Catholic
doctrine. On the one side, some twenty different creeds (of which several, however, were rather negatively than
positively heterodox) and three main sects, the Semi-Arians, with their formula of Homoiousion, i.e. the Son is
like in essence to the Father; the Acacians, vaguely calling Him like (Homoion); the Aetians, boldly calling Him
unlike, as much as to say He is in no sense Divine. On the other side, the Church with the Nicene Creed, confessing
Him as Homoousion, ‘of one essence with the Father,’ meaning thereby, as her great champion repeatedly
bore witness, to secure belief in the reality of the Divine Sonship, and therefore in the real Deity, as distinguished
from the titular deity which was so freely conceded to Him by the Arians.” Cannon Bright, St. Leo on the Incarnation,

a.d. 341). 2. 2d of Antioch (omitted the ὁμοούσιον, a.d. 341). 3. The Creed brought to Constans in Gaul by

the helm and made shipwreck of the faith.1344 And then the disturbances wrought by the
princes of the world1345 have caused the downfall of the people with a violence unmatched
by that of hurricane or whirlwind. The luminaries of the world, which God set to give light
to the souls of the people, have been driven from their homes, and a darkness verily gloomy
and disheartening has settled on the Churches.1346 The terror of universal ruin is already
imminent, and yet their mutual rivalry is so unbounded as to blunt all sense of danger. Individual
hatred is of more importance than the general and common warfare, for men by
whom the immediate gratification of ambition is esteemed more highly than the rewards
that await us in a time to come, prefer the glory of getting the better of their opponents to
securing the common welfare of mankind. So all men alike, each as best he can, lift the
hand of murder against one another. Harsh rises the cry of the combatants encountering
one another in dispute; already all the Church is almost full of the inarticulate screams, the
unintelligible noises, rising from the ceaseless agitations that divert the right rule of the
doctrine of true religion, now in the direction of excess, now in that of defect. On the one
hand are they who confound the Persons and are carried away into Judaism;1347 on the
other hand are they that, through the opposition of the natures, pass into heathenism.1348
Between these opposite parties inspired Scripture is powerless to mediate; the traditions of
the apostles cannot suggest terms of arbitration. Plain speaking is fatal to friendship, and
disagreement in opinion all the ground that is wanted for a quarrel. No oaths of confederacy
are so efficacious in keeping men true to sedition as their likeness in error. Every one is a
theologue though he have his soul branded with more spots than can be counted. The result

<note type="footnote">1347 The identification of an unsound Monarchianism with Judaism is illustrated in the 1st Apology of Justin
Martyr, e.g. in § lxxxiii. (Reeves’ Trans.). “The Jews, therefore, for maintaining that it was the Father of the
Universe who had the conference with Moses, when it was the very Son of God who had it, and who is styled
both Angel and Apostle, are justly accused by the prophetic spirit and Christ Himself, for knowing neither the
Father nor the Son; for they who affirm the Son to be the Father are guilty of not knowing the Father, and likewise
of being ignorant that the Father of the Universe has a Son, who, being the Logos and First-begotten of God, is
God.”</note>

is that innovators find a plentiful supply of men ripe for faction, while self-appointed scions
of the house of place-hunters1349 reject the government1350 of the Holy Spirit and divide
the chief dignities of the Churches. The institutions of the Gospel have now everywhere
been thrown into confusion by want of discipline; there is an indescribable pushing for the
chief places while every self-advertiser tries to force himself into high office. The result of
this lust for ordering is that our people are in a state of wild confusion for lack of being
ordered;1351 the exhortations of those in authority are rendered wholly purposeless and
void, because there is not a man but, out of his ignorant impudence, thinks that it is just as
much his duty to give orders to other people, as it is to obey any one else.</p>
<p>78. So, since no human voice is strong enough to be heard in such a disturbance, I
reckon silence more profitable than speech, for if there is any truth in the words of the
Preacher, “The words of wise men are heard in quiet,”1352 in the present condition of things
any discussion of them must be anything but becoming. I am moreover restrained by the
Prophet’s saying, “Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time, for it is an evil
time,”1353 a time when some trip up their neighbours’ heels, some stamp on a man when
he is down, and others clap their hands with joy, but there is not one to feel for the fallen
and hold out a helping hand, although according to the ancient law he is not uncondemned,
who passes by even his enemy’s beast of burden fallen under his load.1354 This is not the
state of things now. Why not? The love of many has waxed cold;1355 brotherly concord is
destroyed, the very name of unity is ignored, brotherly admonitions are heard no more,
nowhere is there Christian pity, nowhere falls the tear of sympathy. Now there is no one
to receive “the weak in faith,”1356 but mutual hatred has blazed so high among fellow
clansmen that they are more delighted at a neighbour’s fall than at their own success. Just
as in a plague, men of the most regular lives suffer from the same sickness as the rest, because
they catch the disease by communication with the infected, so nowadays by the evil rivalry
which possesses our souls we are carried away to an emulation in wickedness, and are all of
us each as bad as the others. Hence merciless and sour sit the judges of the erring; unfeeling
and hostile are the critics of the well disposed. And to such a depth is this evil rooted among

but our most savage warfare is with our own people.</p>
<p>79. For all these reasons I ought to have kept silence, but I was drawn in the other direction
by love, which “seeketh not her own,”1357 and desires to overcome every difficulty
put in her way by time and circumstance. I was taught too by the children at Babylon,1358
that, when there is no one to support the cause of true religion, we ought alone and all unaided
to do our duty. They from out of the midst of the flame lifted up their voices in hymns
and praise to God, reeking not of the host that set the truth at naught, but sufficient, three
only that they were, with one another. Wherefore we too are undismayed at the cloud of
our enemies, and, resting our hope on the aid of the Spirit, have, with all boldness, proclaimed
the truth. Had I not so done, it would truly have been terrible that the blasphemers of the
Spirit should so easily be emboldened in their attack upon true religion, and that we, with
so mighty an ally and supporter at our side, should shrink from the service of that doctrine,
which by the tradition of the Fathers has been preserved by an unbroken sequence of memory
to our own day. A further powerful incentive to my undertaking was the warm fervour of
your “love unfeigned,”1359 and the seriousness and taciturnity of your disposition; a guarantee
that you would not publish what I was about to say to all the world,—not because it
would not be worth making known, but to avoid casting pearls before swine.1360 My task
is now done. If you find what I have said satisfactory, let this make an end to our discussion
of these matters. If you think any point requires further elucidation, pray do not hesitate
to pursue the investigation with all diligence, and to add to your information by putting

<head>Introduction to the Hexæmeron.</head>
<p>The Hexæmeron is the title of nine homilies delivered by St. Basil on the cosmogony of
the opening chapters of Genesis. When and where they were delivered is quite uncertain.
They are Lenten sermons, delivered at both the morning and evening services, and appear
to have been listened to by working men. (Hom. iii. 1.) Some words in Hom. viii. have
confirmed the opinion that they were preached extempore, in accordance with what is believed
to have been Basil’s ordinary practice.1361 Internal evidence points in the same direction,
for though a marked contrast might be expected between the style of a work intended
to be read, like the De Spiritu Sancto, and that of the orations to be spoken in public, the
Hexæmeron shews signs of being an unwritten composition.</p>
<p>In earlier ages, it was the most celebrated and admired of Basil’s works. Photius (Migne,
Pat. Gr. cxli) puts it first of all, and speaks warmly of its eloquence and force. As an example
of oratory he would rank it with the works of Plato and Demosthenes.</p>
<p>Suidas singles it out for special praise. Jerome (De Viris Illust.) among Basil’s works
names only the Hexæmeron, the De Sp. Scto, and the treatise Contra Eunomium.</p>
<p>That Basil’s friends should think highly of it is only what might be expected.
“Whenever I take his Hexæmeron in hand,” says Gregory of Nazianzus, (Orat. xliii. 67) “and
quote its words, I am brought face to face with my Creator: I begin to understand the
method of creation: I feel more awe than ever I did before, when I only looked at God’s
work with my eyes.”</p>
<p>Basil’s brother Gregory, in the Prooemium to his own Hexæmeron, speaks in exaggerated
terms of Basil’s work as inspired, and as being, in his opinion, as admirable as that of Moses.</p>
<p>The Hexæmeron of Ambrose is rather an imitation than a translation or adaptation of
that of Basil. Basil’s Hexæmeron was translated into Latin by Eustathius Afer (c. A.D. 440)
and is said to have been also translated by Dionysius Exiguus, the Scythian monk of the 6th
C. to whom is due our custom of dating from the Saviour’s birth.</p>
<p>More immediately interesting to English readers is the Anglo-Saxon abbreviation attributed
to Ælfric, Abbot of St. Albans in 969, and by some identified with the Ælfric who was
Archbishop of Canterbury from 996 to 1006. This is extant in a MS. numbered Junius 23
in the Bodleian Library, and was collated with the MS. Jun. 47 in the same, a transcript of
a MS. in the Hatton Collection, by the Rev. Henry W. Norman for his edition and translation
published in 1848. It is nowhere a literal translation, but combines with the thoughts of St.
Basil extracts from the Commentary upon Genesis of the Venerable Bede, as well as original
matter. It is entitled</p>

l’origine de l’homme, et peut-être n’ont ils pas fait jaillir une étincelle qui fût digne de la
vérité.’1362 Nous ne pouvons savoir ce que fut l’Hexaméron de Saint Hippolyte et nous ne
savons guère qu’une chose de celui d’Origène: c’est qu’il dénaturait completement le récit
mosaïque et n’y voyait que des allégories. L’Hexaméron de Saint Basile, par la pureté de la
doctrine et la beauté du style, fit disparaitre tous ceux qui l’avaient précéde.”1363 So, too,
bishop Fessler. “Sapienter, pie, et admodum eloquenter istæ homilæ confectæ sunt; quædam
explicationes physicæ profecto juxta placita scientiæ illius ætatis dijudicandæ sunt.”1364
On the other hand the prominence of the “scientiæ illius ætatis” is probably the reason why
the Hexæmeron has received from adverse critics less favour than it deserves. “Diese letztern,”
i.e. the Homilies in question, says Böhringer, “erlangten im Alterthum eine ganz
unverdiente Berühmtheit<gap reason="omitted"/>.Die Art, wie Basil seine Aufgabe löste, ist diese; er nimmt die
mosaische Erzählung von der Schöpfung Vers für Vers vor, erklärt sie von dem naturhistorischen
Standpunkt seiner Zeit aus, wobei er Gelegenheit nimmt, die Ansichten der griechischen
Philosophen von der Weltschöpfung u. s. w. zu widerlegen, und schliesst dann mit
moralischer und religiöser Nutzandwendung, um den Stoff auch für Geist und Herz seiner
Zuhörer fruchtbar zu machen. Es braucht indess kaum bemerkt zu werden, dass vom
naturwissenschaftlichen wie exegetischen Standpunkt unserer Zeit diese Arbeit wenig Werth
mehr hat.” The Three Cappadocians, p. 61. But in truth the fact that Basil is not ahead of
the science of his time is not to his discredit. It is to his credit that he is abreast with it; and
this, with the exception of his geography, he appears to be. Of him we may say, as Bp.
Lightfoot writes of St. Clement, in connexion with the crucial instance of the Phoenix, “it
appears that he is not more credulous than the most learned and intelligent heathen writers
of the preceding and following generations.” He reads the Book of Genesis in the light of
the scientific knowledge of his age, and in the amplification and illustration of Holy Scripture
by the supposed aid of this supposed knowledge, neither he nor his age stands alone. Later
centuries may possibly not accept all the science of the XIXth.</p>

<head>Homily I.</head>
<p>In the Beginning God made the Heaven and the Earth.</p>
<p>1. It is right that any one beginning to narrate the formation of the world should begin
with the good order which reigns in visible things. I am about to speak of the creation of
heaven and earth, which was not spontaneous, as some have imagined, but drew its origin
from God. What ear is worthy to hear such a tale? How earnestly the soul should prepare
itself to receive such high lessons! How pure it should be from carnal affections, how unclouded
by worldly disquietudes, how active and ardent in its researches, how eager to find
in its surroundings an idea of God which may be worthy of Him!</p>
<p>But before weighing the justice of these remarks, before examining all the sense contained
in these few words, let us see who addresses them to us. Because, if the weakness of our intelligence
does not allow us to penetrate the depth of the thoughts of the writer, yet we shall
be involuntarily drawn to give faith to his words by the force of his authority. Now it is
Moses who has composed this history; Moses, who, when still at the breast, is described as
exceeding fair;1365 Moses, whom the daughter of Pharaoh adopted; who received from her
a royal education, and who had for his teachers the wise men of Egypt;1366 Moses, who
disdained the pomp of royalty, and, to share the humble condition of his compatriots, preferred
to be persecuted with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting delights of
sin; Moses, who received from nature such a love of justice that, even before the leadership
of the people of God was committed to him, he was impelled, by a natural horror of evil, to
pursue malefactors even to the point of punishing them by death; Moses, who, banished by
those whose benefactor he had been, hastened to escape from the tumults of Egypt and took
refuge in Ethiopia, living there far from former pursuits, and passing forty years in the
contemplation of nature; Moses, finally, who, at the age of eighty, saw God, as far as it is
possible for man to see Him; or rather as it had not previously been granted to man to see
Him, according to the testimony of God Himself, “If there be a prophet among you, I the
Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream.
My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house, with him will I speak mouth
to mouth, even apparently and not in dark speeches.”1367 It is this man, whom God judged
worthy to behold Him, face to face, like the angels, who imparts to us what he has learnt
from God. Let us listen then to these words of truth written without the help of the “enticing

words of man’s wisdom”1368 by the dictation of the Holy Spirit; words destined to produce
not the applause of those who hear them, but the salvation of those who are instructed by
them.</p>
<p>2. “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”1369 I stop struck with admiration
at this thought. What shall I first say? Where shall I begin my story? Shall I show
forth the vanity of the Gentiles? Shall I exalt the truth of our faith? The philosophers of
Greece have made much ado to explain nature, and not one of their systems has remained
firm and unshaken, each being overturned by its successor. It is vain to refute them; they
are sufficient in themselves to destroy one another. Those who were too ignorant to rise to
a knowledge of a God, could not allow that an intelligent cause presided at the birth of the
Universe; a primary error that involved them in sad consequences. Some had recourse to
material principles and attributed the origin of the Universe1370 to the elements of the
world. Others imagined that atoms,1371 and indivisible bodies, molecules and ducts, form,
by their union, the nature of the visible world. Atoms reuniting or separating, produce
births and deaths and the most durable bodies only owe their consistency to the strength
of their mutual adhesion: a true spider’s web woven by these writers who give to heaven,
to earth, and to sea so weak an origin and so little consistency! It is because they knew not
how to say “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” Deceived by their inherent
atheism it appeared to them that nothing governed or ruled the universe, and that
was all was given up to chance.1372 To guard us against this error the writer on the creation,
from the very first words, enlightens our understanding with the name of God; “In the beginning
God created.” What a glorious order! He first establishes a beginning, so that it

might not be supposed that the world never had a beginning. Then he adds “Created” to
show that which was made was a very small part of the power of the Creator. In the same
way that the potter, after having made with equal pains a great number of vessels, has not
exhausted either his art or his talent; thus the Maker of the Universe, whose creative power,
far from being bounded by one world, could extend to the infinite, needed only the impulse
of His will to bring the immensities of the visible world into being. If then the world has a
beginning, and if it has been created, enquire who gave it this beginning, and who was the
Creator: or rather, in the fear that human reasonings may make you wander from the truth,
Moses has anticipated enquiry by engraving in our hearts, as a seal and a safeguard, the
awful name of God: “In the beginning God created”—It is He, beneficent Nature, Goodness
without measure, a worthy object of love for all beings endowed with reason, the beauty the
most to be desired, the origin of all that exists, the source of life, intellectual light, impenetrable
wisdom, it is He who “in the beginning created heaven and earth.”</p>
<p>3. Do not then imagine, O man! that the visible world is without a beginning; and because
the celestial bodies move in a circular course, and it is difficult for our senses to define
the point where the circle begins, do not believe that bodies impelled by a circular movement
are, from their nature, without a beginning. Without doubt the circle (I mean the plane
figure described by a single line) is beyond our perception, and it is impossible for us to find
out where it begins or where it ends; but we ought not on this account to believe it to be
without a beginning. Although we are not sensible of it, it really begins at some point where
the draughtsman has begun to draw it at a certain radius from the centre.1373 Thus seeing
that figures which move in a circle always return upon themselves, without for a single instant
interrupting the regularity of their course, do not vainly imagine to yourselves that the world
has neither beginning nor end. “For the fashion of this world passeth away”1374 and
“Heaven and earth shall pass away.”1375 The dogmas of the end, and of the renewing of the
world, are announced beforehand in these short words put at the head of the inspired history.
“In the beginning God made.” That which was begun in time is condemned to come to an
end in time. If there has been a beginning do not doubt of the end.1376 Of what use then
are geometry—the calculations of arithmetic—the study of solids and far-famed astronomy,
this laborious vanity, if those who pursue them imagine that this visible world is co-eternal
with the Creator of all things, with God Himself; if they attribute to this limited world, which
has a material body, the same glory as to the incomprehensible and invisible nature; if they

cannot conceive that a whole, of which the parts are subject to corruption and change, must
of necessity end by itself submitting to the fate of its parts? But they have become “vain in
their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise,
they became fools.”1377 Some have affirmed that heaven co-exists with God from all
eternity;1378 others that it is God Himself without beginning or end, and the cause of the
particular arrangement of all things.1379</p>
<p>4. One day, doubtless, their terrible condemnation will be the greater for all this worldly
wisdom, since, seeing so clearly into vain sciences, they have wilfully shut their eyes to the
knowledge of the truth. These men who measure the distances of the stars and describe
them, both those of the North, always shining brilliantly in our view, and those of the
southern pole visible to the inhabitants of the South, but unknown to us; who divide the
Northern zone and the circle of the Zodiac into an infinity of parts, who observe with exactitude
the course of the stars, their fixed places, their declensions, their return and the
time that each takes to make its revolution; these men, I say, have discovered all except one
thing: the fact that God is the Creator of the universe, and the just Judge who rewards all
the actions of life according to their merit. They have not known how to raise themselves
to the idea of the consummation of all things, the consequence of the doctrine of judgment,
and to see that the world must change if souls pass from this life to a new life. In reality, as
the nature of the present life presents an affinity to this world, so in the future life our souls
will enjoy a lot conformable to their new condition. But they are so far from applying these
truths, that they do but laugh when we announce to them the end of all things and the regeneration
of the age. Since the beginning naturally precedes that which is derived from it,
the writer, of necessity, when speaking to us of things which had their origin in time, puts
at the head of his narrative these words—“In the beginning God created.”</p>
<p>5. It appears, indeed, that even before this world an order of things1380 existed of which
our mind can form an idea, but of which we can say nothing, because it is too lofty a subject

for men who are but beginners and are still babes in knowledge. The birth of the world was
preceded by a condition of things suitable for the exercise of supernatural powers, outstripping
the limits of time, eternal and infinite. The Creator and Demiurge of the universe
perfected His works in it, spiritual light for the happiness of all who love the Lord, intellectual
and invisible natures, all the orderly arrangement1381 of pure intelligences who are
beyond the reach of our mind and of whom we cannot even discover the names. They fill
the essence of this invisible world, as Paul teaches us. “For by him were all things created
that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible whether they be thrones or
dominions or principalities or powers”1382 or virtues or hosts of angels or the dignities of
archangels. To this world at last it was necessary to add a new world, both a school and
training place where the souls of men should be taught and a home for beings destined to
be born and to die. Thus was created, of a nature analogous to that of this world and the
animals and plants which live thereon, the succession of time, for ever pressing on and
passing away and never stopping in its course. Is not this the nature of time, where the past
is no more, the future does not exist, and the present escapes before being recognised? And
such also is the nature of the creature which lives in time,—condemned to grow or to perish
without rest and without certain stability. It is therefore fit that the bodies of animals and
plants, obliged to follow a sort of current, and carried away by the motion which leads them
to birth or to death, should live in the midst of surroundings whose nature is in accord with
beings subject to change.1383 Thus the writer who wisely tells us of the birth of the Universe
does not fail to put these words at the head of the narrative. “In the beginning God created;”
that is to say, in the beginning of time. Therefore, if he makes the world appear in the beginning,
it is not a proof that its birth has preceded that of all other things that were made.
He only wishes to tell us that, after the invisible and intellectual world, the visible world,
the world of the senses, began to exist.</p>
<p>The first movement is called beginning. “To do right is the beginning of the good
way.”1384 Just actions are truly the first steps towards a happy life. Again, we call “beginning”
the essential and first part from which a thing proceeds, such as the foundation of a house,
the keel of a vessel; it is in this sense that it is said, “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of

wisdom,”1385 that is to say that piety is, as it were, the groundwork and foundation of perfection.
Art is also the beginning of the works of artists, the skill of Bezaleel began the adornment
of the tabernacle.1386 Often even the good which is the final cause is the beginning
of actions. Thus the approbation of God is the beginning of almsgiving, and the end laid
up for us in the promises the beginning of all virtuous efforts.</p>
<p>6. Such being the different senses of the word beginning, see if we have not all the
meanings here. You may know the epoch when the formation of this world began, it, ascending
into the past, you endeavour to discover the first day. You will thus find what was
the first movement of time; then that the creation of the heavens and of the earth were like
the foundation and the groundwork, and afterwards that an intelligent reason, as the word
beginning indicates, presided in the order of visible things.1387 You will finally discover
that the world was not conceived by chance and without reason, but for an useful end and
for the great advantage of all beings, since it is really the school where reasonable souls exercise
themselves, the training ground where they learn to know God; since by the sight of
visible and sensible things the mind is led, as by a hand, to the contemplation of invisible
things. “For,” as the Apostle says, “the invisible things of him from the creation of the world
are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.”1388 Perhaps these words
“In the beginning God created” signify the rapid and imperceptible moment of creation.
The beginning, in effect, is indivisible and instantaneous. The beginning of the road is not
yet the road, and that of the house is not yet the house; so the beginning of time is not yet
time and not even the least particle of it. If some objector tell us that the beginning is a time,
he ought then, as he knows well, to submit it to the division of time—a beginning, a middle
and an end. Now it is ridiculous to imagine a beginning of a beginning. Further, if we divide
the beginning into two, we make two instead of one, or rather make several, we really make
an infinity, for all that which is divided is divisible to the infinite.1389 Thus then, if it is said,

“In the beginning God created,” it is to teach us that at the will of God the world arose in
less than an instant, and it is to convey this meaning more clearly that other interpreters
have said: “God made summarily” that is to say all at once and in a moment.1390 But enough
concerning the beginning, if only to put a few points out of many.</p>
<p>7. Among arts, some have in view production, some practice, others theory.1391 The
object of the last is the exercise of thought, that of the second, the motion of the body.
Should it cease, all stops; nothing more is to be seen. Thus dancing and music have nothing
behind; they have no object but themselves. In creative arts on the contrary the work lasts
after the operation. Such is architecture—such are the arts which work in wood and brass
and weaving, all those indeed which, even when the artisan has disappeared, serve to show
an industrious intelligence and to cause the architect, the worker in brass or the weaver, to
be admired on account of his work. Thus, then, to show that the world is a work of art dis-
played for the beholding of all people; to make them know Him who created it, Moses does
not use another word. “In the beginning,” he says “God created.” He does not say “God
worked,” “God formed,” but “God created.” Among those who have imagined that the
world co-existed with God from all eternity, many have denied that it was created by God,
but say that it exists spontaneously, as the shadow of this power. God, they say, is the cause
of it, but an involuntary cause, as the body is the cause of the shadow and the flame is the
cause of the brightness.1392 It is to correct this error that the prophet states, with so much
precision, “In the beginning God created.” He did not make the thing itself the cause of its
existence.1393 Being good, He made it an useful work. Being wise, He made it everything
that was most beautiful. Being powerful He made it very great.1394 Moses almost shows
us the finger of the supreme artisan taking possession of the substance of the universe,

forming the different parts in one perfect accord, and making a harmonious symphony
result from the whole.1395</p>
<p>“In the beginning God made heaven and earth.” By naming the two extremes, he suggests
the substance of the whole world, according to heaven the privilege of seniority, and putting
earth in the second rank. All intermediate beings were created at the same time as the extremities.
Thus, although there is no mention of the elements, fire, water and air,1396 imagine
that they were all compounded together, and you will find water, air and fire, in the earth.
For fire leaps out from stones; iron which is dug from the earth produces under friction fire
in plentiful measure. A marvellous fact! Fire shut up in bodies lurks there hidden without
harming them, but no sooner is it released than it consumes that which has hitherto preserved
it. The earth contains water, as diggers of wells teach us. It contains air too, as is shown by
the vapours that it exhales under the sun’s warmth1397 when it is damp. Now, as according
to their nature, heaven occupies the higher and earth the lower position in space, (one sees,
in fact, that all which is light ascends towards heaven, and heavy substances fall to the
ground); as therefore height and depth are the points the most opposed to each other it is
enough to mention the most distant parts to signify the inclusion of all which fills up intervening
Space. Do not ask, then, for an enumeration of all the elements; guess, from what
Holy Scripture indicates, all that is passed over in silence.</p>
<p>8. “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” If we were to wish to discover
the essence of each of the beings which are offered for our contemplation, or come
under our senses, we should be drawn away into long digressions, and the solution of the
problem would require more words than I possess, to examine fully the matter. To spend
time on such points would not prove to be to the edification of the Church. Upon the essence
of the heavens we are contented with what Isaiah says, for, in simple language, he gives us
sufficient idea of their nature, “The heaven was made like smoke,”1398 that is to say, He
created a subtle substance, without solidity or density, from which to form the heavens. As
to the form of them we also content ourselves with the language of the same prophet, when
praising God “that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent
to dwell in.”1399 In the same way, as concerns the earth, let us resolve not to torment
ourselves by trying to find out its essence, not to tire our reason by seeking for the substance

which it conceals. Do not let us seek for any nature devoid of qualities by the conditions of
its existence, but let us know that all the phenomena with which we see it clothed regard
the conditions of its existence and complete its essence. Try to take away by reason each of
the qualities it possesses, and you will arrive at nothing. Take away black, cold, weight,
density, the qualities which concern taste, in one word all these which we see in it, and the
substance vanishes.1400</p>
<p>If I ask you to leave these vain questions, I will not expect you to try and find out the
earth’s point of support. The mind would reel on beholding its reasonings losing themselves
without end. Do you say that the earth reposes on a bed of air?1401 How, then, can this soft
substance, without consistency, resist the enormous weight which presses upon it? How is
it that it does not slip away in all directions, to avoid the sinking weight, and to spread itself
over the mass which overwhelms it? Do you suppose that water is the foundation of the
earth?1402 You will then always have to ask yourself how it is that so heavy and opaque a
body does not pass through the water; how a mass of such a weight is held up by a nature
weaker than itself. Then you must seek a base for the waters, and you will be in much difficulty
to say upon what the water itself rests.</p>
<p>9. Do you suppose that a heavier body prevents the earth from falling into the abyss?
Then you must consider that this support needs itself a support to prevent it from falling.
Can we imagine one? Our reason again demands yet another support, and thus we shall
fall into the infinite, always imagining a base for the base which we have already found.1403
And the further we advance in this reasoning the greater force we are obliged to give to this
base, so that it may be able to support all the mass weighing upon it. Put then a limit to

your thought, so that your curiosity in investigating the incomprehensible may not incur
the reproaches of Job, and you be not asked by him, “Whereupon are the foundations
thereof fastened?”1404 If ever you hear in the Psalms, “I bear up the pillars of it;”1405 see in
these pillars the power which sustains it. Because what means this other passage, “He hath
founded it upon the sea,”1406 if not that the water is spread all around the earth? How then
can water, the fluid element which flows down every declivity, remain suspended without
ever flowing? You do not reflect that the idea of the earth suspended by itself throws your
reason into a like but even greater difficulty, since from its nature it is heavier. But let us
admit that the earth rests upon itself, or let us say that it rides the waters, we must still remain
faithful to thought of true religion and recognise that all is sustained by the Creator’s power.
Let us then reply to ourselves, and let us reply to those who ask us upon what support this
enormous mass rests, “In His hands are the ends of the earth.”1407 It is a doctrine as infallible
for our own information as profitable for our hearers.</p>
<p>10. There are inquirers into nature1408 who with a great display of words give reasons
for the immobility of the earth. Placed, they say, in the middle of the universe and not being
able to incline more to one side than the other because its centre is everywhere the same
distance from the surface, it necessarily rests upon itself; since a weight which is everywhere
equal cannot lean to either side. It is not, they go on, without reason or by chance that the
earth occupies the centre of the universe. It is its natural and necessary position. As the
celestial body occupies the higher extremity of space all heavy bodies, they argue, that we
may suppose to have fallen from these high regions, will be carried from all directions to
the centre, and the point towards which the parts are tending will evidently be the one to
which the whole mass will be thrust together. If stones, wood, all terrestrial bodies, fall from
above downwards, this must be the proper and natural place of the whole earth. If, on the
contrary, a light body is separated from the centre, it is evident that it will ascend towards
the higher regions. Thus heavy bodies move from the top to the bottom, and following this
reasoning, the bottom is none other than the centre of the world. Do not then be surprised
that the world never falls: it occupies the centre of the universe, its natural place. By necessity
it is obliged to remain in its place, unless a movement contrary to nature should displace
it.1409 If there is anything in this system which might appear probable to you, keep your

<p>11. We might say the same thing of the heavens. With what a noise of words the sages
of this world have discussed their nature! Some have said that heaven is composed of four
elements as being tangible and visible, and is made up of earth on account of its power of
resistance, with fire because it is striking to the eye, with air and water on account of the
mixture.1410 Others have rejected this system as improbable, and introduced into the world,
to form the heavens, a fifth element after their own fashioning. There exists, they say, an
æthereal body which is neither fire, air, earth, nor water, nor in one word any simple body.
These simple bodies have their own natural motion in a straight line, light bodies upwards
and heavy bodies downwards; now this motion upwards and downwards is not the same
as circular motion; there is the greatest possible difference between straight and circular
motion. It therefore follows that bodies whose motion is so various must vary also in their
essence. But, it is not even possible to suppose that the heavens should be formed of primitive
bodies which we call elements, because the reunion of contrary forces could not produce
an even and spontaneous motion, when each of the simple bodies is receiving a different
impulse from nature. Thus it is a labour to maintain composite bodies in continual movement,
because it is impossible to put even a single one of their movements in accord and
harmony with all those that are in discord; since what is proper to the light particle, is in
warfare with that of a heavier one. If we attempt to rise we are stopped by the weight of the
terrestrial element; if we throw ourselves down we violate the igneous part of our being in
dragging it down contrary to its nature. Now this struggle of the elements effects their dissolution.
A body to which violence is done and which is placed in opposition to nature,
after a short but energetic resistance, is soon dissolved into as many parts as it had elements,
each of the constituent parts returning to its natural place. It is the force of these reasons,
say the inventors of the fifth kind of body for the genesis of heaven and the stars, which
constrained them to reject the system of their predecessors and to have recourse to their
own hypothesis.1411 But yet another fine speaker arises and disperses and destroys this
theory to give predominance to an idea of his own invention.</p>

<p>“The Earth was Invisible and Unfinished.”1412</p>
<p>1. In the few words which have occupied us this morning we have found such a depth
of thought that we despair of penetrating further. If such is the fore court of the sanctuary,
if the portico of the temple is so grand and magnificent, if the splendour of its beauty thus
dazzles the eyes of the soul, what will be the holy of holies? Who will dare to try to gain
access to the innermost shrine? Who will look into its secrets? To gaze into it is indeed
forbidden us, and language is powerless to express what the mind conceives. However,
since there are rewards, and most desirable ones, reserved by the just Judge for the intention
alone of doing good, do not let us hesitate to continue our researches. Although we may
not attain to the truth, if, with the help of the Spirit, we do not fall away from the meaning
of Holy Scripture we shall not deserve to be rejected, and, with the help of grace, we shall
contribute to the edification of the Church of God.</p>
<p>“The earth,” says Holy Scripture, “was invisible and unfinished.” The heavens and the
earth were created without distinction. How then is it that the heavens are perfect whilst
the earth is still unformed and incomplete? In one word, what was the unfinished condition
of the earth? And for what reason was it invisible? The fertility of the earth is its perfect
finishing; growth of all kinds of plants, the upspringing of tall trees, both productive and
sterile, flowers’ sweet scents and fair colours, and all that which, a little later, at the voice of
God came forth from the earth to beautify her, their universal Mother. As nothing of all
this yet existed, Scripture is right in calling the earth “without form.” We could also say of
the heavens that they were still imperfect and had not received their natural adornment,
since at that time they did not shine with the glory of the sun and of the moon and were not
crowned by the choirs of the stars.1413 These bodies were not yet created. Thus you will
not diverge from the truth in saying that the heavens also were “without form.” The earth
was invisible for two reasons: it may be because man, the spectator, did not yet exist, or
because being submerged under the waters which over-flowed the surface, it could not be
seen, since the waters had not yet been gathered together into their own places, where God
afterwards collected them, and gave them the name of seas. What is invisible? First of all
that which our fleshly eye cannot perceive; our mind, for example; then that which, visible
in its nature, is hidden by some body which conceals it, like iron in the depths of the earth.
It is in this sense, because it was hidden under the waters, that the earth was still invisible.

However, as light did not yet exist, and as the earth lay in darkness, because of the obscurity
of the air above it, it should not astonish us that for this reason Scripture calls it “invisible.”</p>
<p>2. But the corrupters of the truth, who, incapable of submitting their reason to Holy
Scripture, distort at will the meaning of the Holy Scriptures, pretend that these words mean
matter. For it is matter, they say, which from its nature is without form and invisible,—being
by the conditions of its existence without quality and without form and figure. 1414 The
Artificer submitting it to the working of His wisdom clothed it with a form, organized it,
and thus gave being to the visible world.</p>
<p>If matter is uncreated, it has a claim to the same honours as God, since it must be of
equal rank with Him. Is this not the summit of wickedness, that an extreme deformity,
without quality, without form, shape, ugliness without configuration, to use their own expression,
should enjoy the same prerogatives with Him, Who is wisdom, power and beauty
itself, the Creator and the Demiurge of the universe? This is not all. If matter is so great as
to be capable of being acted on by the whole wisdom of God, it would in a way raise its hypostasis
to an equality with the inaccessible power of God, since it would be able to measure
by itself all the extent of the divine intelligence. If it is insufficient for the operations of God,
then we fall into a more absurd blasphemy, since we condemn God for not being able, on
account of the want of matter, to finish His own works. The poverty of human nature has
deceived these reasoners. Each of our crafts is exercised upon some special matter—the art
of the smith upon iron, that of the carpenter on wood. In all, there is the subject, the form
and the work which results from the form. Matter is taken from without—art gives the
form—and the work is composed at the same time of form and of matter.1415</p>
<p>Such is the idea that they make for themselves of the divine work. The form of the world
is due to the wisdom of the supreme Artificer; matter came to the Creator from without;
and thus the world results from a double origin. It has received from outside its matter and

its essence, and from God its form and figure.1416 They thus come to deny that the mighty
God has presided at the formation of the universe, and pretend that He has only brought a
crowning contribution to a common work, that He has only contributed some small portion
to the genesis of beings: they are incapable from the debasement of their reasonings of
raising their glances to the height of truth. Here below arts are subsequent to matter—introduced
into life by the indispensable need of them. Wool existed before weaving made it
supply one of nature’s imperfections. Wood existed before carpentering took possession
of it, and transformed it each day to supply new wants, and made us see all the advantages
derived from it, giving the oar to the sailor, the winnowing fan to the labourer, the lance to
the soldier. But God, before all those things which now attract our notice existed, after
casting about in His mind and determining to bring into being time which had no being,
imagined the world such as it ought to be, and created matter in harmony with the form
which He wished to give it.1417 He assigned to the heavens the nature adapted for the
heavens, and gave to the earth an essence in accordance with its form. He formed, as He
wished, fire, air and water, and gave to each the essence which the object of its existence
required. Finally, He welded all the diverse parts of the universe by links of indissoluble
attachment and established between them so perfect a fellowship and harmony that the
most distant, in spite of their distance, appeared united in one universal sympathy. Let
those men therefore renounce their fabulous imaginations, who, in spite of the weakness
of their argument, pretend to measure a power as incomprehensible to man’s reason as it
is unutterable by man’s voice.</p>
<p>3. God created the heavens and the earth, but not only half;—He created all the heavens
and all the earth, creating the essence with the form. For He is not an inventor of figures,
but the Creator even of the essence of beings. Further let them tell us how the efficient
power of God could deal with the passive nature of matter, the latter furnishing the matter
without form, the former possessing the science of the form without matter, both being in
need of each other; the Creator in order to display His art, matter in order to cease to be
without form and to receive a form.1418 But let us stop here and return to our subject.</p>

<p>“The earth was invisible and unfinished.” In saying “In the beginning God created the
heavens and the earth,” the sacred writer passed over many things in silence, water, air, fire
and the results from them, which, all forming in reality the true complement of the world,
were, without doubt, made at the same time as the universe. By this silence, history wishes
to train the activity or our intelligence, giving it a weak point for starting, to impel it to the
discovery of the truth. Thus, we are not told of the creation of water; but, as we are told
that the earth was invisible, ask yourself what could have covered it, and prevented it from
being seen? Fire could not conceal it. Fire brightens all about it, and spreads light rather
than darkness around. No more was it air that enveloped the earth. Air by nature is of little
density and transparent. It receives all kinds of visible object, and transmits them to the
spectators. Only one supposition remains; that which floated on the surface of the earth
was water—the fluid essence which had not yet been confined to its own place. Thus the
earth was not only invisible; it was still incomplete. Even today excessive damp is a hindrance
to the productiveness of the earth. The same cause at the same time prevents it from being
seen, and from being complete, for the proper and natural adornment of the earth is its
completion: corn waving in the valleys—meadows green with grass and rich with many
coloured flowers—fertile glades and hill-tops shaded by forests. Of all this nothing was yet
produced; the earth was in travail with it in virtue of the power that she had received from
the Creator. But she was waiting for the appointed time and the divine order to bring forth.</p>

lumined, the shadow produced by the interposition of a body, or finally a place for some
reason deprived of light. For them “darkness” is an evil power, or rather the personification
of evil, having his origin in himself in opposition to, and in perpetual struggle with, the
goodness of God. If God is light, they say, without any doubt the power which struggles
against Him must be darkness, “Darkness” not owing its existence to a foreign origin, but
an evil existing by itself. “Darkness” is the enemy of souls, the primary cause of death, the
adversary of virtue. The words of the Prophet, they say in their error, show that it exists

<p>O man, why wander thus from the truth, and imagine for thyself that which will cause
thy perdition? The word is simple and within the comprehension of all. “The earth was
invisible.” Why? Because the “deep” was spread over its surface. What is “the deep”? A
mass of water of extreme depth. But we know that we can see many bodies through clear
and transparent water. How then was it that no part of the earth appeared through the
water? Because the air which surrounded it was still without light and in darkness. The
rays of the sun, penetrating the water, often allow us to see the pebbles which form the bed
of the river, but in a dark night it is impossible for our glance to penetrate under the water.
Thus, these words “the earth was invisible” are explained by those that follow; “the deep”
covered it and itself was in darkness. Thus, the deep is not a multitude of hostile powers,
as has been imagined;1423 nor “darkness” an evil sovereign force in enmity with good. In
reality two rival principles of equal power, if engaged without ceasing in a war of mutual

attacks, will end in self destruction. But if one should gain the mastery it would completely
annihilate the conquered. Thus, to maintain the balance in the struggle between good and
evil is to represent them as engaged in a war without end and in perpetual destruction, where
the opponents are at the same time conquerors and conquered. If good is the stronger, what
is there to prevent evil being completely annihilated? But if that be the case, the very utterance
of which is impious, I ask myself how it is that they themselves are not filled with horror to
think that they have imagined such abominable blasphemies.</p>
<p>It is equally impious to say that evil has its origin from God;1424 because the contrary
cannot proceed from its contrary. Life does not engender death; darkness is not the origin
of light; sickness is not the maker of health.1425 In the changes of conditions there are
transitions from one condition to the contrary; but in genesis each being proceeds from its
like, and not from its contrary. If then evil is neither uncreate nor created by God, from
whence comes its nature? Certainly that evil exists, no one living in the world will deny.
What shall we say then? Evil is not a living animated essence; it is the condition of the soul
opposed to virtue, developed in the careless on account of their falling away from good.1426</p>

κακόν as punitive and remedial; if the latter can rightly be called evil in any sense, God is the author of it. cf.

<p>5. Do not then go beyond yourself to seek for evil, and imagine that there is an original
nature of wickedness. Each of us, let us acknowledge it, is the first author of his own vice.
Among the ordinary events of life, some come naturally, like old age and sickness, others
by chance like unforeseen occurrences, of which the origin is beyond ourselves, often sad,
sometimes fortunate, as for instance the discovery of a treasure when digging a well, or the
meeting of a mad dog when going to the market place. Others depend upon ourselves, such
as ruling one’s passions, or not putting a bridle on one’s pleasures, to be master of our anger,
or to raise the hand against him who irritates us, to tell the truth, or to lie, to have a sweet
and well-regulated disposition, or to be fierce and swollen and exalted with pride.1427 Here
you are the master of your actions. Do not look for the guiding cause beyond yourself, but
recognise that evil, rightly so called, has no other origin than our voluntary falls. If it were
involuntary, and did not depend upon ourselves, the laws would not have so much terror
for the guilty, and the tribunals would not be so without pity when they condemn wretches
according to the measure of their crimes. But enough concerning evil rightly so called.
Sickness, poverty, obscurity, death, finally all human afflictions, ought not to be ranked as
evils; since we do not count among the greatest boons things which are their opposites.1428
Among these afflictions, some are the effect of nature, others have obviously been for many
a source of advantage. Let us then be silent for the moment about these metaphors and allegories,
and, simply following without vain curiosity the words of Holy Scripture, let us
take from darkness the idea which it gives us.</p>
<p>But reason asks, was darkness created with the world? Is it older than light? Why in
spite of its inferiority has it preceded it? Darkness, we reply, did not exist in essence; it is a
condition produced in the air by the withdrawal of light. What then is that light which
disappeared suddenly from the world, so that darkness should cover the face of the deep?
If anything had existed before the formation of this sensible and perishable world, no doubt
we conclude it would have been in light. The orders of angels, the heavenly hosts, all intellectual
natures named or unnamed, all the ministering spirits,1429 did not live in darkness,
but enjoyed a condition fitted for them in light and spiritual joy.1430</p>

<p>No one will contradict this; least of all he who looks for celestial light as one of the rewards
promised to virtue, the light which, as Solomon says, is always a light to the righteous,
1431 the light which made the Apostle say “Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath
made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.”1432 Finally, if the
condemned are sent into outer darkness1433 evidently those who are made worthy of God’s
approval, are at rest in heavenly light. When then, according to the order of God, the
heaven appeared, enveloping all that its circumference included, a vast and unbroken body
separating outer things from those which it enclosed, it necessarily kept the space inside in
darkness for want of communication with the outer light. Three things are, indeed, needed
to form a shadow, light, a body, a dark place. The shadow of heaven forms the darkness of
the world. Understand, I pray you, what I mean, by a simple example; by raising for yourself
at mid-day a tent of some compact and impenetrable material, and shutting yourself up in
it in sudden darkness. Suppose that original darkness was like this, not subsisting directly
by itself, but resulting from some external causes. If it is said that it rested upon the deep,
it is because the extremity of air naturally touches the surface of bodies; and as at that time
the water covered everything, we are obliged to say that darkness was upon the face of the
deep.</p>
<p>6. And the Spirit of God was borne upon the face of the waters.1434 Does this spirit mean
the diffusion of air? The sacred writer wishes to enumerate to you the elements of the world,
to tell you that God created the heavens, the earth, water, and air and that the last was now
diffused and in motion; or rather, that which is truer and confirmed by the authority of the
ancients, by the Spirit of God, he means the Holy Spirit. It is, as has been remarked, the
special name, the name above all others that Scripture delights to give to the Holy Spirit,
and always by the spirit of God the Holy Spirit is meant, the Spirit which completes the divine
and blessed Trinity. You will find it better therefore to take it in this sense. How then did
the Spirit of God move upon the waters? The explanation that I am about to give you is not
an original one, but that of a Syrian,1435 who was as ignorant in the wisdom of this world
as he was versed in the knowledge of the Truth. He said, then, that the Syriac word was

more expressive, and that being more analogous to the Hebrew term it was a nearer approach
to the scriptural sense. This is the meaning of the word; by “was borne” the Syrians, he says,
understand: it cherished1436 the nature of the waters as one sees a bird cover the eggs with
her body and impart to them vital force from her own warmth. Such is, as nearly as possible,
the meaning of these words—the Spirit was borne: let us understand, that is, prepared the
nature of water to produce living beings:1437 a sufficient proof for those who ask if the Holy
Spirit took an active part in the creation of the world.</p>
<p>7. And God said, Let there be light.1438 The first word of God created the nature of
light; it made darkness vanish, dispelled gloom, illuminated the world, and gave to all beings
at the same time a sweet and gracious aspect. The heavens, until then enveloped in darkness,
appeared with that beauty which they still present to our eyes. The air was lighted up, or
rather made the light circulate mixed with its substance, and, distributing its splendour
rapidly in every direction, so dispersed itself to its extreme limits. Up it sprang to the very
æther and heaven. In an instant it lighted up the whole extent of the world, the North and
the South, the East and the West. For the æther also is such a subtle substance and so
transparent that it needs not the space of a moment for light to pass through it. Just as it
carries our sight instantaneously to the object of vision,1439 so without the least interval,
with a rapidity that thought cannot conceive, it receives these rays of light in its uttermost
limits. With light the æther becomes more pleasing and the waters more limpid. These
last, not content with receiving its splendour, return it by the reflection of light and in all
directions send forth quivering flashes. The divine word gives every object a more cheerful
and a more attractive appearance, just as when men in deep sea pour in oil they make the

gave the boon of light to the world.1440</p>
<p>Let there be light. The order was itself an operation, and a state of things was brought
into being, than which man’s mind cannot even imagine a pleasanter one for our enjoyment.
It must be well understood that when we speak of the voice, of the word, of the command
of God, this divine language does not mean to us a sound which escapes from the organs
of speech, a collision of air1441 struck by the tongue; it is a simple sign of the will of God,
and, if we give it the form of an order, it is only the better to impress the souls whom we
instruct.1442</p>
<p>And God saw the light, that it was good.1443 How can we worthily praise light after the
testimony given by the Creator to its goodness? The word, even among us, refers the judgment
to the eyes, incapable of raising itself to the idea that the senses have already re-
ceived.1444 But, if beauty in bodies results from symmetry of parts, and the harmonious
appearance of colours, how in a simple and homogeneous essence like light, can this idea
of beauty be preserved? Would not the symmetry in light be less shown in its parts than in
the pleasure and delight at the sight of it? Such is also the beauty of gold, which it owes not
to the happy mingling of its parts, but only to its beautiful colour which has a charm attractive
to the eyes.</p>

<p>Thus again, the evening star is the most beautiful of the stars:1445 not that the parts of
which it is composed form a harmonious whole; but thanks to the unalloyed and beautiful
brightness which meets our eyes. And further, when God proclaimed the goodness of light,
it was not in regard to the charm of the eye but as a provision for future advantage, because
at that time there were as yet no eyes to judge of its beauty. “And God divided the light from
the darkness;”1446 that is to say, God gave them natures incapable of mixing, perpetually in
opposition to each other, and put between them the widest space and distance.</p>
<p>8. “And God called the light Day and the darkness he called Night.”1447 Since the birth
of the sun, the light that it diffuses in the air, when shining on our hemisphere, is day; and
the shadow produced by its disappearance is night. But at that time it was not after the
movement of the sun, but following this primitive light spread abroad in the air or withdrawn
in a measure determined by God, that day came and was followed by night.</p>
<p>“And the evening and the morning were the first day.”1448 Evening is then the boundary
common to day and night; and in the same way morning constitutes the approach of night
to day. It was to give day the privileges of seniority that Scripture put the end of the first
day before that of the first night, because night follows day: for, before the creation of light,
the world was not in night, but in darkness. It is the opposite of day which was called night,
and it did not receive its name until after day. Thus were created the evening and the
morning.1449 Scripture means the space of a day and a night, and afterwards no more says
day and night, but calls them both under the name of the more important: a custom which
you will find throughout Scripture. Everywhere the measure of time is counted by days,
without mention of nights. “The days of our years,”1450 says the Psalmist. “Few and evil
have the days of the years of my life been,”1451 said Jacob, and elsewhere “all the days of my
life.”1452 Thus under the form of history the law is laid down for what is to follow. And
the evening and the morning were one day.1453 Why does Scripture say “one day the first
day”? Before speaking to us of the second, the third, and the fourth days, would it not have

been more natural to call that one the first which began the series? If it therefore says “one
day,” it is from a wish to determine the measure of day and night, and to combine the time
that they contain. Now twenty-four hours fill up the space of one day—we mean of a day
and of a night; and if, at the time of the solstices, they have not both an equal length, the
time marked by Scripture does not the less circumscribe their duration. It is as though it
said: twenty-four hours measure the space of a day, or that, in reality a day is the time that
the heavens starting from one point take to return there. Thus, every time that, in the revolution
of the sun, evening and morning occupy the world, their periodical succession
never exceeds the space of one day. But must we believe in a mysterious reason for this?
God who made the nature of time measured it out and determined it by intervals of days;
and, wishing to give it a week as a measure, he ordered the week to revolve from period to
period upon itself, to count the movement of time, forming the week of one day revolving
seven times upon itself: a proper circle begins and ends with itself. Such is also the character
of eternity, to revolve upon itself and to end nowhere. If then the beginning of time is called
“one day” rather than “the first day,” it is because Scripture wishes to establish its relationship
with eternity. It was, in reality, fit and natural to call “one” the day whose character is to be
one wholly separated and isolated from all the others. If Scripture speaks to us of many
ages, saying everywhere, “age of age, and ages of ages,” we do not see it enumerate them as
first, second, and third. It follows that we are hereby shown not so much limits, ends and
succession of ages, as distinctions between various states and modes of action. “The day of
the Lord,” Scripture says, “is great and very terrible,”1454 and elsewhere “Woe unto you that
desire the day of the Lord: to what end is it for you? The day of the Lord is darkness and
not light.”1455 A day of darkness for those who are worthy of darkness. No; this day without
evening, without succession and without end is not unknown to Scripture, and it is the day
that the Psalmist calls the eighth day, because it is outside this time of weeks.1456 Thus
whether you call it day, or whether you call it eternity, you express the same idea. Give this
state the name of day; there are not several, but only one. If you call it eternity still it is
unique and not manifold. Thus it is in order that you may carry your thoughts forward
towards a future life, that Scripture marks by the word “one” the day which is the type of
eternity, the first fruits of days, the contemporary of light, the holy Lord’s day honoured by
the Resurrection of our Lord. And the evening and the morning were one day.”</p>

<p>1. We have now recounted the works of the first day, or rather of one day. Far be it
from me indeed, to take from it the privilege it enjoys of having been for the Creator a day
apart, a day which is not counted in the same order as the others. Our discussion yesterday
treated of the works of this day, and divided the narrative so as to give you food for your
souls in the morning, and joy in the evening. To-day we pass on to the wonders of the
second day. And here I do not wish to speak of the narrator’s talent, but of the grace of
Scripture, for the narrative is so naturally told that it pleases and delights all the friends of
truth. It is this charm of truth which the Psalmist expresses so emphatically when he says,
“How sweet are thy words unto my taste, yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth.”1458 Yesterday
then, as far as we were able, we delighted our souls by conversing about the oracles
of God, and now to-day we are met together again on the second day to contemplate the
wonders of the second day.</p>

difficulties may trouble you the Lord will disperse them. To those who have preferred
spiritual welfare, He will give health of body, keenness of mind, success in business, and
unbroken prosperity. And, even if in this life our efforts should not realise our hopes, the
teachings of the Holy Spirit are none the less a rich treasure for the ages to come. Deliver
your heart, then, from the cares of this life and give close heed to my words. Of what avail
will it be to you if you are here in the body, and your heart is anxious about your earthly

<p>2. And God said “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide
the waters from the waters.”1459 Yesterday we heard God’s decree, “Let there be light.” Today
it is, “Let there be a firmament.” There appears to be something more in this. The word
is not limited to a simple command. It lays down the reason necessitating the structure of
the firmament: it is, it is said, to separate the waters from the waters. And first let us ask
how God speaks? Is it in our manner? Does His intelligence receive an impression from
objects, and, after having conceived them, make them known by particular signs appropriate
to each of them? Has He consequently recourse to the organs of voice to convey His
thoughts? Is He obliged to strike the air by the articulate movements of the voice, to unveil
<note type="footnote">1458 Ps. cxix. 103.</note>
<note type="footnote">1459 Gen. i. 6.</note>

<pb n="279"/>
the thought hidden in His heart? Would it not seem like an idle fable to say that God should
need such a circuitous method to manifest His thoughts? And is it not more conformable
with true religion to say, that the divine will and the first impetus of divine intelligence are
the Word of God? It is He whom Scripture vaguely represents, to show us that God has not
only wished to create the world, but to create it with the help of a co-operator. Scripture
might continue the history as it is begun: In the beginning God created the heaven and the
earth; afterwards He created light, then He created the firmament. But, by making God
command and speak, the Scripture tacitly shows us Him to Whom this order and these
words are addressed.1460 It is not that it grudges us the knowledge of the truth, but that it
may kindle our desire by showing us some trace and indication of the mystery. We seize
with delight, and carefully keep, the fruit of laborious efforts, whilst a possession easily attained
is despised.1461 Such is the road and the course which Scripture follows to lead us
to the idea of the Only begotten. And certainly, God’s immaterial nature had no need of
the material language of voice, since His very thoughts could be transmitted to His fellowworker.
What need then of speech, for those Who by thought alone could communicate
their counsels to each other? Voice was made for hearing, and hearing for voice. Where
there is neither air, nor tongue, nor ear, nor that winding canal which carries sounds to the
seat of sensation in the head, there is no need for words: thoughts of the soul are sufficient
to transmit the will. As I said then, this language is only a wise and ingenious contrivance
to set our minds seeking the Person to whom the words are addressed.</p>
<p>3. In the second place, does the firmament that is called heaven differ from the firmament
that God made in the beginning? Are there two heavens? The philosophers, who discuss
heaven, would rather lose their tongues than grant this. There is only one heaven,1462 they
pretend; and it is of a nature neither to admit of a second, nor of a third, nor of several
others. The essence of the celestial body quite complete constitutes its vast unity. Because,
they say, every body which has a circular motion is one and finite. And if this body is used
in the construction of the first heaven, there will be nothing left for the creation of a second

or a third. Here we see what those imagine who put under the Creator’s hand uncreated
matter; a lie that follows from the first fable. But we ask the Greek sages not to mock us
before they are agreed among themselves. Because there are among them some who say
there are infinite heavens and worlds.1463 When grave demonstrations shall have upset
their foolish system, when the laws of geometry shall have established that, according to the
nature of heaven, it is impossible that there should be two, we shall only laugh the more at
this elaborate scientific trifling. These learned men see not merely one bubble but several
bubbles formed by the same cause, and they doubt the power of creative wisdom to bring
several heavens into being! We find, however, if we raise our eyes towards the omnipotence
of God, that the strength and grandeur of the heavens differ from the drops of water bubbling
on the surface of a fountain. How ridiculous, then, is their argument of impossibility! As
for myself, far from not believing in a second, I seek for the third whereon the blessed Paul
was found worthy to gaze.1464 And does not the Psalmist in saying “heaven of heavens”1465
give us an idea of their plurality? Is the plurality of heaven stranger than the seven circles
through which nearly all the philosophers agree that the seven planets pass,—circles which
they represent to us as placed in connection with each other like casks fitting the one into
the other? These circles, they say, carried away in a direction contrary to that of the world,
and striking the æther, make sweet and harmonious sounds, unequalled by the sweetest
melody.1466 And if we ask them for the witness of the senses, what do they say? That we,
accustomed to this noise from our birth, on account of hearing it always, have lost the sense
of it; like men in smithies with their ears incessantly dinned. If I refuted this ingenious

frivolity, the untruth of which is evident from the first word, it would seem as though I did
not know the value of time, and mistrusted the intelligence of such an audience.</p>
<p>But let me leave the vanity of outsiders to those who are without, and return to the
theme proper to the Church. If we believe some of those who have preceded us, we have
not here the creation of a new heaven, but a new account of the first. The reason they give
is, that the earlier narrative briefly described the creation of heaven and earth; while here
scripture relates in greater detail the manner in which each was created. I, however, since
Scripture gives to this second heaven another name and its own function, maintain that it
is different from the heaven which was made at the beginning; that it is of a stronger nature
and of an especial use to the universe.</p>
<p>4. “And God said, let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide
the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which
were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament.”1467 Before
laying hold of the meaning of Scripture let us try to meet objections from other quarters.
We are asked how, if the firmament is a spherical body, as it appears to the eye, its convex
circumference can contain the water which flows and circulates in higher regions? What
shall we answer? One thing only: because the interior of a body presents a perfect concavity
it does not necessarily follow that its exterior surface is spherical and smoothly rounded.
Look at the stone vaults of baths, and the structure of buildings of cave form; the dome,
which forms the interior, does not prevent the roof from having ordinarily a flat surface.
Let these unfortunate men cease, then, from tormenting us and themselves about the impossibility
of our retaining water in the higher regions.</p>
<p>Now we must say something about the nature of the firmament, and why it received
the order to hold the middle place between the waters. Scripture constantly makes use of
the word firmament to express extraordinary strength. “The Lord my firmament and
refuge.”1468 “I have strengthened the pillars of it.”1469 “Praise him in the firmament of his
power.”1470 The heathen writers thus call a strong body one which is compact and full,1471
to distinguish it from the mathematical body. A mathematical body is a body which exists
only in the three dimensions, breadth, depth, and height. A firm body, on the contrary,
adds resistance to the dimensions. It is the custom of Scripture to call firmament all that is
strong and unyielding. It even uses the word to denote the condensation of the air: He, it

says, who strengthens the thunder.1472 Scripture means by the strengthening of the thunder,
the strength and resistance of the wind, which, enclosed in the hollows of the clouds, produces
the noise of thunder when it breaks through with violence.1473 Here then, according to me,
is a firm substance, capable of retaining the fluid and unstable element water; and as, according
to the common acceptation, it appears that the firmament owes its origin to water, we
must not believe that it resembles frozen water or any other matter produced by the filtration
of water; as, for example, rock crystal, which is said to owe its metamorphosis to excessive
congelation,1474 or the transparent stone1475 which forms in mines.1476 This pellucid stone,
if one finds it in its natural perfection, without cracks inside, or the least spot of corruption,
almost rivals the air in clearness. We cannot compare the firmament to one of these substances.
To hold such an opinion about celestial bodies would be childish and foolish; and
although everything may be in everything, fire in earth, air in water, and of the other elements
the one in the other; although none of those which come under our senses are pure and
without mixture, either with the element which serves as a medium for it, or with that which
is contrary to it; I, nevertheless, dare not affirm that the firmament was formed of one of
these simple substances, or of a mixture of them, for I am taught by Scripture not to allow
my imagination to wander too far afield. But do not let us forget to remark that, after these
divine words “let there be a firmament,” it is not said “and the firmament was made” but,
“and God made the firmament, and divided the waters.”1477 Hear, O ye deaf! See, O ye
blind!—who, then, is deaf? He who does not hear this startling voice of the Holy Spirit.

be a firmament.” It is the voice of the primary and principal Cause. “And God made the
firmament.” Here is a witness to the active and creative power of God.</p>
<p>5. But let us continue our explanation: “Let it divide the waters from the waters.”1479
The mass of waters, which from all directions flowed over the earth, and was suspended in
the air, was infinite, so that there was no proportion between it and the other elements.
Thus, as it has been already said, the abyss covered the earth. We give the reason for this
abundance of water. None of you assuredly will attack our opinion; not even those who
have the most cultivated minds, and whose piercing eye can penetrate this perishable and
fleeting nature; you will not accuse me of advancing impossible or imaginary theories, nor
will you ask me upon what foundation the fluid element rests. By the same reason which
makes them attract the earth, heavier than water, from the extremities of the world to suspend
it in the centre, they will grant us without doubt that it is due both to its natural attraction
downwards and its general equilibrium, that this immense quantity of water rests motionless
upon the earth.1480 Therefore the prodigious mass of waters was spread around the earth;
not in proportion with it and infinitely larger, thanks to the foresight of the supreme Artificer,
Who, from the beginning, foresaw what was to come, and at the first provided all for the
future needs of the world. But what need was there for this superabundance of water? The
essence of fire is necessary for the world, not only in the economy of earthly produce, but
for the completion of the universe; for it would be imperfect1481 if the most powerful and
the most vital of its elements were lacking.1482 Now fire and water are hostile to and destructive
of each other. Fire, if it is the stronger, destroys water, and water, if in greater
abundance, destroys fire. As, therefore, it was necessary to avoid an open struggle between
these elements, so as not to bring about the dissolution of the universe by the total disappearance
of one or the other, the sovereign Disposer created such a quantity of water that
in spite of constant diminution from the effects of fire, it could last until the time fixed for
the destruction of the world. He who planned all with weight and measure, He who, according
to the word of Job, knows the number of the drops of rain,1483 knew how long His work
would last, and for how much consumption of fire He ought to allow. This is the reason of

the abundance of water at the creation. Further, there is no one so strange to life as to need
to learn the reason why fire is essential to the world. Not only all the arts which support
life, the art of weaving, that of shoemaking, of architecture, of agriculture, have need of the
help of fire, but the vegetation of trees, the ripening of fruits, the breeding of land and water
animals, and their nourishment, all existed from heat from the beginning, and have been
since maintained by the action of heat. The creation of heat was then indispensable for the
formation and the preservation of beings, and the abundance of waters was no less so in the
presence of the constant and inevitable consumption by fire.</p>
<p>6. Survey creation; you will see the power of heat reigning over all that is born and
perishes. On account of it comes all the water spread over the earth, as well as that which
is beyond our sight and is dispersed in the depths of the earth. On account of it are abundance
of fountains, springs or wells, courses of rivers, both mountain torrents and ever
flowing streams, for the storing of moisture in many and various reservoirs. From the East,
from the winter solstice flows the Indus, the greatest river of the earth, according to geographers.
From the middle of the East proceed the Bactrus,1484 the Choaspes,1485 and the
Araxes,1486 from which the Tanais1487 detaches itself to fall into the Palus-Mæotis.1488
Add to these the Phasis1489 which descends from Mount Caucasus, and countless other
rivers, which, from northern regions, flow into the Euxine Sea. From the warm countries
of the West, from the foot of the Pyrenees, arise the Tartessus1490 and the Ister,1491 of which
the one discharges itself into the sea beyond the Pillars and the other, after flowing through
Europe, falls into Euxine Sea. Is there any need to enumerate those which the Ripæan
mountains1492 pour forth in the heart of Scythia, the Rhone,1493 and so many other rivers,
all navigable, which after having watered the countries of the western Gauls and of Celts
and of the neighbouring barbarians, flow into the Western sea? And others from the higher
regions of the South flow through Ethiopia, to discharge themselves some into our sea,

others into inaccessible seas, the Ægon1494 the Nyses, the Chremetes,1495 and above all the
Nile, which is not of the character of a river when, like a sea, it inundates Egypt. Thus the
habitable part of our earth is surrounded by water, linked together by vast seas and irrigated
by countless perennial rivers, thanks to the ineffable wisdom of Him Who ordered all to
prevent this rival element to fire from being entirely destroyed.</p>
<p>However, a time will come, when all shall be consumed by fire; as Isaiah says of the God
of the universe in these words, “That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy
rivers.”1496 Reject then the foolish wisdom of this world,1497 and receive with me the more
simple but infallible doctrine of truth.</p>
<p>7. Therefore we read: “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it
divide the waters from the waters.” I have said what the word firmament in Scripture means.
It is not in reality a firm and solid substance which has weight and resistance; this name
would otherwise have better suited the earth. But, as the substance of superincumbent
bodies is light, without consistency, and cannot be grasped by any one of our senses, it is in
comparison with these pure and imperceptible substances that the firmament has received
its name. Imagine a place fit to divide the moisture, sending it, if pure and filtered, into
higher regions, and making it fall, if it is dense and earthy; to the end that by the gradual
withdrawal of the moist particles the same temperature may be preserved from the beginning
to the end. You do not believe in this prodigious quantity of water; but you do not take into
account the prodigious quantity of heat, less considerable no doubt in bulk, but exceedingly
powerful nevertheless, if you consider it as destructive of moisture. It attracts surrounding
moisture, as the melon shows us, and consumes it as quickly when attracted, as the flame
of the lamp draws to it the fuel supplied by the wick and burns it up. Who doubts that the
æther is an ardent fire?1498 If an impassable limit had not been assigned to it by the Creator,
what would prevent it from setting on fire and consuming all that is near it, and absorbing

l’indifférence des cités grecques de l’ Asie pour cet Occident lointain dont elles se séparèrent si facilement.” If this

all the moisture from existing things? The aerial waters which veil the heavens with vapours
that are sent forth by rivers, fountains, marshes, lakes, and seas, prevent the æther from invading
and burning up the universe. Thus we see even this sun, in the summer season, dry
up in a moment a damp and marshy country, and make it perfectly arid. What has become
of all the water? Let these masters of omniscience tell us. Is it not plain to every one that it
has risen in vapour, and has been consumed by the heat of the sun? They say, none the less,
that even the sun is without heat. What time they lose in words! And see what proof they
lean upon to resist what is perfectly plain. Its colour is white, and neither reddish nor yellow.
It is not then fiery by nature, and its heat results, they say, from the velocity of its rotation.
1499 What do they gain? That the sun does not seem to absorb moisture? I do not,
however, reject this statement, although it is false, because it helps my argument. I said that
the consumption of heat required this prodigious quantity of water. That the sun owes its
heat to its nature, or that heat results from its action, makes no difference, provided that it
produces the same effects upon the same matter. If you kindle fire by rubbing two pieces
of wood together, or if you light them by holding them to a flame, you will have absolutely
the same effect. Besides, we see that the great wisdom of Him who governs all, makes the
sun travel from one region to another, for fear that, if it remained always in the same place,
its excessive heat would destroy the order of the universe. Now it passes into southern regions
about the time of the winter solstice, now it returns to the sign of the equinox; from thence
it betakes itself to northern regions during the summer solstice, and keeps up by this imperceptible
passage a pleasant temperature throughout all the world.</p>
<p>Let the learned people see if they do not disagree among themselves. The water which
the sun consumes is, they say, what prevents the sea from rising and flooding the rivers; the
warmth of the sun leaves behind the salts and the bitterness of the waters, and absorbs from
them the pure and drinkable particles,1500 thanks to the singular virtue of this planet in attracting
all that is light and in allowing to fall, like mud and sediment, all which is thick and
earthy. From thence come the bitterness, the salt taste and the power of withering and
drying up which are characteristic of the sea. While as is notorious, they hold these views,
they shift their ground and say that moisture cannot be lessened by the sun.1501</p>

the visible region called heaven, on account of the density and continuity of the air within
our ken, and deriving its name “heaven” from the word which means to see.1503 It is of it
that Scripture says, “The fowl of the air,”1504 “Fowl that may fly<gap reason=" omitted"/>in the open firmament
of heaven;”1505 and, elsewhere, “They mount up to heaven.”1506 Moses, blessing the tribe
of Joseph, desires for it the fruits and the dews of heaven, of the suns of summer and the
conjunctions of the moon, and blessings from the tops of the mountains and from the
everlasting hills,1507 in one word, from all which fertilises the earth. In the curses on Israel
it is said, “And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass.”1508 What does this mean?
It threatens him with a complete drought, with an absence of the aerial waters which cause
the fruits of the earth to be brought forth and to grow.</p>
<p>Since, then, Scripture says that the dew or the rain falls from heaven, we understand
that it is from those waters which have been ordered to occupy the higher regions. When
the exhalations from the earth, gathered together in the heights of the air, are condensed
under the pressure of the wind, this aerial moisture diffuses itself in vaporous and light
clouds; then mingling again, it forms drops which fall, dragged down by their own weight;
and this is the origin of rain. When water beaten by the violence of the wind, changes into
foam, and passing through excessive cold quite freezes, it breaks the cloud, and falls as
snow.1509 You can thus account for all the moist substances that the air suspends over our
heads.</p>
<p>And do not let any one compare with the inquisitive discussions of philosophers upon
the heavens, the simple and inartificial character of the utterances of the Spirit; as the beauty

our opponents. They only seek to persuade by forced reasoning. With us truth presents
itself naked and without artifice. But why torment ourselves to refute the errors of philosophers,
when it is sufficient to produce their mutually contradictory books, and, as quiet
spectators, to watch the war?1511 For those thinkers are not less numerous, nor less celebrated,
nor more sober in speech in fighting their adversaries, who say that the universe is
being consumed by fire, and that from the seeds which remain in the ashes of the burnt
world all is being brought to life again. Hence in the world there is destruction and palingenesis
to infinity.1512 All, equally far from the truth, find each on their side by-ways which
lead them to error.</p>
<p>9. But as far as concerns the separation of the waters I am obliged to contest the opinion
of certain writers in the Church1513 who, under the shadow of high and sublime conceptions,
have launched out into metaphor, and have only seen in the waters a figure to denote spiritual
and incorporeal powers. In the higher regions, above the firmament, dwell the better;
in the lower regions, earth and matter are the dwelling place of the malignant. So, say they,
God is praised by the waters that are above the heaven, that is to say, by the good powers,
the purity of whose soul makes them worthy to sing the praises of God. And the waters
which are under the heaven represent the wicked spirits, who from their natural height have
fallen into the abyss of evil. Turbulent, seditious, agitated by the tumultuous waves of passion,
they have received the name of sea, because of the instability and the inconstancy of their
movements.1514 Let us reject these theories as dreams and old women’s tales. Let us understand
that by water water is meant; for the dividing of the waters by the firmament let us
accept the reason which has been given us. Although, however, waters above the heaven
are invited to give glory to the Lord of the Universe, do not let us think of them as intelligent
beings; the heavens are not alive because they “declare the glory of God,” nor the firmament
a sensible being because it “sheweth His handiwork.”1515 And if they tell you that the
heavens mean contemplative powers, and the firmament active powers which produce good,
we admire the theory as ingenious without being able to acknowledge the truth of it. For

thus dew, the frost, cold and heat, which in Daniel are ordered to praise the Creator of all
things,1516 will be intelligent and invisible natures. But this is only a figure, accepted as
such by enlightened minds, to complete the glory of the Creator. Besides, the waters above
the heavens, these waters privileged by the virtue which they possess in themselves, are not
the only waters to celebrate the praises of God. “Praise the Lord from the earth, ye dragons
and all deeps.”1517 Thus the singer of the Psalms does not reject the deeps which our inventors
of allegories rank in the divisions of evil; he admits them to the universal choir of creation,
and the deeps sing in their language a harmonious hymn to the glory of the Creator.</p>
<p>10. “And God saw that it was good.” God does not judge of the beauty of His work by
the charm of the eyes, and He does not form the same idea of beauty that we do. What He
esteems beautiful is that which presents in its perfection all the fitness1518 of art, and that
which tends to the usefulness of its end. He, then, who proposed to Himself a manifest
design in His works, approved each one of them, as fulfilling its end in accordance with His
creative purpose. A hand, an eye, or any portion of a statue lying apart from the rest, would
look beautiful to no one. But if each be restored to its own place, the beauty of proportion,
until now almost unperceived, would strike even the most uncultivated. But the artist, before
uniting the parts of his work, distinguishes and recognises the beauty of each of them,
thinking of the object that he has in view. It is thus that Scripture depicts to us the Supreme
Artist, praising each one of His works; soon, when His work is complete, He will accord
well deserved praise to the whole together. Let me here end my discourse on the second

<p>Upon the gathering together of the waters.</p>
<p>1. There are towns where the inhabitants, from dawn to eve, feast their eyes on the
tricks of innumerable conjurors. They are never tired of hearing dissolute songs which
cause much impurity to spring up in their souls, and they are often called happy, because
they neglect the cares of business and trades useful to life, and pass the time, which is assigned
to them on this earth, in idleness and pleasure. They do not know that a theatre full of impure
sights is, for those who sit there, a common school of vice; that these melodious and meretricious
songs insinuate themselves into men’s souls, and all who hear them, eager to imitate
the notes1520 of harpers and pipers, are filled with filthiness.1521 Some others, who are wild
after horses, think they are backing their horses in their dreams; they harness their chariots,
change their drivers, and even in sleep are not free from the folly of the day.1522 And shall
we, whom the Lord, the great worker of marvels, calls to the contemplation of His own
works, tire of looking at them, or be slow to hear the words of the Holy Spirit? Shall we not
rather stand around the vast and varied workshop of divine creation and, carried back in
mind to the times of old, shall we not view all the order of creation? Heaven, poised like a
dome, to quote the words of the prophet;1523 earth, this immense mass which rests upon
itself; the air around it, of a soft and fluid nature, a true and continual nourishment for all
who breathe it, of such tenuity that it yields and opens at the least movement of the body,
opposing no resistance to our motions, while, in a moment, it streams back to its place, behind
those who cleave it; water, finally, that supplies drink for man, or may be designed for
our other needs, and the marvellous gathering together of it into definite places which have
been assigned to it: such is the spectacle which the words which I have just read will show
you.</p>

together of the waters called He seas.”1524 What trouble you have given me in my previous
discourses by asking me why the earth was invisible, why all bodies are naturally endued
with colour, and why all colour comes under the sense of sight. And, perhaps, my reason
did not appear sufficient to you, when I said that the earth, without being naturally invisible,
was so to us, because of the mass of water that entirely covered it. Hear then how Scripture
explains itself. “Let the waters be gathered together, and let the dry land appear.” The veil
is lifted and allows the earth, hitherto invisible, to be seen. Perhaps you will ask me new
questions. And first, is it not a law of nature that water flows downwards? Why, then, does
Scripture refer this to the fiat of the Creator? As long as water is spread over a level surface,
it does not flow; it is immovable. But when it finds any slope, immediately the foremost
portion falls, then the one that follows takes its place, and that one is itself replaced by a
third. Thus incessantly they flow, pressing the one on the other, and the rapidity of their
course is in proportion to the mass of water that is being carried, and the declivity down
which it is borne. If such is the nature of water, it was supererogatory to command it to
gather into one place. It was bound, on account of its natural instability, to fall into the
most hollow part of the earth and not to stop until the levelling of its surface. We see how
there is nothing so level as the surface of water. Besides, they add, how did the waters receive
an order to gather into one place, when we see several seas, separated from each other by
the greatest distances? To the first question I reply: Since God’s command, you know perfectly
well the motion of water; you know that it is unsteady and unstable and falls naturally
over declivities and into hollow places. But what was its nature before this command made
it take its course? You do not know yourself, and you have heard from no eye-witness.
Think, in reality, that a word of God makes the nature, and that this order is for the creature
a direction for its future course. There was only one creation of day and night, and since
that moment they have incessantly succeeded each other and divided time into equal parts.</p>
<p>3. “Let the waters be gathered together.” It was ordered that it should be the natural
property of water to flow, and in obedience to this order, the waters are never weary in their
course. In speaking thus, I have only in view the flowing property of waters. Some flow of
their own accord like springs and rivers, others are collected and stationary. But I speak
now of flowing waters. “Let the waters be gathered together unto one place.” Have you
never thought, when standing near a spring which is sending forth water abundantly, Who
makes this water spring from the bowels of the earth? Who forced it up? Where are the
store-houses which send it forth? To what place is it hastening? How is it that it is never
exhausted here, and never overflows there? All this comes from that first command; it was
for the waters a signal for their course.</p>
<note type="footnote">1524 Gen. i. 9, 10.</note>

<pb n="293"/>
<p>In all the story of the waters remember this first order, “let the waters be gathered together.”
To take their assigned places they were obliged to flow, and, once arrived there, to
remain in their place and not to go farther. Thus in the language of Ecclesiastes, “All the
waters run into the sea; yet the sea is not full.”1525 Waters flow in virtue of God’s order,
and the sea is enclosed in limits according to this first law, “Let the waters be gathered together
unto one place.” For fear the water should spread beyond its bed, and in its successive
invasions cover one by one all countries, and end by flooding the whole earth, it received
the order to gather unto one place. Thus we often see the furious sea raising mighty waves
to the heaven, and, when once it has touched the shore, break its impetuosity in foam and
retire. “Fear ye not me, saith the Lord.<gap reason=" omitted"/>which have placed the sand for the bound of the
sea.”1526 A grain of sand, the weakest thing possible, curbs the violence of the ocean. For
what would prevent the Red Sea from invading the whole of Egypt, which lies lower, and
uniting itself to the other sea which bathes its shores, were it not fettered by the fiat of the
Creator? And if I say that Egypt is lower than the Red Sea, it is because experience has
convinced us of it every time that an attempt has been made to join the sea of Egypt1527 to
the Indian Ocean, of which the Red Sea is a part.1528 Thus we have renounced this enterprise,
as also have the Egyptian Sesostris, who conceived the idea, and Darius the Mede who afterwards
wished to carry it out.1529</p>
<p>I report this fact to make you understand the full force of the command, “Let the waters
be gathered unto one place”; that is to say, let there be no other gathering, and, once gathered,
let them not disperse.</p>
<p>4. To say that the waters were gathered in one place indicates that previously they were
scattered in many places. The mountains, intersected by deep ravines, accumulated water

in their valleys, when from every direction the waters betook themselves to the one gathering
place. What vast plains, in their extent resembling wide seas, what valleys, what cavities
hollowed in many different ways, at that time full of water, must have been emptied by the
command of God! But we must not therefore say, that if the water covered the face of the
earth, all the basins which have since received the sea were originally full. Where can the
gathering of the waters have come from if the basins were already full? These basins, we
reply, were only prepared at the moment when the water had to unite in a single mass. At
that time the sea which is beyond Gadeira1530 and the vast ocean, so dreaded by navigators,
which surrounds the isle of Britain and western Spain, did not exist. But, all of a sudden,
God created this vast space, and the mass of waters flowed in.</p>
<p>Now if our explanation of the creation of the world may appear contrary to experience,
(because it is evident that all the waters did not flow together in one place,) many answers
may be made, all obvious as soon as they are stated. Perhaps it is even ridiculous to reply
to such objections. Ought they to bring forward in opposition ponds and accumulations
of rain water, and think that this is enough to upset our reasonings? Evidently the chief and
most complete affluence of the waters was what received the name of gathering unto one
place. For wells are also gathering places for water, made by the hand of man to receive the
moisture diffused in the hollow of the earth. This name of gathering does not mean any
chance massing of water, but the greatest and most important one, wherein the element is
shewn collected together. In the same way that fire, in spite of its being divided into minute
particles which are sufficient for our needs here, is spread in a mass in the æther; in the same
way that air, in spite of a like minute division, has occupied the region round the earth; so
also water, in spite of the small amount spread abroad everywhere, only forms one gathering
together, that which separates the whole element from the rest. Without doubt the lakes as
well those of the northern regions and those that are to be found in Greece, in Macedonia,
in Bithynia and in Palestine, are gatherings together of waters; but here it means the greatest
of all, that gathering the extent of which equals that of the earth. The first contain a great
quantity of water; no one will deny this. Nevertheless no one could reasonably give them
the name of seas, not even if they are like the great sea, charged with salt and sand. They
instance for example, the Lacus Asphaltitis in Judæa, and the Serbonian lake which extends
between Egypt and Palestine in the Arabian desert. These are lakes, and there is only one
sea, as those affirm who have travelled round the earth. Although some authorities think
the Hyrcanian and Caspian Seas are enclosed in their own boundaries, if we are to believe
the geographers, they communicate with each other and together discharge themselves into
<note type="footnote">1530 i.e. Cadiz, a corruption of Gadeira, which, like Geder and Gadara, is connected with the Phoenician
Gadir, an enclosure.</note>

<pb n="295"/>
the Great Sea.1531 It is thus that, according to their account, the Red Sea and that beyond
Gadeira only form one. Then why did God call the different masses of water seas? This is
the reason; the waters flowed into one place, and their different accumulations, that is to
say, the gulfs that the earth embraced in her folds, received from the Lord the name of seas:
North Sea, South Sea, Eastern Sea, and Western Sea. The seas have even their own names,
the Euxine, the Propontis, the Hellespont, the Ægean, the Ionian, the Sardinian, the Sicilian,
the Tyrrhene, and many other names of which an exact enumeration would now be too
long, and quite out of place. See why God calls the gathering together of waters seas. But
let us return to the point from which the course of my argument has diverted me.</p>
<p>5. And God said: “Let the waters be gathered together unto one place and let the dry
land appear.” He did not say let the earth appear, so as not to show itself again without
form, mud-like, and in combination with the water, nor yet endued with proper form and
virtue. At the same time, lest we should attribute the drying of the earth to the sun, the
Creator shows it to us dried before the creation of the sun. Let us follow the thought
Scripture gives us. Not only the water which was covering the earth flowed off from it, but
all that which had filtered into its depths withdrew in obedience to the irresistible order of
the sovereign Master. And it was so. This is quite enough to show that the Creator’s voice
had effect: however, in several editions, there is added “And the water which was under the
heavens gathered itself unto one place and the dry land was seen;” words that other interpreters
have not given, and which do not appear conformable to Hebrew usage. In fact,
after the assertion, “and it was so,” it is superfluous to repeat exactly the same thing. In accurate
copies these words are marked with an obelus,1532 which is the sign of rejection.</p>
<p>“And God called the dry land earth; and the gathering together of the waters called He
seas.”1533 Why does Scripture say above that the waters were gathered together unto one
place, and that the dry earth appeared? Why does it add here the dry land appeared, and
God gave it the name of earth? It is that dryness is the property which appears to characterize
the nature of the subject, whilst the word earth is only its simple name. Just as reason is the
distinctive faculty of man, and the word man serves to designate the being gifted with this
faculty, so dryness is the special and peculiar quality of the earth. The element essentially
dry receives therefore the name of earth, as the animal who has a neigh for a characteristic
cry is called a horse. The other elements, like the earth, have received some peculiar property

which distinguishes them from the rest, and makes them known for what they are. Thus
water has cold for its distinguishing property; air, moisture; fire, heat. But this theory really
applies only to the primitive elements of the world. The elements which contribute to the
formation of bodies, and come under our senses, show us these qualities in combination,
and in the whole of nature our eyes and senses can find nothing which is completely singular,
simple and pure. Earth is at the same time dry and cold; water, cold and moist; air, moist
and warm; fire, warm and dry. It is by the combination of their qualities that the different
elements can mingle. Thanks to a common quality each of them mixes with a neighbouring
element, and this natural alliance attaches it to the contrary element. For example, earth,
which is at the same time dry and cold, finds in cold a relationship which unites it to water,
and by the means of water unites itself to air. Water placed between the two, appears to
give each a hand, and, on account of its double quality, allies itself to earth by cold and to
air by moisture. Air, in its turn, takes the middle place and plays the part of a mediator
between the inimical natures of water and fire, united to the first by moisture, and to the
second by heat. Finally fire, of a nature at the same time warm and dry, is linked to air by
warmth, and by its dryness reunites itself to the earth. And from this accord and from this
mutual mixture of elements, results a circle and an harmonious choir whence each of the
elements deserves its name. I have said this in order to explain why God has given to the
dry land the name of earth, without however calling the earth dry. It is because dryness is
not one of those qualities which the earth acquired afterwards, but one of those which constituted
its essence from the beginning. Now that which causes a body to exist, is naturally
antecedent to its posterior qualities and has a pre-eminence over them. It is then with
reason that God chose the most ancient characteristic of the earth whereby to designate it.</p>
<p>6. “And God saw that it was good.”1534 Scripture does not merely wish to say that a
pleasing aspect of the sea presented itself to God. It is not with eyes that the Creator views
the beauty of His works. He contemplates them in His ineffable wisdom. A fair sight is the
sea all bright in a settled calm; fair too, when, ruffled by a light breeze of wind, its surface
shows tints of purple and azure,—when, instead of lashing with violence the neighbouring
shores, it seems to kiss them with peaceful caresses. However, it is not in this that Scripture
makes God find the goodness and charm of the sea. Here it is the purpose of the work which
makes the goodness.</p>
<p>In the first place sea water is the source of all the moisture of the earth. It filters through
imperceptible conduits, as is proved by the subterranean openings and caves whither its
waves penetrate; it is received in oblique and sinuous canals; then, driven out by the wind,
it rises to the surface of the earth, and breaks it, having become drinkable and free from its
bitterness by this long percolation. Often, moved by the same cause, it springs even from

mines that it has crossed, deriving warmth from them, and rises boiling, and bursts forth
of a burning heat, as may be seen in islands and on the sea coast; even inland in certain
places, in the neighbourhood of rivers, to compare little things with great, almost the same
phenomena occur. To what do these words tend? To prove that the earth is all undermined
with invisible conduits, where the water travels everywhere underground from the sources
of the sea.</p>
<p>7. Thus, in the eyes of God, the sea is good, because it makes the under current of
moisture in the depths of the earth. It is good again, because from all sides it receives the
rivers without exceeding its limits. It is good, because it is the origin and source of the waters
in the air. Warmed by the rays of the sun, it escapes in vapour, is attracted into the high
regions of the air, and is there cooled on account of its rising high above the refraction of
the rays from the ground, and, the shade of the clouds adding to this refrigeration, it is
changed into rain and fattens the earth. If people are incredulous, let them look at caldrons
on the fire, which, though full of water, are often left empty because all the water is boiled
and resolved into vapour. Sailors, too, boil even sea water, collecting the vapour in sponges,
to quench their thirst in pressing need.</p>
<p>Finally the sea is good in the eyes of God, because it girdles the isles, of which it forms
at the same time the rampart and the beauty, because it brings together the most distant
parts of the earth, and facilitates the inter-communication of mariners. By this means it
gives us the boon of general information, supplies the merchant with his wealth, and easily
provides for the necessities of life, allowing the rich to export their superfluities, and blessing
the poor with the supply of what they lack.</p>
<p>But whence do I perceive the goodness of the Ocean, as it appeared in the eyes of the
Creator? If the Ocean is good and worthy of praise before God, how much more beautiful
is the assembly of a Church like this, where the voices of men, of children, and of women,
arise in our prayers to God mingling and resounding like the waves which beat upon the
shore. This Church also enjoys a profound calm, and malicious spirits cannot trouble it
with the breath of heresy. Deserve, then, the approbation of the Lord by remaining faithful
to such good guidance, in our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and power for ever and
ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily V.</head>
<head>The Germination of the Earth.</head>
<p>1. “And God said Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree
yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself.”1535 It was deep wisdom that commanded
the earth, when it rested after discharging the weight of the waters, first to bring forth grass,
then wood as we see it doing still at this time. For the voice that was then heard and this
command were as a natural and permanent law for it; it gave fertility and the power to
produce fruit for all ages to come; “Let the earth bring forth.” The production of vegetables
shows first germination. When the germs begin to sprout they form grass; this develops
and becomes a plant, which insensibly receives its different articulations, and reaches its
maturity in the seed. Thus all things which sprout and are green are developed. “Let the
earth bring forth green grass.” Let the earth bring forth by itself without having any need
of help from without. Some consider the sun as the source of all productiveness on the
earth. It is, they say, the action of the sun’s heat which attracts the vital force from the centre
of the earth to the surface. The reason why the adornment of the earth was before the sun
is the following; that those who worship the sun, as the source of life, may renounce their
error. If they be well persuaded that the earth was adorned before the genesis of the sun,
they will retract their unbounded admiration for it, because they see grass and plants vegetate
before it rose.1536 If then the food for the flocks was prepared, did our race appear less
worthy of a like solicitude? He, who provided pasture for horses and cattle, thought before
all of your riches and pleasures. If he fed your cattle, it was to provide for all the needs of
your life. And what object was there in the bringing forth of grain, if not for your subsistence?
Moreover, many grasses and vegetables serve for the food of man.</p>
<p>2. “Let the earth bring forth grass yielding seed after his kind.” So that although some
kind of grass is of service to animals, even their gain is our gain too, and seeds are especially
designed for our use. Such is the true meaning of the words that I have quoted. “Let the
earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed after his kind.” In this manner we can re-establish
the order of the words, of which the construction seems faulty in the actual version,
and the economy of nature will be rigorously observed. In fact, first comes germination,
then verdure, then the growth of the plant, which after having attained its full growth arrives
at perfection in seed.</p>

<p>How then, they say, can Scripture describe all the plants of the earth as seed-bearing,
when the reed, couch-grass,1537 mint, crocus, garlic, and the flowering rush and countless
other species, produce no seed? To this we reply that many vegetables have their seminal
virtue in the lower part and in the roots. The need, for example, after its annual growth
sends forth a protuberance from its roots, which takes the place of seed for future trees.
Numbers of other vegetables are the same and all over the earth reproduce by the roots.
Nothing then is truer than that each plant produces its seed or contains some seminal virtue;
this is what is meant by “after its kind.” So that the shoot of a reed does not produce an
olive tree, but from a reed grows another reed, and from one sort of seed a plant of the same
sort always germinates. Thus, all which sprang from the earth, in its first bringing forth, is
kept the same to our time, thanks to the constant reproduction of kind.1538</p>
<p>“Let the earth bring forth.” See how, at this short word, at this brief command, the cold
and sterile earth travailed and hastened to bring forth its fruit, as it cast away its sad and
dismal covering to clothe itself in a more brilliant robe, proud of its proper adornment and
displaying the infinite variety of plants.</p>
<p>I want creation to penetrate you with so much admiration that everywhere, wherever
you may be, the least plant may bring to you the clear remembrance of the Creator. If you
see the grass of the fields, think of human nature, and remember the comparison of the wise
Isaiah. “All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.” Truly
the rapid flow of life, the short gratification and pleasure that an instant of happiness gives
a man, all wonderfully suit the comparison of the prophet. To-day he is vigorous in body,
fattened by luxury, and in the prime of life, with complexion fair like the flowers, strong
and powerful and of irresistible energy; tomorrow and he will be an object of pity, withered
by age or exhausted by sickness. Another shines in all the splendour of a brilliant fortune,
and around him are a multitude of flatterers, an escort of false friends on the track of his
good graces; a crowd of kinsfolk, but of no true kin; a swarm of servants who crowd after
him to provide for his food and for all his needs; and in his comings and goings this innumerable
suite, which he drags after him, excites the envy of all whom he meets. To fortune
may be added power in the State, honours bestowed by the imperial throne, the government
of a province, or the command of armies; a herald who precedes him is crying in a loud
voice; lictors right and left also fill his subjects with awe, blows, confiscations, banishments,
imprisonments, and all the means by which he strikes intolerable terror into all whom he
has to rule. And what then? One night, a fever, a pleurisy, or an inflammation of the lungs,
snatches away this man from the midst of men, stripped in a moment of all his stage accessor-

ies, and all this, his glory, is proved a mere dream. Therefore the Prophet has compared
human glory to the weakest flower.</p>
<p>3. Up to this point, the order in which plants shoot bears witness to their first arrangement.
Every herb, every plant proceeds from a germ. If, like the couch-grass and the crocus,
it throws out a shoot from its root and from this lower protuberance, it must always germinate
and start outwards. If it proceeds from a seed, there is still, by necessity, first a germ, then
the sprout, then green foliage, and finally the fruit which ripens upon a stalk hitherto dry
and thick. “Let the earth bring forth grass.” When the seed falls into the earth, which contains
the right combination of heat and moisture, it swells and becomes porous, and,
grasping the surrounding earth, attracts to itself all that is suitable for it and that has affinity
to it. These particles of earth, however small they may be, as they fall and insinuate themselves
into all the pores of the seed, broaden its bulk and make it send forth roots below,
and shoot upwards, sending forth stalks no less numerous than the roots. As the germ is
always growing warm, the moisture, pumped up through the roots, and helped by the attraction
of heat, draws a proper amount of nourishment from the soil, and distributes it to the
stem, to the bark, to the husk, to the seed itself and to the beards with which it is armed. It
is owing to these successive accretions that each plant attains its natural development, as
well corn as vegetables, herbs or brushwood. A single plant, a blade of grass is sufficient to
occupy all your intelligence in the contemplation of the skill which produced it.1539 Why
is the wheat stalk better with joints?1540 Are they not like fastenings, which help it to bear
easily the weight of the ear, when it is swollen with fruit and bends towards the earth? Thus,
whilst oats, which have no weight to bear at the top, are without these supports, nature has
provided them for wheat. It has hidden the grain in a case, so that it may not be exposed
to birds’ pillage, and has furnished it with a rampart of barbs, which, like darts, protect it
against the attacks of tiny creatures.</p>
<p>4. What shall I say? What shall I leave unsaid? In the rich treasures of creation it is
difficult to select what is most precious; the loss of what is omitted is too severe. “Let the
earth bring forth grass;” and instantly, with useful plants, appear noxious plants; with corn,
hemlock; with the other nutritious plants, hellebore, monkshood, mandrake and the juice
of the poppy. What then? Shall we show no gratitude for so many beneficial gifts, and reproach
the Creator for those which may be harmful to our life? And shall we not reflect
that all has not been created in view of the wants of our bellies? The nourishing plants,
which are destined for our use, are close at hand, and known by all the world. But in creation

nothing exists without a reason. The blood of the bull is a poison:1541 ought this animal
then, whose strength is so serviceable to man, not to have been created, or, if created, to
have been bloodless? But you have sense enough in yourself to keep you free from deadly
things. What! Sheep and goats know how to turn away from what threatens their life, discerning
danger by instinct alone: and you, who have reason and the art of medicine to
supply what you need, and the experience of your forebears to tell you to avoid all that is
dangerous, you tell me that you find it difficult to keep yourself from poisons! But not a
single thing has been created without reason, not a single thing is useless. One serves as
food to some animal; medicine has found in another a relief for one of our maladies. Thus
the starling eats hemlock, its constitution rendering it insusceptible to the action of the
poison. Thanks to the tenuity of the pores of its heart, the malignant juice is no sooner
swallowed than it is digested, before its chill can attack the vital parts.1542 The quail, thanks
to its peculiar temperament, whereby it escapes the dangerous effects, feeds on hellebore.
There are even circumstances where poisons are useful to men; with mandrake1543 doctors
give us sleep; with opium they lull violent pain. Hemlock has ere now been used to appease
the rage of unruly diseases;1544 and many times hellebore has taken away long standing
disease.1545 These plants, then, instead of making you accuse the Creator, give you a new
subject for gratitude.</p>
<p>5. “Let the earth bring forth grass.” What spontaneous provision is included in these
words,—that which is present in the root, in the plant itself, and in the fruit, as well as that
which our labour and husbandry add! God did not command the earth immediately to give
forth seed and fruit, but to produce germs, to grow green, and to arrive at maturity in the
seed; so that this first command teaches nature what she has to do in the course of ages.
But, they ask, is it true that the earth produces seed after his kind, when often, after having
sown wheat, we gather black grain? This is not a change of kind, but an alteration, a disease
of the grain. It has not ceased to be wheat; it is on account of having been burnt that it is

black, as one can learn from its name.1546 If a severe frost had burnt it,1547 it would have
had another colour and a different flavour. They even pretend that, if it could find suitable
earth and moderate temperature, it might return to its first form. Thus, you find nothing
in nature contrary to the divine command. As to the darnel and all those bastard grains
which mix themselves with the harvest, the tares of Scripture, far from being a variety of
corn, have their own origin and their own kind; image of those who alter the doctrine of
the Lord and, not being rightly instructed in the word, but, corrupted by the teaching of the
evil one, mix themselves with the sound body of the Church to spread their pernicious errors
secretly among purer souls. The Lord thus compares the perfection of those who believe
in Him to the growth of seed, “as if a man should cast seed into the ground; and should
sleep and rise, night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.
For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full
corn in the ear.”1548 “Let the earth bring forth grass.” In a moment earth began by germination
to obey the laws of the Creator, completed every stage of growth, and brought germs
to perfection. The meadows were covered with deep grass, the fertile plains quivered1549
with harvests, and the movement of the corn was like the waving of the sea. Every plant,
every herb, the smallest shrub, the least vegetable, arose from the earth in all its luxuriance.
There was no failure in this first vegetation: no husbandman’s inexperience, no inclemency
of the weather, nothing could injure it; then the sentence of condemnation was not fettering
the earth’s fertility. All this was before the sin which condemned us to eat our bread by the
sweat of our brow.</p>
<p>6. “Let the earth,” the Creator adds, “bring forth the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind,
whose seed is in itself.”1550</p>
<p>At this command every copse was thickly planted; all the trees, fir, cedar, cypress, pine,
rose to their greatest height, the shrubs were straightway clothed with thick foliage.1551 The
plants called crown-plants, roses, myrtles, laurels, did not exist; in one moment they came
into being, each one with its distinctive peculiarities. Most marked differences separated
them from other plants, and each one was distinguished by a character of its own. But then

the rose was without thorns; since then the thorn has been added to its beauty, to make us
feel that sorrow is very near to pleasure, and to remind us of our sin, which condemned the
earth to produce thorns1552 and caltrops. But, they say, the earth has received the command
to produce trees “yielding fruit whose seed was in itself,” and we see many trees which have
neither fruit, nor seed. What shall we reply? First, that only the more important trees are
mentioned; and then, that a careful examination will show us that every tree has seed, or
some property which takes the place of it. The black poplar, the willow, the elm, the white
poplar, all the trees of this family, do not produce any apparent fruit; however, an attentive
observer finds seed in each of them. This grain which is at the base of the leaf, and which
those who busy themselves with inventing words call mischos, has the property of seed.
And there are trees which reproduce by their branches, throwing out roots from them.
Perhaps we ought even to consider as seeds the saplings which spring from the roots of a
tree: for cultivators tear them out to multiply the species. But, we have already said, it is
chiefly a question of the trees which contribute most to our life; which offer their various
fruits to man and provide him with plentiful nourishment. Such is the vine, which produces
wine to make glad the heart of man; such is the olive tree, whose fruit brightens his face
with oil. How many things in nature are combined in the same plant! In a vine, roots, green
and flexible branches, which spread themselves far over the earth, buds, tendrils, bunches
of sour grapes and ripe grapes. The sight of a vine, when observed by an intelligent eye,
serves to remind you of your nature. Without doubt you remember the parable where the
Lord calls Himself a vine and His Father the husbandman, and every one of us who are
grafted by faith into the Church the branches. He invites us to produce fruits in abundance,
for fear lest our sterility should condemn us to the fire.1553 He constantly compares our
souls to vines. “My well beloved,” says He, “hath a vineyard in a very fruitfull hill,”1554 and
elsewhere, I have “planted a vineyard and hedged it round about.”1555 Evidently He calls
human souls His vine, those souls whom He has surrounded with the authority of His precepts
and a guard of angels. “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear
him.”1556 And further: He has planted for us, so to say, props, in establishing in His Church
apostles, prophets, teachers;1557 and raising our thoughts by the example of the blessed in
olden times, He has not allowed them to drag on the earth and be crushed under foot. He

wishes that the claspings of love, like the tendrils of the vine, should attach us to our neighbours
and make us rest on them, so that, in our continual aspirations towards heaven, we
may imitate these vines, which raise themselves to the tops of the tallest trees. He also asks
us to allow ourselves to be dug about; and that is what the soul does when it disembarrasses
itself from the cares of the world, which are a weight on our hearts. He, then, who is freed
from carnal affections and from the love of riches, and, far from being dazzled by them,
disdains and despises this miserable vain glory, is, so to say, dug about and at length breathes,
free from the useless weight of earthly thoughts. Nor must we, in the spirit of the parable,
put forth too much wood, that is to say, live with ostentation, and gain the applause of the
world; we must bring forth fruits, keeping the proof of our works for the husbandman. Be
“like a green olive tree in the house of God,”1558 never destitute of hope, but decked through
faith with the bloom of salvation. Thus you will resemble the eternal verdure of this plant
and will rival it in fruitfulness, if each day sees you giving abundantly in alms.</p>
<p>7. But let us return to the examination of the ingenious contrivances of creation. How
many trees then arose, some to give us their fruits, others to roof our houses, others to build
our ships, others to feed our fires! What a variety in the disposition of their several parts!
And yet, how difficult is it to find the distinctive property of each of them, and to grasp the
difference which separates them from other species. Some strike deep roots, others do not;
some shoot straight up and have only one stem, others appear to love the earth and, from
their root upwards, divide into several shoots. Those whose long branches stretch up afar
into the air, have also deep roots which spread within a large circumference, a true foundation
placed by nature to support the weight of the tree. What variety there is in bark! Some
plants have smooth bark, others rough, some have only one layer, others several. What a
marvellous thing! You may find in the youth and age of plants resemblances to those of
man. Young and vigorous, their bark is distended; when they grow old, it is rough and
wrinkled. Cut one, it sends forth new buds; the other remains henceforward sterile and as
if struck with a mortal wound. But further, it has been observed that pines, cut down, or
even submitted to the action of fire, are changed into a forest of oaks.1559 We know besides
<note type="footnote">1558 Ps. lii. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">1559 The phenomenon has been observed in later days, though Basil may be at fault in his account of the
cause. When pines have been cleared away in North American forests young oaklings have sprung up. The
acorn lay long hid, unable to contend against the pine, but, when once the ground was clear, it sprouted. This
upgrowth of a new kind of tree had been accounted for partly by the burial of germs by jays, rooks, and some
quadrupeds; partly by the theory of De Candolle and Liebig that roots expel certain substances which, though
unfavourable to the vitality of the plant excreting them, are capable of supporting others. So, on the pine pressure
being removed, the hidden seeds sprout in a kind of vegetable manure. cf. Sir Charles Lvell’s Travels in the
United States and Rough’s Elements of Forestry, p. 19.</note>

that the industry of agriculturists remedies the natural defects of certain trees. Thus the
sharp pomegranate and bitter almonds, if the trunk of the tree is pierced near the root to
introduce into the middle of the pith a fat plug of pine, lose the acidity of their juice, and
become delicious fruits.1560 Let not the sinner then despair of himself, when he thinks, if
agriculture can change the juices of plants, the efforts of the soul to arrive at virtue, can
certainly triumph over all infirmities.</p>
<p>Now there is such a variety of fruits in fruit trees that it is beyond all expression; a variety
not only in the fruits of trees of different families, but even in those of the same species, if
it be true, as gardeners say, that the sex of a tree influences the character of its fruits. They
distinguish male from female in palms; sometimes we see those which they call female lower
their branches, as though with passionate desire, and invite the embraces of the male. Then,
those who take care of these plants shake over these palms the fertilizing dust from the male
palm-tree, the psen as they call it: the tree appears to share the pleasures of enjoyment; then
it raises its branches, and its foliage resumes its usual form. The same is said of the fig tree.
Some plant wild fig trees near cultivated fig trees, and there are others who, to remedy the
weakness of the productive fig tree of our gardens, attach to the branches unripe figs and
so retain the fruit which had already begun to drop and to be lost. What lesson does nature
here give us? That we must often borrow, even from those who are strangers to the faith,
a certain vigour to show forth good works. If you see outside the Church, in pagan life, or
in the midst of a pernicious heresy, the example of virtue and fidelity to moral laws, redouble
your efforts to resemble the productive fig tree, who by the side of the wild fig tree, gains
strength, prevents the fruit from being shed, and nourishes it with more care.</p>
<p>8. Plants reproduce themselves in so many different ways, that we can only touch upon
the chief among them. As to fruits themselves, who could review their varieties, their forms,
their colours, the peculiar flavour, and the use of each of them? Why do some fruits ripen
when exposed bare to the rays of the sun, while others fill out while encased in shells? Trees
of which the fruit is tender have, like the fig tree, a thick shade of leaves; those, on the contrary,
of which the fruits are stouter, like the nut, are only covered by a light shade. The
delicacy of the first requires more care; if the latter had a thicker case, the shade of the leaves
would be harmful. Why is the vine leaf serrated, if not that the bunches of grapes may at
the same time resist the injuries of the air and receive through the openings all the rays of
the sun? Nothing has been done without motive, nothing by chance. All shows ineffable
wisdom.1561</p>

<p>What discourse can touch all? Can the human mind make an exact review, remark
every distinctive property, exhibit all the differences, unveil with certainty so many mysterious
causes? The same water, pumped up through the root, nourishes in a different way
the root itself, the bark of the trunk, the wood and the pith. It becomes leaf, it distributes
itself among the branches and twigs and makes the fruits swell—it gives to the plant its gum
and its sap. Who will explain to us the difference between all these? There is a difference
between the gum of the mastich and the juice of the balsam, a difference between that which
distils in Egypt and Libya from the fennel. Amber is, they say, the crystallized sap of plants.
And for a proof, see the bits of straws and little insects which have been caught in the sap
while still liquid and imprisoned there. In one word, no one without long experience could
find terms to express the virtue of it. How, again, does this water become wine in the vine,
and oil in the olive tree? Yet what is marvellous is, not to see it become sweet in one fruit,
fat and unctuous in another, but to see in sweet fruits an inexpressible variety of flavour.
There is one sweetness of the grape, another of the apple, another of the fig, another of the
date. I shall willingly give you the gratification of continuing this research. How is it that
this same water has sometimes a sweet taste, softened by its remaining in certain plants, and
at other times stings the palate because it has become acid by passing through others? How
is it, again, that it attains extreme bitterness, and makes the mouth rough when it is found
in wormwood and in scammony? That it has in acorns and dogwood a sharp and rough
flavour? That in the turpentine tree and the walnut tree it is changed into a soft and oily

flavours, as bitter in the sap as it is sweet in the fruit? And in the vine, is it not as

how in a meadow this same water becomes red in one flower, purple in another, blue in this
one, white in that. And this diversity of colours, is it to be compared to that of scents? But

some to nourish animals with their fruits and their leaves; some to provide medicinal help
by giving us their sap, their juice, their chips, their bark or their fruit. In a word, the experience
of ages, profiting from every chance, has not been able to discover anything useful,
which the penetrating foresight of the Creator did not first perceive and call into existence.
Therefore, when you see the trees in our gardens, or those of the forest, those which love
the water or the land, those which bear flowers, or those which do not flower, I should like
to see you recognising grandeur even in small objects, adding incessantly to your admiration
of, and redoubling your love for the Creator. Ask yourself why He has made some trees
evergreen and others deciduous; why, among the first, some lose their leaves, and others
always keep them. Thus the olive and the pine shed their leaves, although they renew them
insensibly and never appear to be despoiled of their verdure. The palm tree, on the contrary,
from its birth to its death, is always adorned with the same foliage. Think again of the double
life of the tamarisk; it is an aquatic plant, and yet it covers the desert. Thus, Jeremiah compares
it to the worst of characters—the double character.1562</p>
<p>10. “Let the earth bring forth.” This short command was in a moment a vast nature, an
elaborate system. Swifter than thought it produced the countless qualities of plants. It is
this command which, still at this day, is imposed on the earth, and in the course of each
year displays all the strength of its power to produce herbs, seeds and trees. Like tops, which
after the first impulse, continue their evolutions, turning upon themselves when once fixed
in their centre; thus nature, receiving the impulse of this first command, follows without
interruption the course of ages, until the consummation of all things.1563 Let us all hasten
to attain to it, full of fruit and of good works; and thus, planted in the house of the Lord we
shall flourish in the court of our God,1564 in our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and
power for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

the laws of the show indicate, for they prescribe that all should have the head uncovered
when present at the stadium. The object of this, in my opinion, is that each one there should
not only be a spectator of the athletes, but be, in a certain measure, a true athlete himself.1565
Thus, to investigate the great and prodigious show of creation, to understand supreme and
ineffable wisdom, you must bring personal light for the contemplation of the wonders which
I spread before your eyes, and help me, according to your power, in this struggle, where you
are not so much judges as fellow combatants,1566 for fear lest the truth might escape you,
and lest my error might turn to your common prejudice. Why these words? It is because
we propose to study the world as a whole, and to consider the universe, not by the light of
worldly wisdom, but by that with which God wills to enlighten His servant, when He speaks
to him in person and without enigmas. It is because it is absolutely necessary that all lovers
of great and grand shows should bring a mind well prepared to study them. If sometimes,
on a bright night,1567 whilst gazing with watchful eyes on the inexpressible beauty of the
stars, you have thought of the Creator of all things; if you have asked yourself who it is that
has dotted heaven with such flowers, and why visible things are even more useful than
beautiful; if sometimes, in the day, you have studied the marvels of light, if you have raised
yourself by visible things to the invisible Being, then you are a well prepared auditor, and
you can take your place in this august and blessed amphitheatre. Come in the same way
that any one not knowing a town is taken by the hand and led through it; thus I am going

will know that you are formed of earth, but the work of God’s hands; much weaker than the

is the beauty of visible things, what shall we think of invisible things? If the grandeur of
heaven exceeds the measure of human intelligence, what mind shall be able to trace the
nature of the everlasting? If the sun, subject to corruption, is so beautiful, so grand, so
rapid in its movement, so invariable in its course; if its grandeur is in such perfect harmony
with and due proportion to the universe: if, by the beauty of its nature, it shines like a brilliant
eye in the middle of creation; if finally, one cannot tire of contemplating it, what will be the
beauty of the Sun of Righteousness?1570 If the blind man suffers from not seeing the material

the earth, and to divide the day from the night.”1571 Heaven and earth were the first; after
them was created light; the day had been distinguished from the night, then had appeared
the firmament and the dry element. The water had been gathered into the reservoir assigned
to it, the earth displayed its productions, it had caused many kinds of herbs to germinate
and it was adorned with all kinds of plants. However, the sun and the moon did not yet
exist, in order that those who live in ignorance of God may not consider the sun as the origin
and the father of light, or as the maker of all that grows out of the earth.1572 That is why

there was a fourth day, and then God said: “Let there be lights in the firmament of the
heaven.”</p>
<p>When once you have learnt Who spoke, think immediately of the hearer. God said,
“Let there be lights<gap reason="omitted"/>and God made two great lights.” Who spoke? and Who made? Do
you not see a double person? Everywhere, in mystic language, history is sown with the
dogmas of theology.</p>
<p>The motive follows which caused the lights to be created. It was to illuminate the earth.
Already light was created; why therefore say that the sun was created to give light? And,
first, do not laugh at the strangeness of this expression. We do not follow your nicety about
words, and we trouble ourselves but little to give them a harmonious turn. Our writers do
not amuse themselves by polishing their periods, and everywhere we prefer clearness of
words to sonorous expressions. See then if by this expression “to light up,” the sacred writer
sufficiently made his thought understood. He has put “to give light”1573 instead of “illumination.”
1574 Now there is nothing here contradictory to what has been said of light. Then
the actual nature of light was produced: now the sun’s body is constructed to be a vehicle
for that original light. A lamp is not fire. Fire has the property of illuminating, and we have
invented the lamp to light us in darkness. In the same way, the luminous bodies have been
fashioned as a vehicle for that pure, clear, and immaterial light. The Apostle speaks to us
of certain lights which shine in the world1575 without being confounded with the true light
of the world, the possession of which made the saints luminaries of the souls which they
instructed and drew from the darkness of ignorance. This is why the Creator of all things,
made the sun in addition to that glorious light, and placed it shining in the heavens.</p>
<p>3. And let no one suppose it to be a thing incredible that the brightness of the light is
one thing, and the body which is its material vehicle is another. First, in all composite things,
we distinguish substance susceptible of quality, and the quality which it receives. The nature
of whiteness is one thing, another is that of the body which is whitened; thus the natures
differ which we have just seen reunited by the power of the Creator. And do not tell me
that it is impossible to separate them. Even I do not pretend to be able to separate light
from the body of the sun; but I maintain that that which we separate in thought, may be
separated in reality by the Creator of nature. You cannot, moreover, separate the brightness
of fire from the virtue of burning which it possesses; but God, who wished to attract His
servant by a wonderful sight, set a fire in the burning bush, which displayed all the brilliancy

of flame while its devouring property was dormant. It is that which the Psalmist affirms in
saying “The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire.”1576 Thus, in the requital which
awaits us after this life, a mysterious voice seems to tell us that the double nature of fire will
be divided; the just will enjoy its light, and the torment of its heat will be the torture of the
wicked.</p>
<p>In the revolutions of the moon we find anew proof of what we have advanced. When
it stops and grows less it does not consume itself in all its body, but in the measure that it
deposits or absorbs the light which surrounds it, it presents to us the image of its decrease
or of its increase. If we wish an evident proof that the moon does not consume its body
when at rest, we have only to open our eyes. If you look at it in a cloudless and clear sky,
you observe, when it has taken the complete form of a crescent, that the part, which is dark
and not lighted up, describes a circle equal to that which the full moon forms. Thus the eye
can take in the whole circle, if it adds to the illuminated part this obscure and dark curve.
And do not tell me that the light of the moon is borrowed, diminishing or increasing in
proportion as it approaches or recedes from the sun. That is not now the object of our research;
we only wish to prove that its body differs from the light which makes it shine. I
wish you to have the same idea of the sun; except however that the one, after having once
received light and having mixed it with its substance, does not lay it down again, whilst the
other, turn by turn, putting off and reclothing itself again with light, proves by that which
takes place in itself what we have said of the sun.</p>
<p>The sun and moon thus received the command to divide the day from the night. God
had already separated light from darkness; then He placed their natures in opposition, so
that they could not mingle, and that there could never be anything in common between
darkness and light. You see what a shadow is during the day; that is precisely the nature of
darkness during the night. If, at the appearance of a light, the shadow always falls on the
opposite side; if in the morning it extends towards the setting sun; if in the evening it inclines
towards the rising sun, and at mid-day turns towards the north; night retires into the regions
opposed to the rays of the sun, since it is by nature only the shadow of the earth. Because,
in the same way that, during the day, shadow is produced by a body which intercepts the
light, night comes naturally when the air which surrounds the earth is in shadow. And this
is precisely what Scripture says, “God divided the light from the darkness.” Thus darkness
fled at the approach of light, the two being at their first creation divided by a natural antipathy.
Now God commanded the sun to measure the day, and the moon, whenever she
rounds her disc, to rule the night. For then these two luminaries are almost diametrically
<note type="footnote">1576 Ps. xxix. 7.</note>

<pb n="312"/>
opposed; when the sun rises, the full moon disappears from the horizon, to re-appear in the
east at the moment the sun sets. It matters little to our subject if in other phases the light
of the moon does not correspond exactly with night. It is none the less true, that when at
its perfection it makes the stars to turn pale and lightens up the earth with the splendour of
its light, it reigns over the night, and in concert with the sun divides the duration of it in
equal parts.</p>
<p>4. “And let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years.”1577 The signs
which the luminaries give are necessary to human life. In fact what useful observations will
long experience make us discover, if we ask without undue curiosity! What signs of rain,
of drought, or of the rising of the wind, partial or general, violent or moderate! Our Lord
indicates to us one of the signs given by the sun when He says, “It will be foul weather today;
for the sky is red and lowering.”1578 In fact, when the sun rises through a fog, its rays
are darkened, but the disc appears burning like a coal and of a bloody red colour. It is the
thickness of the air which causes this appearance; as the rays of the sun do not disperse such
amassed and condensed air, it cannot certainly be retained by the waves of vapour which
exhale from the earth, and it will cause from superabundance of moisture a storm in the
countries over which it accumulates. In the same way, when the moon is surrounded with
moisture, or when the sun is encircled with what is called a halo, it is the sign of heavy rain
or of a violent storm; again, in the same way, if mock suns accompany the sun in its course
they foretell certain celestial phenomena. Finally, those straight lines, like the colours of
the rainbow, which are seen on the clouds, announce rain, extraordinary tempests, or, in
one word, a complete change in the weather.</p>
<p>Those who devote themselves to the observation of these bodies find signs in the different
phases of the moon, as if the air, by which the earth is enveloped, were obliged to vary to
correspond with its change of form. Towards the third day of the new moon, if it is sharp
and clear, it is a sign of fixed fine weather. If its horns appear thick and reddish it threatens
us either with heavy rain or with a gale from the South.1579 Who does not know how useful1580
are these signs in life? Thanks to them, the sailor keeps back his vessel in the harbour,
foreseeing the perils with which the winds threaten him, and the traveller beforehand takes
shelter from harm, waiting until the weather has become fairer. Thanks to them, husbandmen,
busy with sowing seed or cultivating plants, are able to know which seasons are favour-

able to their labours. Further, the Lord has announced to us that at the dissolution of the
universe, signs will appear in the sun, in the moon and in the stars. The sun shall be turned
into blood and the moon shall not give her light,1581 signs of the consummation of all things.</p>
<p>5. But those who overstep the borders,1582 making the words of Scripture their apology
for the art of casting nativities, pretend that our lives depend upon the motion of the heavenly
bodies, and that thus the Chaldæans read in the planets that which will happen to us.1583
By these very simple words “let them be for signs,” they understand neither the variations
of the weather, nor the change of seasons; they only see in them, at the will of their imagination,
the distribution of human destinies. What do they say in reality? When the planets
cross in the signs of the Zodiac, certain figures formed by their meeting give birth to certain
destinies, and others produce different destinies.</p>
<p>Perhaps for clearness sake it is not useless to enter into more detail about this vain science.
I will say nothing of my own to refute them; I will use their words, bringing a remedy
for the infected, and for others a preservative from falling. The inventors of astrology seeing
that in the extent of time many signs escaped them, divided it and enclosed each part in
narrow limits, as if in the least and shortest interval, in a moment, in the twinkling of an
eye,1584 to speak with the Apostle, the greatest difference should be found between one birth
and another. Such an one is born in this moment; he will be a prince over cities and will
govern the people, in the fulness of riches and power. Another is born the instant after; he
will be poor, miserable, and will wander daily from door to door begging his bread. Consequently
they divide the Zodiac into twelve parts, and, as the sun takes thirty days to traverse
each of the twelve divisions of this unerring circle, they divide them into thirty more. Each
of them forms sixty new ones, and these last are again divided into sixty. Let us see then if,

in determining the birth of an infant, it will be possible to observe this rigorous division of
time. The child is born. The nurse ascertains the sex; then she awaits the wail which is a
sign of its life. Until then how many moments have passed do you think? The nurse announces
the birth of the child to the Chaldæan: how many minutes would you count before
she opens her mouth, especially if he who records the hour is outside the women’s apartments?
And we know that he who consults the dial, ought, whether by day or by night, to
mark the hour with the most precise exactitude. What a swarm of seconds passes during
this time! For the planet of nativity ought to be found, not only in one of the twelve divisions
of the Zodiac, and even in one of its first subdivisions, but again in one of the sixtieth parts
which divide this last, and even, to arrive at the exact truth, in one of the sixtieth subdivisions
that this contains in its turn. And to obtain such minute knowledge, so impossible to grasp
from this moment, each planet must be questioned to find its position as regards the signs
of the Zodiac and the figures that the planets form at the moment of the child’s birth. Thus,
if it is impossible to find exactly the hour of birth, and if the least change can upset all, then
both those who give themselves up to this imaginary science and those who listen to them
open-mouthed, as if they could learn from them the future, are supremely ridiculous.</p>
<p>6. But what effects are produced? Such an one will have curly hair and bright eyes,
because he is born under the Ram; such is the appearance of a ram. He will have noble
feelings; because the Ram is born to command. He will be liberal and fertile in resources,
because this animal gets rid of its fleece without trouble, and nature immediately hastens
to reclothe it. Another is born under the Bull: he will be enured to hardship and of a slavish
character, because the bull bows under the yoke. Another is born under the Scorpion; like
to this venomous reptile he will be a striker. He who is born under the Balance will be just,
thanks to the justness of our balances. Is not this the height of folly? This Ram, from whence
you draw the nativity of man, is the twelfth part of the heaven, and in entering into it the
sun reaches the spring. The Balance and the Bull are likewise twelfth parts of the Zodiac.
How can you see there the principal causes which influence the life of man? And why do
you take animals to characterize the manners of men who enter this world? He who is born
under the Ram will be liberal, not because this part of heaven gives this characteristic, but
because such is the nature of the beast. Why then should we frighten ourselves by the names
of these stars and undertake to persuade ourselves with these bleatings? If heaven has different
characteristics derived from these animals, it is then itself subject to external influences
since its causes depend on the brutes who graze in our fields. A ridiculous assertion; but
how much more ridiculous the pretence of arriving at the influence on each other of things
which have not the least connexion! This pretended science is a true spider’s web; if a gnat

<pb n="315"/>
or a fly, or some insect equally feeble falls into it it is held entangled; if a stronger animal
approaches, it passes through without trouble, carrying the weak tissue away with it.1585</p>
<p>7. They do not, however, stop here; even our acts, where each one feels his will ruling,
I mean, the practice of virtue or of vice, depend, according to them, on the influence of celestial
bodies. It would be ridiculous seriously to refute such an error, but, as it holds a great
many in its nets, perhaps it is better not to pass it over in silence. I would first ask them if
the figures which the stars describe do not change a thousand times a day. In the perpetual
motion of planets, some meet in a more rapid course, others make slower revolutions, and
often in an hour we see them look at each other and then hide themselves. Now, at the hour
of birth, it is very important whether one is looked upon by a beneficent star or by an evil
one, to speak their language. Often then the astrologers do not seize the moment when a
good star shows itself, and, on account of having let this fugitive moment escape, they enrol
the newborn under the influence of a bad genius. I am compelled to use their own words.
What madness! But, above all, what impiety! For the evil stars throw the blame of their
wickedness upon Him Who made them. If evil is inherent in their nature, the Creator is
the author of evil. If they make it themselves, they are animals endowed with the power of
choice, whose acts will be free and voluntary. Is it not the height of folly to tell these lies
about beings without souls? Again, what a want of sense does it show to distribute good
and evil without regard to personal merit; to say that a star is beneficent because it occupies
a certain place; that it becomes evil, because it is viewed by another star; and that if it moves
ever so little from this figure it loses its malign influence.</p>
<p>But let us pass on. If, at every instant of duration, the stars vary their figures, then in
these thousand changes, many times a day, there ought to be reproduced the configuration
of royal births. Why then does not every day see the birth of a king? Why is there a succession
on the throne from father to son? Without doubt there has never been a king who has
taken measures to have his son born under the star of royalty. For what man possesses such
a power? How then did Uzziah beget Jotham, Jotham Ahaz, Ahaz Hezekiah? And by what
chance did the birth of none of them happen in an hour of slavery? If the origin of our virtues
and of our vices is not in ourselves, but is the fatal consequence of our birth, it is useless for
legislators to prescribe for us what we ought to do, and what we ought to avoid; it is useless
for judges to honour virtue and to punish vice. The guilt is not in the robber, not in the
assassin: it was willed for him; it was impossible for him to hold back his hand, urged to
evil by inevitable necessity. Those who laboriously cultivate the arts are the maddest of
men. The labourer will make an abundant harvest without sowing seed and without
sharpening his sickle. Whether he wishes it or not, the merchant will make his fortune, and

in yourselves have no need to hear more, and time does not allow us to make attacks without
limit against these unhappy men.</p>
<p>8. Let us return to the words which follow. “Let them be for signs and for seasons and
for days and years.”1586 We have spoken about signs. By times, we understand the succession
of seasons, winter, spring, summer and autumn, which we see follow each other in so regular
a course, thanks to the regularity of the movement of the luminaries. It is winter when the
sun sojourns in the south and produces in abundance the shades of night in our region.
The air spread over the earth is chilly, and the damp exhalations, which gather over our
heads, give rise to rains, to frosts, to innumerable flakes of snow. When, returning from
the southern regions, the sun is in the middle of the heavens and divides day and night into
equal parts, the more it sojourns above the earth the more it brings back a mild temperature
to us. Then comes spring, which makes all the plants germinate, and gives to the greater
part of the trees their new life, and, by successive generation, perpetuates all the land and
water animals. From thence the sun, returning to the summer solstice, in the direction of
the North, gives us the longest days. And, as it travels farther in the air, it burns that which
is over our heads, dries up the earth, ripens the grains and hastens the maturity of the fruits
of the trees. At the epoch of its greatest heat, the shadows which the sun makes at mid-day
are short, because it shines from above, from the air over our heads. Thus the longest days
are those when the shadows are shortest, in the same way that the shortest days are those
when the shadows are longest. It is this which happens to all of us “Hetero-skii”1587
(shadowed-on-one-side) who inhabit the northern regions of the earth. But there are people
who, two days in the year, are completely without shade at mid-day, because the sun, being
perpendicularly over their heads, lights them so equally from all sides, that it could through
a narrow opening shine at the bottom of a well. Thus there are some who call them “askii”
(shadowless). For those who live beyond the land of spices1588 see their shadow now on
one side, now on another, the only inhabitants of this land of which the shade falls at mid-

day; thus they are given the name of “amphiskii,”1589 (shadowed-on-both-sides ). All these
phenomena happen whilst the sun is passing into northern regions: they give us an idea of
the heat thrown on the air, by the rays of the sun and of the effects that they produce. Next
we pass to autumn, which breaks up the excessive heat, lessening the warmth little by little,
and by a moderate temperature brings us back without suffering to winter, to the time when
the sun returns from the northern regions to the southern. It is thus that seasons, following
the course of the sun, succeed each other to rule our life.</p>
<p>“Let them be for days”1590 says Scripture, not to produce them but to rule them; because
day and night are older than the creation of the luminaries and it is this that the psalm declares
to us. “The sun to rule by day<gap reason="omitted"/>the moon and stars to rule by night.”1591 How does
the sun rule by day? Because carrying everywhere light with it, it is no sooner risen above
the horizon than it drives away darkness and brings us day. Thus we might, without self
deception, define day as air lighted by the sun, or as the space of time that the sun passes in
our hemisphere. The functions of the sun and moon serve further to mark years. The moon,
after having twelve times run her course, forms a year which sometimes needs an intercalary
month to make it exactly agree with the seasons. Such was formerly the year of the Hebrews
and of the early Greeks.1592 As to the solar year, it is the time that the sun, having started
from a certain sign, takes to return to it in its normal progress.</p>
<p>9. “And God made two great lights.”1593 The word “great,” if, for example we say it of
the heaven of the earth or of the sea, may have an absolute sense; but ordinarily it has only
a relative meaning, as a great horse, or a great ox. It is not that these animals are of an immoderate
size, but that in comparison with their like they deserve the title of great. What
idea shall we ourselves form here of greatness? Shall it be the idea that we have of it in the
ant and in all the little creatures of nature, which we call great in comparison with those like
themselves, and to show their superiority over them? Or shall we predicate greatness of the
luminaries, as of the natural greatness inherent in them? As for me, I think so. If the sun
and moon are great, it is not in comparison with the smaller stars, but because they have
such a circumference that the splendour which they diffuse lights up the heavens and the

air, embracing at the same time earth and sea. In whatever part of heaven they may be,
whether rising, or setting, or in mid heaven, they appear always the same in the eyes of men,
a manifest proof of their prodigious size. For the whole extent of heaven cannot make them
appear greater in one place and smaller in another. Objects which we see afar off appear
dwarfed to our eyes, and in measure as they approach us we can form a juster idea of their
size. But there is no one who can be nearer or more distant from the sun. All the inhabitants
of the earth see it at the same distance. Indians and Britons see it of the same size. The
people of the East do not see it decrease in magnitude when it sets; those of the West do not
find it smaller when it rises. If it is in the middle of the heavens it does not vary in either
aspect. Do not be deceived by mere appearance, and because it looks a cubit’s breadth,
imagine it to be no bigger.1594 At a very great distance objects always lose size in our eyes;
sight, not being able to clear the intermediary space, is as it were exhausted in the middle
of its course, and only a small part of it reaches the visible object.1595 Our power of sight
is small and makes all we see seem small, affecting what it sees by its own condition. Thus,
then, if sight is mistaken its testimony is fallible. Recall your own impressions and you will
find in yourself the proof of my words. If you have ever from the top of a high mountain
looked at a large and level plain, how big did the yokes of oxen appear to you? How big
were the ploughmen themselves? Did they not look like ants?1596 If from the top of a
commanding rock, looking over the wide sea, you cast your eyes over the vast extent how
big did the greatest islands appear to you? How large did one of those barks of great tonnage,
which unfurl their white sails to the blue sea, appear to you. Did it not look smaller than a
dove? It is because sight, as I have just told you, loses itself in the air, becomes weak and

cannot seize with exactness the object which it sees. And further: your sight shows you
high mountains intersected by valleys as rounded and smooth, because it reaches only to
the salient parts, and is not able, on account of its weakness, to penetrate into the valleys
which separate them. It does not even preserve the form of objects, and thinks that all square
towers are round. Thus all proves that at a great distance sight only presents to us obscure
and confused objects. The luminary is then great, according to the witness of Scripture,
and infinitely greater than it appears.</p>
<p>10. See again another evident proof of its greatness. Although the heaven may be full
of stars without number, the light contributed by them all could not disperse the gloom of
night. The sun alone, from the time that it appeared on the horizon, while it was still expected
and had not yet risen completely above the earth, dispersed the darkness, outshone the stars,
dissolved and diffused the air, which was hitherto thick and condensed over our heads, and
produced thus the morning breeze and the dew which in fine weather streams over the
earth. Could the earth with such a wide extent be lighted up entirely in one moment if an
immense disc were not pouring forth its light over it? Recognise here the wisdom of the
Artificer. See how He made the heat of the sun proportionate to this distance. Its heat is
so regulated that it neither consumes the earth by excess, nor lets it grow cold and sterile
by defect.</p>
<p>To all this the properties of the moon are near akin; she, too, has an immense body,
whose splendour only yields to that of the sun. Our eyes, however, do not always see her
in her full size. Now she presents a perfectly rounded disc, now when diminished and
lessened she shows a deficiency on one side. When waxing she is shadowed on one side,
and when she is waning another side is hidden. Now it is not without a secret reason of the
divine Maker of the universe, that the moon appears from time to time under such different
forms. It presents a striking example of our nature. Nothing is stable in man; here from
nothingness he raises himself to perfection; there after having hasted to put forth his strength
to attain his full greatness he suddenly is subject to gradual deterioration, and is destroyed
by diminution. Thus, the sight of the moon, making us think of the rapid vicissitudes of
human things, ought to teach us not to pride ourselves on the good things of this life, and
not to glory in our power, not to be carried away by uncertain riches, to despise our flesh
which is subject to change, and to take care of the soul, for its good is unmoved. If you
cannot behold without sadness the moon losing its splendour by gradual and imperceptible
decrease, how much more distressed should you be at the sight of a soul, who, after having
possessed virtue, loses its beauty by neglect, and does not remain constant to its affections,
but is agitated and constantly changes because its purposes are unstable. What Scripture
says is very true, “As for a fool he changeth as the moon.”1597</p>
<note type="footnote">1597 Ecclus. xxvii. 11.</note>

<pb n="320"/>
<p>I believe also that the variations of the moon do not take place without exerting great
influence upon the organization of animals and of all living things. This is because bodies
are differently disposed at its waxing and waning. When she wanes they lose their density
and become void. When she waxes and is approaching her fulness they appear to fill
themselves at the same time with her, thanks to an imperceptible moisture that she emits
mixed with heat, which penetrates everywhere.1598 For proof, see how those who sleep
under the moon feel abundant moisture filling their heads;1599 see how fresh meat is quickly
turned under the action of the moon;1600 see the brain of animals, the moistest part of
marine animals, the pith of trees. Evidently the moon must be, as Scripture says, of
enormous size and power to make all nature thus participate in her changes.</p>
<p>11. On its variations depends also the condition of the air, as is proved by sudden dis
turbances which often come after the new moon, in the midst of a calm and of a stillness in
the winds, to agitate the clouds and to hurl them against each other; as the flux and reflux
in straits, and the ebb and flow of the ocean prove, so that those who live on its shores see
it regularly following the revolutions of the moon. The waters of straits approach and retreat
from one shore to the other during the different phases of the moon; but, when she is new,
they have not an instant of rest, and move in perpetual swaying to and fro, until the moon,
reappearing, regulates their reflux. As to the Western sea,1601 we see it in its ebb and flow

now return into its bed, and now overflow, as the moon draws it back by her respiration
and then, by her expiration, urges it to its own boundaries.1602</p>
<p>I have entered into these details, to show you the grandeur of the luminaries, and to
make you see that, in the inspired words, there is not one idle syllable. And yet my sermon
has scarcely touched on any important point; there are many other discoveries about the
size and distance of the sun and moon to which any one who will make a serious study of
their action and of their characteristics may arrive by the aid of reason. Let me then ingenuously
make an avowal of my weakness, for fear that you should measure the mighty works
of the Creator by my words. The little that I have said ought the rather to make you conjecture
the marvels on which I have omitted to dwell. We must not then measure the moon
with the eye, but with the reason. Reason, for the discovery of truth, is much surer than the
eye.</p>
<p>Everywhere ridiculous old women’s tales, imagined in the delirium of drunkenness,
have been circulated; such as that enchantments can remove the moon from its place and
make it descend to the earth. How could a magician’s charm shake that of which the Most
High has laid the foundations? And if once torn out what place could hold it?1603</p>
<p>Do you wish from slight indications to have a proof of the moon’s size? All the towns
in the world, however distant from each other, equally receive the light from the moon in
those streets that are turned towards its rising. If she did not look on all face to face, those
only would be entirely lighted up which were exactly opposite; as to those beyond the extremities
of her disc, they would only receive diverted and oblique rays. It is this effect
which the light of lamps produces in houses; if a lamp is surrounded by several persons,
only the shadow of the person who is directly opposite to it is cast in a straight line, the
others follow inclined lines on each side. In the same way, if the body of the moon were
not of an immense and prodigious size she could not extend herself alike to all. In reality,
when the moon rises in the equinoctial regions, all equally enjoy her light, both those who
inhabit the icy zone, under the revolutions of the Bear, and those who dwell in the extreme
south in the neighbourhood of the torrid zone. She gives us an idea of her size by appearing
to be face to face with all people. Who then can deny the immensity of a body which divides
itself equally over such a wide extent?</p>

<head>The creation of moving creatures.1605</head>
<p>1. “And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath
life” after their kind, “and fowl that may fly above the earth” after their kind.1606 After the
creation of the luminaries the waters are now filled with living beings and its own adornment
is given to this part of the world. Earth had received hers from her own plants, the heavens
had received the flowers of the stars, and, like two eyes, the great luminaries beautified them
in concert. It still remained for the waters to receive their adornment. The command was
given, and immediately the rivers and lakes becoming fruitful brought forth their natural
broods; the sea travailed with all kinds of swimming creatures; not even in mud and marshes
did the water remain idle; it took its part in creation. Everywhere from its ebullition frogs,
gnats and flies came forth. For that which we see to-day is the sign of the past. Thus
everywhere the water hastened to obey the Creator’s command. Who could count the species
which the great and ineffable power of God caused to be suddenly seen living and moving,
when this command had empowered the waters to bring forth life? Let the waters bring
forth moving creatures that have life. Then for the first time is made a being with life and
feeling. For though plants and trees be said to live, seeing that they share the power of being
nourished and growing; nevertheless they are neither living beings, nor have they life.1607
To create these last God said, “Let the water produce moving creatures.”</p>
<p>Every creature that swims, whether it skims on the surface of the waters, or cleaves the
depths, is of the nature of a moving creature,1608 since it drags itself on the body of the water.
Certain aquatic animals have feet and walk; especially amphibia, such as seals, crabs, crocodiles,
river horses1609 and frogs; but they are above all gifted with the power of swimming.
Thus it is said, Let the waters produce moving creatures. In these few words what species
is omitted? Which is not included in the command of the Creator? Do we not see viviparous
animals, seals, dolphins, rays and all cartilaginous animals? Do we not see oviparous animals
comprising every sort of fish, those which have a skin and those which have scales, those
which have fins and those which have not? This command has only required one word,
even less than a word, a sign, a motion of the divine will, and it has such a wide sense that
it includes all the varieties and all the families of fish. To review them all would be to under-

take to count the waves of the ocean or to measure its waters in the hollow of the hand.
“Let the waters produce moving creatures.” That is to say, those which people the high seas
and those which love the shores; those which inhabit the depths and those which attach
themselves to rocks; those which are gregarious and those which live dispersed, the cetaceous,
the huge, and the tiny. It is from the same power, the same command, that all, small and
great receive their existence. “Let the waters bring forth.” These words show you the natural
affinity of animals which swim in the water; thus, fish, when drawn out of the water, quickly
die, because they have no respiration such as could attract our air and water is their element,
as air is that of terrestrial animals. The reason for it is clear. With us the lung, that porous
and spongy portion of the inward parts which receives air by the dilatation of the chest,
disperses and cools interior warmth; in fish the motion of the gills, which open and shut by
turns to take in and to eject the water, takes the place of respiration.1610 Fish have a peculiar
lot, a special nature, a nourishment of their own, a life apart. Thus they cannot be tamed
and cannot bear the touch of a man’s hand.1611</p>
<p>2. “Let the waters bring forth moving creatures after their kind.” God caused to be
born the firstlings of each species to serve as seeds for nature. Their multitudinous numbers
are kept up in subsequent succession, when it is necessary for them to grow and multiply.
Of another kind is the species of testacea, as muscles, scallops, sea snails, conches, and the
infinite variety of oysters. Another kind is that of the crustacea, as crabs and lobsters; another
of fish without shells, with soft and tender flesh, like polypi and cuttle fish. And amidst
these last what an innumerable variety! There are weevers, lampreys and eels, produced in
the mud of rivers and ponds, which more resemble venomous reptiles than fish in their
nature. Of another kind is the species of the ovipara; of another, that of the vivipara. Among
the latter are sword-fish, cod, in one word, all cartilaginous fish, and even the greater part

of the cetacea, as dolphins, seals, which, it is said, if they see their little ones, still quite young,
frightened, take them back into their belly to protect them.1612</p>
<p>Let the waters bring forth after their kind. The species of the cetacean is one; another is
that of small fish. What infinite variety in the different kinds! All have their own names,
different food, different form, shape, and quality of flesh. All present infinite variety, and
are divided into innumerable classes. Is there a tunny fisher who can enumerate to us the
different varieties of that fish? And yet they tell us that at the sight of great swarms of fish
they can almost tell the number of the individual ones which compose it. What man is there
of all that have spent their long lives by coasts and shores, who can inform us with exactness
of the history of all fish?</p>
<p>Some are known to the fishermen of the Indian ocean, others to the toilers of the
Egyptian gulf, others to the islanders, others to the men of Mauretania.1613 Great and small
were all alike created by this first command, by this ineffable power. What a difference in
their food! What a variety in the manner in which each species reproduces itself! Most fish
do not hatch eggs like birds; they do not build nests; they do not feed their young with toil;
it is the water which receives and vivifies the egg dropped into it. With them the reproduction
of each species is invariable, and natures are not mixed. There are none of those unions
which, on the earth, produce mules and certain birds contrary to the nature of their species.
With fish there is no variety which, like the ox and the sheep, is armed with a half-equipment
of teeth, none which ruminates except, according to certain writers, the scar.1614 All have
serried and very sharp teeth, for fear their food should escape them if they masticate it for
too long a time. In fact, if it were not crushed and swallowed as soon as divided, it would
be carried away by the water.</p>
<p>3. The food of fish differs according to their species. Some feed on mud; others eat sea
weed; others content themselves with the herbs that grow in water. But the greater part
devour each other, and the smaller is food for the larger, and if one which has possessed itself
of a fish weaker than itself becomes a prey to another, the conqueror and the conquered are
both swallowed up in the belly of the last. And we mortals, do we act otherwise when we
press our inferiors?1615 What difference is there between the last fish and the man who,
impelled by devouring greed, swallows the weak in the folds of his insatiable avarice? Yon
fellow possessed the goods of the poor; you caught him and made him a part of your
abundance. You have shown yourself more unjust than the unjust, and more miserly than

when we have done the deeds of the wicked, shall not escape punishment at the last.</p>
<p>Now see what tricks, what cunning, are to be found in a weak animal, and learn not to
imitate wicked doers. The crab loves the flesh of the oyster; but, sheltered by its shell, a
solid rampart with which nature has furnished its soft and delicate flesh, it is a difficult prey
to seize. Thus they call the oyster “sherd-hide.”1616 Thanks to the two shells with which it
is enveloped, and which adapt themselves perfectly the one to the other, the claws of the
crab are quite powerless. What does he do? When he sees it, sheltered from the wind,
warming itself with pleasure, and half opening its shells to the sun,1617 he secretly throws
in a pebble, prevents them from closing, and takes by cunning what force had lost.1618 Such
is the malice of these animals, deprived as they are of reason and of speech. But I would
that you should at once rival the crab in cunning and industry, and abstain from harming
your neighbour; this animal is the image of him who craftily approaches his brother, takes
advantage of his neighbour’s misfortunes, and finds his delight in other men’s troubles. O
copy not the damned! Content yourself with your own lot. Poverty, with what is necessary,
is of more value in the eyes of the wise than all pleasures.</p>
<p>I will not pass in silence the cunning and trickery of the squid, which takes the colour
of the rock to which it attaches itself. Most fish swim idly up to the squid as they might to
a rock, and become themselves the prey of the crafty creature.1619 Such are men who court
ruling powers, bending themselves to all circumstances and not remaining for a moment
in the same purpose; who praise self-restraint in the company of the self-restrained, and license
in that of the licentious, accommodating their feelings to the pleasure of each. It is
difficult to escape them and to put ourselves on guard against their mischief; because it is
under the mask of friendship that they hide their clever wickedness. Men like this are
ravening wolves covered with sheep’s clothing, as the Lord calls them.1620 Flee then

the solitary in families.1622 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable,
both small and great beasts.1623 Yet a wise and marvellous order reigns among
these animals. Fish do not always deserve our reproaches; often they offer us useful examples.
How is it that each sort of fish, content with the region that has been assigned to it, never
travels over its own limits to pass into foreign seas? No surveyor has ever distributed to
them their habitations, nor enclosed them in walls, nor assigned limits to them; each kind
has been naturally assigned its own home. One gulf nourishes one kind of fish, another
other sorts; those which swarm here are absent elsewhere. No mountain raises its sharp
peaks between them; no rivers bar the passage to them; it is a law of nature, which according
to the needs of each kind, has allotted to them their dwelling places with equality and
justice.1624</p>

bodies artificially, as so many microcosms or little worlds, there must also be a general plastick Nature in the
macrocosm, the whole corporeal universe, that which makes all things thus to conspire everywhere, and agree
together into one harmony. Concerning which plastick nature of the universe, the Author De Mundo writes
after this manner, καὶ τὸν ὅλον κόσμον, διεκόσμησε μία ἡ διὰ πάντων διήκουσα δύναμις, one power, passing
through all things, ordered and formed the whole world. Again he calls the same πνεῦμα καὶ ἔμψυχον καὶ
γόνιμον οὐσίαν, a spirit, and a living and Generative Nature, and plainly declares it to be a thing distinct from
the Deity, but subordinate to it and dependent on it. But Aristotle himself, in that genuine work of his before
mentioned, speaks clearly and positively concerning the Plastick Nature of the Universe, as well as that of animals,
in these words: ‘It seemeth that as there is Art in Artificial things, so in the things of Nature, there is another
such like Principle or Cause, which we ourselves partake of: in the same manner as we do of Heat and Cold,
from the Universe. Wherefore it is more probable that the whole world was at first made by such a cause as this
(if at least it were made) and that it is still conserved by the same, than mortal animals should be so: for there
is much more of order and determinate Regularity in the Heavenly Bodies that in ourselves; but more of Fortuitousness
and inconstant Regularity among these mortal things. Notwithstanding which, some there are, who
though they cannot but acknowledge that the Bodies of Animals were all framed by an Artificial Nature, yet
they will need contend that the System of the Heavens sprung merely from Fortune and Chance; although there
be not the least appearance of Fortuitousness or Temerity in it.’ And then he sums up all into this conclusion:
ὥστε εἶναι φανερὸν ὅτι ἔστι τι τοιοῦτον ὃ δὴ καὶ καλοῦμεν φύσιν. ‘Wherefore it is manifest that there is some
such thing as that which we call Nature,’ that is, that there is not only an ‘Artificial,’ ‘Methodical,’ and Plastick
Nature in Animals, by which their respective Bodies are Framed and Conserved, but also that there is such a</note>

<p>4. It is not thus with us. Why? Because we incessantly move the ancient landmarks
which our fathers have set.1625 We encroach, we add house to house, field to field, to enrich
ourselves at the expense of our neighbour. The great fish know the sojourning place that
nature has assigned to them; they occupy the sea far from the haunts of men, where no islands
lie, and where are no continents rising to confront them, because it has never been crossed
and neither curiosity nor need has persuaded sailors to tempt it. The monsters that dwell
in this sea are in size like high mountains, so witnesses who have seen tell us, and never
cross their boundaries to ravage islands and seaboard towns. Thus each kind is as if it were
stationed in towns, in villages, in an ancient country, and has for its dwelling place the regions
of the sea which have been assigned to it.</p>
<p>Instances have, however, been known of migratory fish, who, as if common deliberation
transported them into strange regions, all start on their march at a given sign. When the
time marked for breeding arrives, they, as if awakened by a common law of nature, migrate
from gulf to gulf, directing their course toward the North Sea. And at the epoch of their
return you may see all these fish streaming like a torrent across the Propontis towards the
Euxine Sea. Who puts them in marching array? Where is the prince’s order? Has an edict
affixed in the public place indicated to them their day of departure? Who serves them as a
guide? See how the divine order embraces all and extends to the smallest object. A fish
does not resist God’s law, and we men cannot endure His precepts of salvation! Do not
despise fish because they are dumb and quite unreasoning; rather fear lest, in your resistance
to the disposition of the Creator, you have even less reason than they. Listen to the fish,
who by their actions all but speak and say: it is for the perpetuation of our race that we
undertake this long voyage. They have not the gift of reason, but they have the law of nature
firmly seated within them, to show them what they have to do. Let us go, they say, to the
North Sea. Its water is sweeter than that of the rest of the sea; for the sun does not remain
long there, and its rays do not draw up all the drinkable portions.1626 Even sea creatures
love fresh water.1627 Thus one often sees them enter into rivers and swim far up them from
the sea. This is the reason which makes them prefer the Euxine Sea to other gulfs, as the
most fit for breeding and for bringing up their young. When they have obtained their object
the whole tribe returns home. Let us hear these dumb creatures tell us the reason. The
Northern sea, they say, is shallow and its surface is exposed to the violence of the wind, and
it has few shores and retreats. Thus the winds easily agitate it to its bottom and mingle the

sands of its bed with its waves. Besides, it is cold in winter, filled as it is from all directions
by large rivers. Wherefore after a moderate enjoyment of its waters, during the summer,
when the winter comes they hasten to reach warmer depths and places heated by the sun,
and after fleeing from the stormy tracts of the North, they seek a haven in less agitated seas.</p>
<p>5. I myself have seen these marvels, and I have admired the wisdom of God in all things.
If beings deprived of reason are capable of thinking and of providing for their own preservation;
if a fish knows what it ought to seek and what to shun, what shall we say, who are
honoured with reason, instructed by law, encouraged by the promises, made wise by the
Spirit, and are nevertheless less reasonable about our own affairs than the fish? They know
how to provide for the future, but we renounce our hope of the future and spend our life in
brutal indulgence. A fish traverses the extent of the sea to find what is good for it; what will
you say then—you who live in idleness, the mother of all vices?1628 Do not let any one make
his ignorance an excuse. There has been implanted in us natural reason which tells us to
identify ourselves with good, and to avoid all that is harmful. I need not go far from the sea
to find examples, as that is the object of our researches. I have heard it said by one living
near the sea, that the sea urchin, a little contemptible creature, often foretells calm and
tempest to sailors. When it foresees a disturbance of the winds, it gets under a great pebble,
and clinging to it as to an anchor, it tosses about in safety, retained by the weight which
prevents it from becoming the plaything of the waves.1629 It is a certain sign for sailors that
they are threatened with a violent agitation of the winds. No astrologer, no Chaldæan,
reading in the rising of the stars the disturbances of the air, has ever communicated his
secret to the urchin: it is the Lord of the sea and of the winds who has impressed on this
little animal a manifest proof of His great wisdom. God has foreseen all, He has neglected
nothing. His eye, which never sleeps, watches over all.1630 He is present everywhere and
gives to each being the means of preservation. If God has not left the sea urchin outside
His providence, is He without care for you?</p>
<p>“Husbands love your wives.”1631 Although formed of two bodies you are united to live
in the communion of wedlock. May this natural link, may this yoke imposed by the blessing,
reunite those who are divided. The viper, the cruelest of reptiles, unites itself with the sea
lamprey, and, announcing its presence by a hiss, it calls it from the depths to conjugal union.

The lamprey obeys, and is united to this venomous animal.1632 What does this mean?
However hard, however fierce a husband may be, the wife ought to bear with him, and not
wish to find any pretext for breaking the union. He strikes you, but he is your husband.
He is a drunkard, but he is united to you by nature. He is brutal and cross, but he is
henceforth one of your members, and the most precious of all.</p>
<p>6. Let husbands listen as well: here is a lesson for them. The viper vomits forth its
venom in respect for marriage; and you, will you not put aside the barbarity and the inhumanity
of your soul, out of respect for your union? Perhaps the example of the viper contains
another meaning. The union of the viper and of the lamprey is an adulterous violation of
nature. You, who are plotting against other men’s wedlock, learn what creeping creature
you are like. I have only one object, to make all I say turn to the edification of the Church.
Let then libertines put a restraint on their passions, for they are taught by the examples set
by creatures of earth and sea.</p>
<p>My bodily infirmity and the lateness of the hour force me to end my discourse. However,
I have still many observations to make on the products of the sea, for the admiration of my
attentive audience. To speak of the sea itself, how does its water change into salt? How is
it that coral, a stone so much esteemed, is a plant in the midst of the sea, and when once
exposed to the air becomes hard as a rock? Why has nature enclosed in the meanest of animals,
in an oyster, so precious an object as a pearl? For these pearls, which are coveted by
the caskets of kings, are cast upon the shores, upon the coasts, upon sharp rocks, and enclosed
in oyster shells. How can the sea pinna produce her fleece of gold, which no dye has ever
imitated?1633 How can shells give kings purple of a brilliancy not surpassed by the flowers
of the field?</p>
<p>“Let the waters bring forth.” What necessary object was there that did not immediately
appear? What object of luxury was not given to man? Some to supply his needs, some to
make him contemplate the marvels of creation. Some are terrible, so as to take our idleness
to school. “God created great whales.”1634 Scripture gives them the name of “great” not
because they are greater than a shrimp and a sprat, but because the size of their bodies equals
that of great hills. Thus when they swim on the surface of the waters one often sees them
appear like islands. But these monstrous creatures do not frequent our coasts and shores;

they inhabit the Atlantic ocean. Such are these animals created to strike us with terror and
awe. If now you hear say that the greatest vessels, sailing with full sails, are easily stopped
by a very small fish, by the remora, and so forcibly that the ship remains motionless for a
long time, as if it had taken root in the middle of the sea,1635 do you not see in this little
creature a like proof of the power of the Creator? Sword fish, saw fish, dog fish, whales, and
sharks, are not therefore the only things to be dreaded; we have to fear no less the spike of
the stingray even after its death,1636 and the sea-hare,1637 whose mortal blows are as rapid
as they are inevitable. Thus the Creator wishes that all may keep you awake, so that full of
hope in Him you may avoid the evils with which all these creatures threaten you.</p>
<p>But let us come out of the depths of the sea and take refuge upon the shore. For the
marvels of creation, coming one after the other in constant succession like the waves, have
submerged my discourse. However, I should not be surprised if, after finding greater wonders
upon the earth, my spirit seeks like Jonah’s to flee to the sea. But it seems to me, that
meeting with these innumerable marvels has made me forget all measure, and experience
the fate of those who navigate the high seas without a fixed point to mark their progress,
and are often ignorant of the space which they have traversed. This is what has happened
to me; whilst my words glanced at creation, I have not been sensible of the multitude of
beings of which I spoke to you. But although this honourable assembly is pleased by my
speech, and the recital of the marvels of the Master is grateful to the ears of His servants, let
me here bring the ship of my discourse to anchor, and await the day to deliver you the rest.
Let us, therefore, all arise, and, giving thanks for what has been said, let us ask for strength
to hear the rest. Whilst taking your food may the conversation at your table turn upon what
has occupied us this morning and this evening. Filled with these thoughts may you, even
in sleep, enjoy the pleasure of the day, so that you may be permitted to say, “I sleep but my
heart waketh,”1638 meditating day and night upon the law of the Lord, to Whom be glory

<head>The creation of fowl and water animals.1639</head>
<p>1. And God said “Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle and
creeping things, and beast of the earth after his kind; and it was so.”1640 The command of
God advanced step by step and earth thus received her adornment. Yesterday it was said,
“Let the waters produce moving things,” and to-day “let the earth bring forth the living
creature.” Is the earth then alive? And are the mad-minded Manichæans right in giving it
a soul? At these words “Let the earth bring forth,” it did not produce a germ contained in
it, but He who gave the order at the same time gifted it with the grace and power to bring
forth. When the earth had heard this command “Let the earth bring forth grass and the
tree yielding fruit,” it was not grass that it had hidden in it that it caused to spring forth, it
did not bring to the surface a palm tree, an oak, a cypress, hitherto kept back in its depths.
It is the word of God which forms the nature of things created. “Let the earth bring forth;”
that is to say not that she may bring forth that which she has but that she may acquire that
which she lacks, when God gives her the power. Even so now, “Let the earth bring forth the
living creature,” not the living creature that is contained in herself, but that which the
command of God gives her. Further, the Manichæans contradict themselves, because if the
earth has brought forth the life, she has left herself despoiled of life. Their execrable doctrine
needs no demonstration.</p>
<p>But why did the waters receive the command to bring forth the moving creature that
hath life and the earth to bring forth the living creature? We conclude that, by their nature,
swimming creatures appear only to have an imperfect life, because they live in the thick
element of water. They are hard of hearing, and their sight is dull because they see through
the water; they have no memory, no imagination, no idea of social intercourse. Thus divine
language appears to indicate that, in aquatic animals, the carnal life originates their psychic
movements, whilst in terrestrial animals, gifted with a more perfect life,1641 the soul1642
enjoys supreme authority. In fact the greater part of quadrupeds have more power of penetration
in their senses; their apprehension of present objects is keen, and they keep all exact
remembrance of the past. It seems therefore, that God, after the command given to the
waters to bring forth moving creatures that have life, created simply living bodies for
aquatic animals, whilst for terrestrial animals He commanded the soul to exist and to direct
the body, showing thus that the inhabitants of the earth are gifted with greater vital force.

Without doubt terrestrial animals are devoid of reason. At the same time how many affections
of the soul each one of them expresses by the voice of nature! They express by cries
their joy and sadness, recognition of what is familiar to them, the need of food, regret at
being separated from their companions, and numberless emotions. Aquatic animals, on
the contrary, are not only dumb; it is impossible to tame them, to teach them, to train them
for man’s society.1643 “The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib.”1644 But
the fish does not know who feeds him. The ass knows a familiar voice, he knows the road
which he has often trodden, and even, if man loses his way, he sometimes serves him as a
guide. His hearing is more acute than that of any other terrestrial animal. What animal of
the sea can show so much rancour and resentment as the camel? The camel conceals its
resentment for a long time after it has been struck, until it finds an opportunity, and then
repays the wrong. Listen, you whose heart does not pardon, you who practise vengeance
as a virtue; see what you resemble when you keep your anger for so long against your
neighbour like a spark, hidden in the ashes, and only waiting for fuel to set your heart ablaze!</p>
<p>2. “Let the earth bring forth a living soul.” Why did the earth produce a living soul? so
that you may make a difference between the soul of cattle and that of man. You will soon
learn how the human soul was formed; hear now about the soul of creatures devoid of
reason. Since, according to Scripture, “the life of every creature is in the blood,”1645 as the
blood when thickened changes into flesh, and flesh when corrupted decomposes into earth,
so the soul of beasts is naturally an earthy substance. “Let the earth bring forth a living
soul.” See the affinity of the soul with blood, of blood with flesh, of flesh with earth; and
remounting in an inverse sense from the earth to the flesh, from the flesh to the blood, from
the blood to the soul, you will find that the soul of beasts is earth. Do not suppose that it is
older than the essence1646 of their body, nor that it survives the dissolution of the flesh;1647

of life above, are, as soon as ever those organized bodies of theirs, by reason of their indisposition, become uncapable

and fountain. Since it cannot be doubted but what creates anything out of nothing, or sends it forth from itself,
by free and voluntary emanation, may be able either to retract the same back again to its original source, or else
to annihilate it at pleasure. And I find that there have not wanted some among the Gentile philosophers themselves

avoid the nonsense of those arrogant philosophers who do not blush to liken their soul to
that of a dog; who say that they have been formerly themselves women, shrubs, fish.1648
Have they ever been fish? I do not know; but I do not fear to affirm that in their writings
they show less sense than fish. “Let the earth bring forth the living creature.” Perhaps many
of you ask why there is such a long silence in the middle of the rapid rush of my discourse.
The more studious among my auditors will not be ignorant of the reason why words fail
me. What! Have I not seen them look at each other, and make signs to make me look at
them, and to remind me of what I have passed over? I have forgotten a part of the creation,
and that one of the most considerable, and my discourse was almost finished without
touching upon it. “Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life
and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament, of heaven.”1649 I spoke of
fish as long as eventide allowed: to-day we have passed to the examination of terrestrial
animals; between the two, birds have escaped us. We are forgetful like travellers who unmindful
of some important object, are obliged, although they be far on their road, to retrace
their steps, punished for their negligence by the weariness of the journey. So we have to
turn back. That which we have omitted is not to be despised. It is the third part of the animal
creation, if indeed there are three kinds of animals, land, winged and water.</p>
<p>“Let the waters” it is said “bring forth abundantly moving creature that hath life and fowl
that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.” Why do the waters give birth
also to birds? Because there is, so to say, a family link between the creatures that fly and
those that swim. In the same way that fish cut the waters, using their fins to carry them
forward and their tails to direct their movements round and round and straightforward, so
we see birds float in the air by the help of their wings. Both endowed with the property of
swimming, their common derivation from the waters has made them of one family.1650 At
the same time no bird is without feet, because finding all its food upon the earth it cannot

do without their service. Rapacious birds have pointed claws to enable them to close on
their prey; to the rest has been given the indispensable ministry of feet to seek their food
and to provide for the other needs of life. There are a few who walk badly, whose feet are
neither suitable for walking nor for preying. Among this number are swallows, incapable
of walking and seeking their prey, and the birds called swifts1651 who live on little insects
carried about by the air. As to the swallow, its flight, which grazes the earth, fulfils the
function of feet.</p>
<p>3. There are also innumerable kinds of birds. If we review them all, as we have partly
done the fish, we shall find that under one name, the creatures which fly differ infinitely in
size, form and colour; that in their life, their actions and their manners, they present a
variety equally beyond the power of description. Thus some have tried to imagine names
for them of which the singularity and the strangeness might, like brands, mark the distinctive
character of each kind known. Some, as eagles, have been called Schizoptera, others
Dermoptera, as the bats, others Ptilota, as wasps, others Coleoptera, as beetles and all those
insects which brought forth in cases and coverings, break their prison to fly away in
liberty.1652 But we have enough words of common usage to characterise each species and
to mark the distinction which Scripture sets up between clean and unclean birds. Thus the
species of carnivora is of one sort and of one constitution which suits their manner of living,
sharp talons, curved beak, swift wings, allowing them to swoop easily upon their prey and
to tear it up after having seized it.1653 The constitution of those who pick up seeds is different,
and again that of those who live on all they come across. What a variety in all these creatures!
Some are gregarious, except the birds of prey who know no other society than conjugal
union; but innumerable kinds, doves, cranes, starlings, jackdaws, like a common life.1654
Among them some live without a chief and in a sort of independence; others, as cranes, do
not refuse to submit themselves to a leader. And a fresh difference between them is that
some are stationary and non-migratory; others undertake long voyages and the greater part
of them migrate at the approach of winter. Nearly all birds can be tamed and are capable
of training, except the weakest, who through fear and timidity cannot bear the constant and
annoying contact of the hand. Some like the society of man and inhabit our dwellings;
others delight in mountains and in desert places. There is a great difference too in their
peculiar notes. Some twitter and chatter, others are silent, some have a melodious and
sonorous voice, some are wholly inharmonious and incapable of song; some imitate the
voice of man, taught their mimicry either by nature or training;1655 others always give forth

the same monotonous cry. The cock is proud; the peacock is vain of his beauty; doves and
fowls are amorous, always seeking each other’s society. The partridge is deceitful and jealous,
lending perfidious help to the huntsmen to seize their prey.1656</p>
<p>4. What a variety, I have said, in the actions and lives of flying creatures. Some of these
unreasoning creatures even have a government, if the feature of government is to make the
activity of all the individuals centre in one common end. This may be observed in bees.
They have a common dwelling place; they fly in the air together, they work at the same work
together; and what is still more extraordinary is that they give themselves to these labours
under the guidance of a king and superintendent, and that they do not allow themselves to
fly to the meadows without seeing if the king is flying at their head. As to this king, it is not
election that gives him this authority; ignorance on the part of the people often puts the
worst man in power; it is not fate; the blind decisions of fate often give authority to the most
unworthy. It is not heredity that places him on the throne; it is only too common to see the
children of kings, corrupted by luxury and flattery, living in ignorance of all virtue. It is
nature which makes the king of the bees, for nature gives him superior size, beauty, and
sweetness of character. He has a sting like the others, but he does not use it to revenge
himself.1657 It is a principle of natural and unwritten law, that those who are raised to high
office, ought to be lenient in punishing. Even bees who do not follow the example of their
king, repent without delay of their imprudence, since they lose their lives with their sting.
Listen, Christians, you to whom it is forbidden to “recompense evil for evil” and commanded
“to overcome evil with good.”1658 Take the bee for your model, which constructs its cells
without injuring any one and without interfering with the goods of others. It gathers openly
wax from the flowers with its mouth, drawing in the honey scattered over them like dew,
and injects it into the hollow of its cells. Thus at first honey is liquid; time thickens it and
gives it its sweetness.1659 The book of Proverbs has given the bee the most honourable and
the best praise by calling her wise and industrious.1660 How much activity she exerts in

gathering this precious nourishment, by which both kings and men of low degree are brought
to health! How great is the art and cunning she displays in the construction of the store
houses which are destined to receive the honey! After having spread the wax like a thin
membrane, she distributes it in contiguous compartments which, weak though they are, by
their number and by their mass, sustain the whole edifice. Each cell in fact holds to the one
next to it, and is separated by a thin partition; we thus see two or three galleries of cells built
one upon the other. The bee takes care not to make one vast cavity, for fear it might break
under the weight of the liquid, and allow it to escape. See how the discoveries of geometry
are mere by-works to the wise bee!1661</p>
<p>The rows of honey-comb are all hexagonal with equal sides. They do not bear on each
other in straight lines, lest the supports should press on empty spaces between and give way;
but the angles of the lower hexagons serve as foundations and bases to those which rise
above, so as to furnish a sure support to the lower mass, and so that each cell may securely
keep the liquid honey.1662</p>
<p>5. How shall we make an exact review of all the peculiarities of the life of birds? During
the night cranes keep watch in turn; some sleep, others make the rounds and procure a quiet
slumber for their companions. After having finished his duty, the sentry utters a cry, and
goes to sleep, and the one who awakes, in his turn, repays the security which he has enjoyed.
1663 You will see the same order reign in their flight. One leads the way, and when
it has guided the flight of the flock for a certain time, it passes to the rear, leaving to the one
who comes after the care of directing the march.</p>
<p>The conduct of storks comes very near intelligent reason. In these regions the same
season sees them all migrate. They all start at one given signal. And it seems to me that our

than it appeared to Basil. “The most wonderful of all known instincts, that of the hive bee, may be explained
by natural selection having taken advantage of numerous slight modifications of simpler instincts; natural
selection having by slow degrees more and more perfectly led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given
distance from each other in a double layer, and to build up and excavate the wax along the planes of intersection.”
Origin of Species, ii. 255, ed. 1861. According to this view the beings from whom hive bees, as we know them,
are descended were gifted with certain simple instincts capable of a kind of hereditary unconscious education,
resulting in a complex instinct which constructs with exact precision the hexagonal chamber best fitted for the
purpose it is designed to fulfil, and then packs it. And it is interesting to note how the great apostle of abstract
selection personifies it as a “taker” of “advantage,” and a “leader.”</note>

crows, serving them as escort, go to bring them back, and to help them against the attacks
of hostile birds. The proof is that in this season not a single crow appears, and that they
return with wounds, evident marks of the help and of the assistance that they have lent.
Who has explained to them the laws of hospitality? Who has threatened them with the
penalties of desertion? For not one is missing from the company. Listen, all inhospitable
hearts, ye who shut your doors, whose house is never open either in the winter or in the
night to travellers. The solicitude of storks for their old would be sufficient, if our children
would reflect upon it, to make them love their parents; because there is no one so failing in
good sense, as not to deem it a shame to be surpassed in virtue by birds devoid of reason.
The storks surround their father, when old age makes his feathers drop off, warm him with
their wings, and provide abundantly for his support, and even in their flight they help him
as much as they are able, raising him gently on each side upon their wings, a conduct so
notorious that it has given to gratitude the name of “antipelargosis.”1664 Let no one lament
poverty; let not the man whose house is bare despair of his life, when he considers the industry
of the swallow. To build her nest, she brings bits of straw in her beak; and, as she cannot
raise the mud in her claws, she moistens the end of her wings in water and then rolls in very
fine dust and thus procures mud.1665 After having united, little by little, the bits of straw
with this mud, as with glue, she feeds her young; and if any one of them has its eyes injured,
she has a natural remedy to heal the sight of her little ones.1666</p>
<p>This sight ought to warn you not to take to evil ways on account of poverty; and, even
if you are reduced to the last extremity, not to lose all hope; not to abandon yourself to inaction
and idleness, but to have recourse to God. If He is so bountiful to the swallow, what
will He not do for those who call upon Him with all their heart?</p>
<p>The halcyon is a sea bird, which lays its eggs along the shore, or deposits them in the
sand. And it lays in the middle of winter, when the violence of the winds dashes the sea
against the land. Yet all winds are hushed, and the wave of the sea grows calm, during the
seven days that the halcyon sits.1667</p>

<p>For it only takes seven days to hatch the young. Then, as they are in need of food so
that they may grow, God, in His munificence, grants another seven days to this tiny animal.
All sailors know this, and call these days halcyon days. If divine Providence has established
these marvellous laws in favour of creatures devoid of reason, it is to induce you to ask for
your salvation from God. Is there a wonder which He will not perform for you—you have
been made in His image, when for so little a bird, the great, the fearful sea is held in check

<p>6. It is said that the turtle-dove, once separated from her mate, does not contract a new
union, but remains in widowhood, in remembrance of her first alliance.1668 Listen, O women!
What veneration for widowhood, even in these creatures devoid of reason, how they
prefer it to an unbecoming multiplicity of marriages. The eagle shows the greatest injustice
in the education which she gives to her young. When she has hatched two little ones, she
throws one on the ground, thrusting it out with blows from her wings, and only acknowledges
the remaining one. It is the difficulty of finding food which has made her repulse the offspring
she has brought forth. But the osprey, it is said, will not allow it to perish, she carries
it away and brings it up with her young ones.1669 Such are parents who, under the plea of
poverty, expose their children; such are again those who, in the distribution of their inheritance,
make unequal divisions. Since they have given existence equally to each of their
children, it is just that they should equally and without preference furnish them with the
means of livelihood. Beware of imitating the cruelty of birds with hooked talons. When
they see their young are from henceforth capable of encountering the air in their flight, they
throw them out of the nest, striking them and pushing them with their wings, and do not
take the least care of them. The love of the crow for its young is laudable! When they begin
to fly, she follows them, gives them food, and for a very long time provides for their nourishment.
Many birds have no need of union with males to conceive. But their eggs are unfruitful,
except those of vultures, who more often, it is said, bring forth without coupling:1670
and this although they have a very long life, which often reaches its hundredth year. Note

above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.” They received the command to fly above
the earth because earth provides them with nourishment. “In the firmament of heaven,”
that is to say, as we have said before, in that part of the air called οὐρανός, heaven,1672 from
the word ὁρᾶν, which means to see;1673 called firmament, because the air which extends
over our heads, compared to the æther, has greater density, and is thickened by the vapours
which exhale from the earth. You have then heaven adorned, earth beautified, the sea
peopled with its own creatures, the air filled with birds which scour it in every direction.

city? When enemies were advancing by subterranean passages to possess themselves of the
capitol of Rome, did not geese announce the danger?1676 Is there any kind of bird whose
nature offers nothing for our admiration? Who announces to the vultures that there will
be carnage when men march in battle array against one another? You may see flocks of
vultures following armies and calculating the result of warlike preparations;1677 a calculation
very nearly approaching to human reasoning. How can I describe to you the fearful invasions
of locusts, which rise everywhere at a given signal, and pitch their camps all over a country?
They do not attack crops until they have received the divine command. Or shall I describe

with oil, because it stops up their pores. Wash them with vinegar, the pores reopen and the
animal returns to life. Our God has created nothing unnecessarily and has omitted nothing
that is necessary. If now you cast your eyes upon aquatic creatures, you will find that their
organization is quite different. Their feet are not split like those of the crow, nor hooked
like those of the carnivora, but large and membraneous; therefore they can easily swim,
pushing the water with the membranes of their feet as with oars. Notice how the swan
plunges his neck into the depths of the water to draw his food from it, and you will understand
the wisdom of the Creator in giving this creature a neck longer than his feet, so that
he may throw it like a line, and take the food hidden at the bottom of the water.1681</p>
<p>8. If we simply read the words of Scripture we find only a few short syllables. “Let the
waters bring forth fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven,” but
if we enquire into the meaning of these words, then the great wonder of the wisdom of the
Creator appears. What a difference He has foreseen among winged creatures! How He has
divided them by kinds! How He has characterized each one of them by distinct qualities!
But the day will not suffice me to recount the wonders of the air. Earth is calling me to describe
wild beasts, reptiles and cattle, ready to show us in her turn sights rivalling those of
plants, fish, and birds. “Let the earth bring forth the living soul” of domestic animals, of
wild beasts, and of reptiles after their kind. What have you to say, you who do not believe
in the change that Paul promises you in the resurrection, when you see so many metamorphoses
among creatures of the air? What are we not told of the horned worm of India! First
it changes into a caterpillar,1682 then becomes a buzzing insect, and not content with this
form, it clothes itself, instead of wings, with loose, broad plates. Thus, O women, when you
are seated busy with your weaving, I mean of the silk which is sent you by the Chinese to
make your delicate dresses,1683 remember the metamorphoses of this creature, conceive a
clear idea of the resurrection, and do not refuse to believe in the change that Paul announces
for all men.</p>

detained you so long without profit. For what would you have done until the evening? You
are not pressed by guests, nor expected at banquets. Let me then employ this bodily fast to
rejoice your souls. You have often served the flesh for pleasure, to-day persevere in the
ministry of the soul. “Delight thyself also in the Lord and he shall give thee the desire of
thine heart.”1684 Do you love riches? Here are spiritual riches. “The judgments of the Lord
are true and righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold and precious
stones.”1685 Do you love enjoyment and pleasures? Behold the oracles of the Lord, which,
for a healthy soul, are “sweeter than honey and the honey-comb.”1686 If I let you go, and
if I dismiss this assembly, some will run to the dice, where they will find bad language, sad
quarrels and the pangs of avarice. There stands the devil, inflaming the fury of the players
with the dotted bones,1687 transporting the same sums of money from one side of the table
to the other, now exalting one with victory and throwing the other into despair, now swelling
the first with boasting and covering his rival with confusion.1688 Of what use is bodily
fasting and filling the soul with innumerable evils? He who does not play spends his leisure
elsewhere. What frivolities come from his mouth! What follies strike his ears! Leisure
without the fear of the Lord is, for those who do not know the value of time, a school of
vice.1689 I hope that my words will be profitable; at least by occupying you here they have
prevented you from sinning. Thus the longer I keep you, the longer you are out of the way

creation, but if he thinks of our weakness and of the measure one ought to keep in that
which tends to pleasure. Earth has welcomed you with its own plants, water with its fish,
air with its birds; the continent in its turn is ready to offer you as rich treasures. But let us
put an end to this morning banquet, for fear satiety may blunt your taste for the evening

<head>The creation of terrestrial animals.</head>
<p>1. How did you like the fare of my morning’s discourse? It seemed to me that I had
the good intentions of a poor giver of a feast, who, ambitious of having the credit of keeping
a good table saddens his guests by the poor supply of the more expensive dishes. In vain
he lavishly covers his table with his mean fare; his ambition only shows his folly. It is for
you to judge if I have shared the same fate. Yet, whatever my discourse may have been, take
care lest you disregard it. No one refused to sit at the table of Elisha; and yet he only gave
his friends wild vegetables.1690 I know the laws of allegory, though less by myself than from
the works of others. There are those truly, who do not admit the common sense of the
Scriptures, for whom water is not water, but some other nature, who see in a plant, in a fish,
what their fancy wishes, who change the nature of reptiles and of wild beasts to suit their
allegories, like the interpreters of dreams who explain visions in sleep to make them serve
their own ends. For me grass is grass; plant, fish, wild beast, domestic animal, I take all in
the literal sense.1691 “For I am not ashamed of the gospel.”1692 Those who have written
about the nature of the universe have discussed at length the shape of the earth. If it be
spherical or cylindrical, if it resemble a disc and is equally rounded in all parts, or if it has
the forth of a winnowing basket and is hollow in the middle;1693 all these conjectures have
been suggested by cosmographers, each one upsetting that of his predecessor. It will not
lead me to give less importance to the creation of the universe, that the servant of God,
Moses, is silent as to shapes; he has not said that the earth is a hundred and eighty thousand
furlongs in circumference; he has not measured into what extent of air its shadow projects
itself whilst the sun revolves around it, nor stated how this shadow, casting itself upon the
moon, produces eclipses. He has passed over in silence, as useless, all that is unimportant
for us. Shall I then prefer foolish wisdom to the oracles of the Holy Spirit? Shall I not rather
exalt Him who, not wishing to fill our minds with these vanities, has regulated all the economy
of Scripture in view of the edification and the making perfect of our souls? It is this

which those seem to me not to have understood, who, giving themselves up to the distorted
meaning of allegory, have undertaken to give a majesty of their own invention to Scripture.
It is to believe themselves wiser than the Holy Spirit, and to bring forth their own ideas under
a pretext of exegesis. Let us hear Scripture as it has been written.</p>
<p>2. “Let the earth bring forth the living creature.”1694 Behold the word of God pervading
creation, beginning even then the efficacy which is seen displayed to-day, and will be displayed
to the end of the world! As a ball, which one pushes, if it meet a declivity, descends,
carried by its form and the nature of the ground and does not stop until it has reached a
level surface; so nature, once put in motion by the Divine command, traverses creation with
an equal step, through birth and death, and keeps up the succession of kinds through resemblance,
to the last.1695 Nature always makes a horse succeed to a horse, a lion to a lion,
an eagle to an eagle, and preserving each animal by these uninterrupted successions she
transmits it to the end of all things. Animals do not see their peculiarities destroyed or effaced
by any length of time; their nature, as though it had been just constituted, follows the course
of ages, for ever young.1696 “Let the earth bring forth the living creature.” This command
has continued and earth does not cease to obey the Creator. For, if there are creatures which
are successively produced by their predecessors, there are others that even to-day we see
born from the earth itself. In wet weather she brings forth grasshoppers and an immense
number of insects which fly in the air and have no names because they are so small; she also
produces mice and frogs. In the environs of Thebes in Egypt, after abundant rain in hot
weather, the country is covered with field mice.1697 We see mud alone produce eels; they
do not proceed from an egg, nor in any other manner; it is the earth alone which gives them
birth.1698 Let the earth produce a living creature.”</p>
<p>Cattle are terrestrial and bent towards the earth. Man, a celestial growth, rises superior
to them as much by the mould of his bodily conformation as by the dignity of his soul.

thy eyes look up.1699 When therefore thou degradest thyself by the passions of the flesh,
slave of thy belly, and thy lowest parts, thou approachest animals without reason and becomest
like one of them.1700 Thou art called to more noble cares; “seek those things which
are above where Christ sitteth.”1701 Raise thy soul above the earth; draw from its natural
conformation the rule of thy conduct; fix thy conversation in heaven. Thy true country is
the heavenly Jerusalem;1702 thy fellow-citizens and thy compatriots are “the first-born which

<p>3. “Let the earth bring forth the living creature.” Thus when the soul of brutes appeared
it was not concealed in the earth, but it was born by the command of God. Brutes have one
and the same soul of which the common characteristic is absence of reason. But each animal
is distinguished by peculiar qualities. The ox is steady, the ass is lazy, the horse has strong
passions, the wolf cannot be tamed, the fox is deceitful, the stag timid, the ant industrious,
the dog grateful and faithful in his friendships. As each animal was created the distinctive
character of his nature appeared in him in due measure; in the lion spirit, taste for solitary
life, an unsociable character. True tyrant of animals, he, in his natural arrogance, admits
but few to share his honours. He disdains his yesterday’s food and never returns to the remains
of the prey. Nature has provided his organs of voice with such great force that often
much swifter animals are caught by his roaring alone. The panther, violent and impetuous
in his leaps, has a body fitted for his activity and lightness, in accord with the movements
of his soul. The bear has a sluggish nature, ways of its own, a sly character, and is very secret;
therefore it has an analogous body, heavy, thick, without articulations such as are necessary
for a cold dweller in dens.</p>
<p>When we consider the natural and innate care that these creatures without reason take
of their lives we shall be induced to watch over ourselves and to think of the salvation of
our souls; or rather we shall be the more condemned when we are found falling short even
of the imitation of brutes. The bear, which often gets severely wounded, cares for himself
and cleverly fills the wounds with mullein, a plant whose nature is very astringent. You will
also see the fox heal his wounds with droppings from the pine tree; the tortoise, gorged with

and the serpent heals sore eyes by eating fennel.1705</p>
<p>And is not reasoning intelligence eclipsed by animals in their provision for atmospheric
changes? Do we not see sheep, when winter is approaching, devouring grass with avidity
as if to make provision for future scarcity? Do we not also see oxen, long confined in the
winter season, recognise the return of spring by a natural sensation, and look to the end of
their stables towards the doors, all turning their heads there by common consent? Studious
observers have remarked that the hedgehog makes an opening at the two extremities of his
hole. If the wind from the north is going to blow he shuts up the aperture which looks towards
the north; if the south wind succeeds it the animal passes to the northern door.1706
What lesson do these animals teach man? They not only show us in our Creator a care
which extends to all beings, but a certain presentiment of future even in brutes. Then we
ought not to attach ourselves to this present life and ought to give all heed to that which is
to come. Will you not be industrious for yourself, O man? And will you not lay up in the
present age rest in that which is to come, after having seen the example of the ant? The ant
during summer collects treasures for winter. Far from giving itself up to idleness, before
this season has made it feel its severity, it hastens to work with an invincible zeal until it has
abundantly filled its storehouses. Here again, how far it is from being negligent! With what
wise foresight it manages so as to keep its provisions as long as possible! With its pincers
it cuts the grains in half, for fear lest they should germinate and not serve for its food. If
they are damp it dries them; and it does not spread them out in all weathers, but when it
feels that the air will keep of a mild temperature. Be sure that you will never see rain fall
from the clouds so long as the ant has left the grain out.1707</p>

them? And what time would be sufficient to relate them? Let us say, then, with the prophet,

not be able to say in self-justification, that we have learnt useful knowledge in books, since
the untaught law of nature makes us choose that which is advantageous to us. Do you know
what good you ought to do your neighbour? The good that you expect from him yourself.
Do you know what is evil? That which you would not wish another to do to you. Neither
botanical researches nor the experience of simples have made animals discover those which
are useful to them; but each knows naturally what is salutary and marvellously appropriates
what suits its nature.</p>
<p>4. Virtues exist in us also by nature, and the soul has affinity with them not by education,
but by nature herself. We do not need lessons to hate illness, but by ourselves we repel what
afflicts us, the soul has no need of a master to teach us to avoid vice. Now all vice is a sickness
of the soul as virtue is its health. Thus those have defined health well who have called it a
regularity in the discharge of natural functions; a definition that can be applied without fear
to the good condition of the soul. Thus, without having need of lessons, the soul can attain
by herself to what is fit and conformable to nature.1709 Hence it comes that temperance
everywhere is praised, justice is in honour, courage admired, and prudence the object of all
<note type="footnote">1709 This is the Stoic doctrine. “Stoicorum quidem facilis conclusio est; qui cum finem bonorum esse senserint,
congruere naturæ, cumque ea convenienter vivere.” cf. Cic., De Fin. iii. 7, 26, and De Nat. D. i. 14, and Hor., Ep.,
i. x. 12. “Vivere naturæ si convenienter oportet.” So the Stoics’ main rule of life is ὁμολογουμένως τῇ φύσει
ζῆν. But with Basil this apparent disregard of the doctrine of original sin and the need of grace for redemption
must be understood in the light of the catholic doctrine that sin is the corruption of human nature (cf. Art. ix.
of Original or Birth Sin), which nature, though corrupt and prone to evil, retains capacities for good. But these
capacities do need grace and training. cf. Basil’s Homily on Ps. xlv. 166. “What is said about the Saviour had a
double sense on account of the nature of the Godhead and the Economy of the incarnation. So, looking to the
humanity of God, it is said ‘thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity,’ instead of saying ‘the rest of men
by toil and discipline and careful attention mostly attain a disposition towards good and an aversion from vice.
But thou hast a kind of natural relationship to good and alienation from iniquity.’ And so to us, if we will, it is
not hard to acquire a love of righteousness and a hatred of iniquity.” i.e. In Christ, redeemed humanity loves
good, and all men ‘naturally’ do need toil and discipline. The heredity of sin is recognised by Basil. (e.g. in Hom.
in Famen. 7.) Man fell from grace given, and must return to it. (Serm. Ascet. in init.) It must always be remembered
that questions of original sin, the will, and grace never had the same importance in the Greek as they
had in the Latin church. cf. Dr. Travers Smith on St. Basil (c. ix. p. 108) and Böhringer (Das Vierte Jahrhundert.
Basil, p. 102) who remarks: Wenn er auch noch von einer “Wieder herstellung des freien Willens, den wir zu
brauchbaren Gefässen für den Herrn und zu jedem guten Werke fähig Werden” (De spir. sanct. 18) spricht, so hat
er dies doch nirgends begründet, obschon er bei der Besprechung der Folgen des Falls zuweilen sich äussert, es sei
der Mensch der von dem Schöpfer erhaltenen Freiheit beraubt worden. Im Allgemeinen setzt er den freien Willen
auch nach dem Fall im Menschen so gut wieder Voraus, wie vor dem Fall, so dass jene Aeusserungen kaum mehr</note>

aims; virtues which concern the soul more than health concerns the body. Children love1710
your parents, and you, “parents provoke not your children to wrath.”1711 Does not nature
say the same? Paul teaches us nothing new; he only tightens the links of nature. If the lioness
loves her cubs, if the she wolf fights to defend her little ones, what shall man say who is unfaithful
to the precept and violates nature herself; or the son who insults the old age of his
father; or the father whose second marriage has made him forget his first children?</p>
<p>With animals invincible affection unites parents with children. It is the Creator, God
Himself, who substitutes the strength of feeling for reason in them. From whence it comes
that a lamb as it bounds from the fold, in the midst of a thousand sheep recognises the colour
and the voice of its mother, runs to her, and seeks its own sources of milk. If its mother’s
udders are dry, it is content, and, without stopping, passes by more abundant ones. And
how does the mother recognise it among the many lambs? All have the same voice, the
same colour, the same smell, as far at least as regards our sense of smell. Yet there is in these
animals a more subtle sense than our perception which makes them recognise their own.1712
The little dog has as yet no teeth, nevertheless he defends himself with his mouth against
any one who teases him. The calf has as yet no horns, nevertheless he already knows where
his weapons will grow.1713 Here we have evident proof that the instinct of animals is innate,
and that in all beings there is nothing disorderly, nothing unforeseen. All bear the marks
of the wisdom of the Creator, and show that they have come to life with the means of assuring
their preservation.</p>
<p>The dog is not gifted with a share of reason; but with him instinct has the power of
reason. The dog has learnt by nature the secret of elaborate inferences, which sages of the
world, after long years of study, have hardly been able to disentangle. When the dog is on
the track of game, if he sees it divide in different directions, he examines these different
paths, and speech alone fails him to announce his reasoning. The creature, he says, is gone
here or there or in another direction. It is neither here nor there; it is therefore in the third
direction. And thus, neglecting the false tracks, he discovers the true one. What more is

Many are said to have fallen dead by their murdered masters in lonely places.1715 Others,
when a crime has just been committed, have led those who were searching for the murderers,
and have caused the criminals to be brought to justice. What will those say who, not content
with not loving the Master who has created them and nourished them, have for their friends
men whose mouth attacks the Lord, sitting at the same table with them, and, whilst partaking
of their food, blaspheme Him who has given it to them?</p>
<p>5. But let us return to the spectacle of creation. The easiest animals to catch are the
most productive. It is on account of this that hares and wild goats produce many little ones,
and that wild sheep have twins, for fear lest these species should disappear, consumed by
carnivorous animals. Beasts of prey, on the contrary, produce only a few and a lioness with
difficulty gives birth to one lion;1716 because, if they say truly, the cub issues from its
mother by tearing her with its claws; and vipers are only born by gnawing through the womb,
inflicting a proper punishment on their mother.1717 Thus in nature all has been foreseen,
all is the object of continual care. If you examine the members even of animals, you will
find that the Creator has given them nothing superfluous, that He has omitted nothing that
is necessary. To carnivorous animals He has given pointed teeth which their nature requires
for their support. Those that are only half furnished with teeth have received several distinct
receptacles for their food. As it is not broken up enough in the first, they are gifted with the
power of returning it after it has been swallowed, and it does not assimilate until it has been
crushed by rumination. The first, second, third, and fourth stomachs of ruminating animals
do not remain idle; each one of them fulfils a necessary function.1718 The neck of the camel

is long so that it may lower it to its feet and reach the grass on which it feeds. Bears, lions,
tigers, all animals of this sort, have short necks buried in their shoulders; it is because they
do not live upon grass and have no need to bend down to the earth; they are carnivorous
and eat the animals upon whom they prey.</p>
<p>Why has the elephant a trunk? This enormous creature, the greatest of terrestrial animals,
created for the terror of those who meet it, is naturally huge and fleshy. If its neck was
large and in proportion to its feet it would be difficult to direct, and would be of such an
excessive weight that it would make it lean towards the earth. As it is, its head is attached
to the spine of the back by short vertebrae and it has its trunk to take the place of a neck,
and with it it picks up its food and draws up its drink. Its feet, without joints,1719 like united
columns, support the weight of its body. If it were supported on lax and flexible legs, its
joints would constantly give way, equally incapable of supporting its weight, should it wish
either to kneel or rise. But it has under the foot a little ankle joint which takes the place of
the leg and knee joints whose mobility would never have resisted this enormous and swaying
mass. Thus it had need of this nose which nearly touches its feet. Have you seen them in
war marching at the head of the phalanx, like living towers, or breaking the enemies’ battalions
like mountains of flesh with their irresistible charge? If their lower parts were not
in accordance with their size they would never have been able to hold their own. Now we
are told that the elephant lives three hundred years and more,1720 another reason for him
to have solid and unjointed feet. But, as we have said, his trunk, which has the form and
the flexibility of a serpent, takes its food from the earth and raises it up. Thus we are right
in saying that it is impossible to find anything superfluous or wanting in creation. Well!
God has subdued this monstrous animal to us to such a point that he understands the lessons
and endures the blows we give him; a manifest proof that the Creator has submitted all to
our rule, because we have been made in His image. It is not in great animals only that we
see unapproachable wisdom; no less wonders are seen in the smallest. The high tops of the
mountains which, near to the clouds and continually beaten by the winds, keep up a perpetual
winter, do not arouse more admiration in me than the hollow valleys, which escape
the storms of lofty peaks and preserve a constant mild temperature. In the same way in the
constitution of animals I am not more astonished at the size of the elephant, than at the
mouse, who is feared by the elephant, or at the scorpion’s delicate sting, which has been
hollowed like a pipe by the supreme artificer to throw venom into the wounds it makes.
And let nobody accuse the Creator of having produced venomous animals, destroyers and
enemies of our life. Else let them consider it a crime in the schoolmaster when he disciplines
the restlessness of youth by the use of the rod and whip to maintain order.1721</p>

<p>6. Beasts bear witness to the faith. Hast thou confidence in the Lord? “Thou shalt walk
upon the asp and the basilisk and thou shalt trample under feet the lion and the dragon.”1722
With faith thou hast the power to walk upon serpents and scorpions. Do you not see that
the viper which attached itself to the hand of Paul, whilst he gathered sticks, did not injure
him, because it found the saint full of faith? If you have not faith, do not fear beasts so much
as your faithlessness, which renders you susceptible of all corruption. But I see that for a
long time you have been asking me for an account of the creation of man, and I think I can
hear you all cry in your hearts, We are being taught the nature of our belongings, but we
are ignorant of ourselves. Let me then speak of it, since it is necessary, and let me put an
end to my hesitation. In truth the most difficult of sciences is to know one’s self. Not only
our eye, from which nothing outside us escapes, cannot see itself; but our mind, so piercing
to discover the sins of others, is slow to recognise its own faults.1723 Thus my speech, after
eagerly investigating what is external to myself, is slow and hesitating in exploring my own
nature. Yet the beholding of heaven and earth does not make us know God better than the
attentive study of our being does; I am, says the Prophet, fearfully and wonderfully made;1724
that is to say, in observing myself I have known Thy infinite wisdom.1725 And God said
“Let us make man.”1726 Does not the light of theology shine, in these words, as through
windows; and does not the second Person show Himself in a mystical way, without yet
manifesting Himself until the great day? Where is the Jew who resisted the truth and pretended
that God was speaking to Himself? It is He who spoke, it is said, and it is He who
made. “Let there be light and there was light.” But then their words contain a manifest
absurdity. Where is the smith, the carpenter, the shoemaker, who, without help and alone
before the instruments of his trade, would say to himself; let us make the sword, let us put
together the plough, let us make the boot? Does he not perform the work of his craft in silence?
Strange folly, to say that any one has seated himself to command himself, to watch
over himself, to constrain himself, to hurry himself, with the tones of a master! But the
unhappy creatures are not afraid to calumniate the Lord Himself. What will they not say
with a tongue so well practised in lying? Here, however, words stop their mouth; “And God
said let us make man.” Tell me; is there then only one Person? It is not written “Let man

be made,” but, “Let us make man.” The preaching of theology remains enveloped in shadow
before the appearance of him who was to be instructed, but, now, the creation of man is
expected, that faith unveils herself and the dogma of truth appears in all its light. “Let us
make man.” O enemy of Christ, hear God speaking to His Co-operator, to Him by Whom
also He made the worlds, Who upholds all things by the word of His power.1727 But He
does not leave the voice of true religion without answer. Thus the Jews, race hostile to truth,
when they find themselves pressed, act like beasts enraged against man, who roar at the bars
of their cage and show the cruelty and the ferocity of their nature, without being able to assuage
their fury. God, they say, addresses Himself to several persons; it is to the angels before
Him that He says, “Let us make man.” Jewish fiction! a fable whose frivolity shows whence
it has come. To reject one person, they admit many. To reject the Son, they raise servants
to the dignity of counsellors; they make of our fellow slaves the agents in our creation. The
perfect man attains the dignity of an angel; but what creature can be like the Creator? Listen
to the continuation. “In our image.” What have you to reply? Is there one image of God
and the angels? Father and Son have by absolute necessity the same form, but the form is
here understood as becomes the divine, not in bodily shape, but in the proper qualities of
Godhead. Hear also, you who belong to the new concision1728 and who, under the appearance
of Christianity, strengthen the error of the Jews.1729 To Whom does He say, “in our
image,” to whom if it is not to Him who is “the brightness of His glory and the express image
of His person,”1730 “the image of the invisible God”?1731 It is then to His living image, to
Him Who has said “I and my Father are one,”1732 “He that hath seen me hath seen the
Father,”1733 that God says “Let us make man in our image.” Where is the unlikeness1734
in these Beings who have only one image? “So God created man.”1735 It is not “They made.”
Here Scripture avoids the plurality of the Persons. After having enlightened the Jew, it dissipates
the error of the Gentiles in putting itself under the shelter of unity, to make you understand
that the Son is with the Father, and guarding you from the danger of polytheism.
He created him in the image of God. God still shows us His co-operator, because He does
not say, in His image, but in the image of God.</p>

<head>Introduction to the Letters.</head>
<p>Of Saint Basil the extant letters, according to popular ascription, number three hundred
and sixty-six. Of these three hundred and twenty-five, or, according to some, only three
hundred and nineteen are genuine. They are published in three chronological divisions,
the 1st, (Letters 1–46) comprising those written by Basil before his elevation to the episcopate;
the second (47–291) the Letters of the Episcopate; the third (292–366) those which have no
note of time, together with some that are of doubtful genuineness, and a few certainly
spurious.1736 They may be classified as (a) historical, (b) dogmatic, (c) moral and ascetic,
(d) disciplinary, (e) consolatory, (f) commendatory, and (g) familiar. In the historic we
have a vivid picture of his age. The doctrinal are of special value as expressing and defending
the Nicene theology. The moral and ascetic indicate the growing importance of the monastic
institution which Athanasius at about the same time was instrumental in recommending
to the Latin Church. The disciplinary, (notably 188, 199, and 217), to Amphilochius, illustrate
the earlier phases of ecclesiastical law. The consolatory, commendatory, and familiar, have
an immediate biographical value as indicating the character and faith of the writer, and may
not be without use alike as models of Christian feeling and good breeding, and as bringing
comfort in trouble to readers remote in time and place. The text in the following translation
is that of Migne’s edition, except where it is stated to the contrary. Of the inadequacy of
the notes to illustrate the letters as they deserve no one can be more vividly conscious than
myself. But the letters tell their own story.</p>

<head>Letter I.1737</head>
<head>To Eustathius the Philosopher.1738</head>
<p>Much distressed as I was by the flouts of what is called fortune, who always seems to be
hindering my meeting you, I was wonderfully cheered and comforted by your letter, for I
had already been turning over in my mind whether what so many people say is really true,
that there is a certain Necessity or Fate which rules all the events of our lives both great and
small, and that we human beings have control over nothing; or, that at all events, all human
life is driven by a kind of luck.1739 You will be very ready to forgive me for these reflexions,
when you learn by what causes I was led to make them.</p>
<p>On hearing of your philosophy, I entertained a feeling of contempt for the teachers of
Athens, and left it. The city on the Hellespont I passed by, more unmoved than any Ulysses,
passing Sirens’ songs.1740</p>
<p>Asia1741 I admired; but I hurried on to the capital of all that is best in it. When I arrived
home, and did not find you,—the prize which I had sought so eagerly,—there began many
and various unexpected hindrances. First I must miss you because I fell ill; then when you
were setting out for the East I could not start with you; then, after endless trouble, I reached
Syria, but I missed the philosopher, who had set out for Egypt. Then I must set out for
Egypt, a long and weary way, and even there I did not gain my end. But so passionate was
my longing that I must either set out for Persia, and proceed with you to the farthest lands
of barbarism, (you had got there; what an obstinate devil possessed me!) or settle here at
Alexandria. This last I did. I really think that unless, like some tame beast, I had followed
a bough held out to me till I was quite worn out, you would have been driven on and on

say more?</p>
<p>On returning home, I cannot meet you, hindered by lingering ailments. If these do not
get better I shall not be able to meet you even in the winter. Is not all this, as you yourself
say, due to Fate? Is not this Necessity? Does not my case nearly outdo poets’ tales of Tantalus?
But, as I said, I feel better after getting your letter, and am now no longer of the same
mind. When God gives good things I think we must thank Him, and not be angry with
Him while He is controlling their distribution. So if He grant me to join you, I shall think
it best and most delightful; if He put me off, I will gently endure the loss. For He always
rules our lives better than we could choose for ourselves.</p>

<head>Letter II.1743</head>
<head>Basil to Gregory.</head>
<p>1. <del>I recognised your letter, as one recognises one’s friends’ children from their obvious
likeness to their parents. Your saying that to describe the kind of place I live in, before letting
you hear anything about how I live, would not go far towards persuading you to share my
life, was just like you; it was worthy of a soul like yours, which makes nothing of all that
concerns this life here, in comparison with the blessedness which is promised us hereafter.
What I do myself, day and night, in this remote spot, I am ashamed to write. I have abandoned
my life in town, as one sure to lead to countless ills; but I have not yet been able to
get quit of myself. I am like travellers at sea, who have never gone a voyage before, and are
distressed and seasick, who quarrel with the ship because it is so big and makes such a
tossing, and, when they get out of it into the pinnace or dingey, are everywhere and always
seasick and distressed. Wherever they go their nausea and misery go with them. My state
is something like this. I carry my own troubles with me, and so everywhere I am in the
midst of similar discomforts. So in the end I have not got much good out of my solitude.
What I ought to have done; what would have enabled me to keep close to the footprints of
Him who has led the way to salvation—for He says, “If any one will come after me, let him
deny himself and take up his cross, and follow me”1744—is this.</del></p>
<p>2. We must strive after a quiet mind. As well might the eye ascertain an object put before
it while it is wandering restless up and down and sideways, without fixing a steady gaze
upon it, as a mind, distracted by a thousand worldly cares, be able clearly to apprehend the
truth. He who is not yet yoked in the bonds of matrimony is harassed by frenzied cravings,
and rebellious impulses, and hopeless attachments; he who has found his mate is encompassed
with his own tumult of cares; if he is childless, there is desire for children; has he
children? anxiety about their education, attention to his wife,1745 care of his house, oversight
of his servants,1746 misfortunes in trade, quarrels with his neighbours, lawsuits, the risks of
the merchant, the toil of the farmer. Each day, as it comes, darkens the soul in its own way;
and night after night takes up the day’s anxieties, and cheats the mind with illusions in accordance.
Now one way of escaping all this is separation from the whole world; that is, not
bodily separation, but the severance of the soul’s sympathy with the body, and to live so
without city, home, goods, society, possessions, means of life, business, engagements, human

learning, that the heart may readily receive every impress of divine doctrine. Preparation
of heart is the unlearning the prejudices of evil converse. It is the smoothing the waxen
tablet before attempting to write on it.1747</p>
<p>Now solitude is of the greatest use for this purpose, inasmuch as it stills our passions,
and gives room for principle to cut them out of the soul.1748 <del>For just as animals are more
easily controlled when they are stroked, lust and anger, fear and sorrow, the soul’s deadly
foes, are better brought under the control of reason, after being calmed by inaction, and
where there is no continuous stimulation.</del> Let there then be such a place as ours, separate
from intercourse with men, that the tenour of our exercises be not interrupted from without.
Pious exercises nourish the soul with divine thoughts. What state can be more blessed than
to imitate on earth the choruses of angels? to begin the day with prayer, and honour our
Maker with hymns and songs? As the day brightens, to betake ourselves, with prayer attending
on it throughout, to our labours, and to sweeten1749 our work with hymns, as if with
salt? Soothing hymns compose the mind to a cheerful and calm state. Quiet, then, as I have
said, is the first step in our sanctification; the tongue purified from the gossip of the world;
the eyes unexcited by fair colour or comely shape; the ear not relaxing the tone or mind by
voluptuous songs, nor by that especial mischief, the talk of light men and jesters. Thus the
mind, saved from dissipation from without, and not through the senses thrown upon the
world, falls back upon itself, and thereby ascends to the contemplation of God. <del>When1750
that beauty shines about it, it even forgets its very nature; it is dragged down no more by
thought of food nor anxiety concerning dress; it keeps holiday from earthly cares, and devotes
all its energies to the acquisition of the good things which are eternal, and asks only how
may be made to flourish in it self-control and manly courage, righteousness and wisdom,
and all the other virtues, which, distributed under these heads, properly enable the good
man to discharge all the duties of life.</del></p>
<p>3. The study of inspired Scripture is the chief way of finding our duty, for in it we find
both instruction about conduct and the lives of blessed men, delivered in writing, as some
breathing images of godly living, for the imitation of their good works. Hence, in whatever
respect each one feels himself deficient, devoting himself to this imitation, he finds, as from
some dispensary, the due medicine for his ailment. He who is enamoured of chastity dwells
upon the history of Joseph, and from him learns chaste actions, finding him not only pos-

sessed of self-command over pleasure, but virtuously-minded in habit. He is taught endurance
by Job <del>who,1751 not only when the circumstances of life began to turn against him,
and in one moment he was plunged from wealth into penury, and from being the father of
fair children into childlessness, remained the same, keeping the disposition of his soul all
through uncrushed, but was not even stirred to anger against the friends who came to
comfort him, and trampled on him, and aggravated his troubles.</del> Or should he be enquiring
how to be at once meek and great-hearted, hearty against sin, meek towards men, he will
find David noble in warlike exploits, meek and unruffled as regards revenge on enemies.
Such, too, was Moses rising up with great heart upon sinners against God, but with meek
soul bearing their evil-speaking against himself. <del>Thus,1752 generally, as painters, when
they are painting from other pictures, constantly look at the model, and do their best to
transfer its lineaments to their own work, so too must he who is desirous of rendering
himself perfect in all branches of excellency, keep his eyes turned to the lives of the saints
as though to living and moving statues, and make their virtue his own by imitation.</del></p>
 <p><del>4. Prayers, too, after reading, find the soul fresher, and more vigorously stirred by love
towards God. And that prayer is good which imprints a clear idea of God in the soul; and
the having God established in self by means of memory is God’s indwelling. Thus we become
God’s temple, when the continuity of our recollection is not severed by earthly cares; when
the mind is harassed by no sudden sensations; when the worshipper flees from all things
and retreats to God, drawing away all the feelings that invite him to self-indulgence, and
passes his time in the pursuits that lead to virtue.</del></p>
<p>5. This, too, is a very important point to attend to,—knowledge how to converse; to
interrogate without over-earnestness; to answer without desire of display; not to interrupt
a profitable speaker, or to desire ambitiously to put in a word of one’s own; to be measured
in speaking and hearing; not to be ashamed of receiving, or to be grudging in giving information,
nor to pass another’s knowledge for one’s own, as depraved women their supposititious
children, but to refer it candidly to the true parent. The middle tone of voice is best, neither
so low as to be inaudible, nor to be ill-bred from its high pitch. One should reflect first what
one is going to say, and then give it utterance: be courteous when addressed; amiable in
social intercourse; not aiming to be pleasant by facetiousness, but cultivating gentleness in
kind admonitions. Harshness is ever to be put aside, even in censuring.1753 <del>The more you</del>

employ the kind of rebuke used by the prophet who did not in his own person utter the
sentence of condemnation on David after his sin, but by suggesting an imaginary character
made the sinner judge of his own sin, so that, after passing his own sentence, he could not
find fault with the seer who had convicted him.1754</p>
<p>6. From the humble and submissive spirit comes an eye sorrowful and downcast, appearance
neglected, hair rough, dress dirty;1755 so that the appearance which mourners take
pains to present may appear our natural condition. The tunic should be fastened to the
body by a girdle, the belt not going above the flank, like a woman’s, nor left slack, so that
the tunic flows loose, like an idler’s. The gait ought not to be sluggish, which shews a character
without energy, nor on the other hand pushing and pompous, as though our impulses
were rash and wild. The one end of dress is that it should be a sufficient covering alike in
winter and summer. As to colour, avoid brightness; in material, the soft and delicate. To
aim at bright colours in dress is like women’s beautifying when they colour cheeks and hair
with hues other than their own. The tunic ought to be thick enough not to want other help
to keep the wearer warm. The shoes should be cheap but serviceable. In a word, what one
has to regard in dress is the necessary. So too as to food; for a man in good health bread
will suffice, and water will quench thirst; such dishes of vegetables may be added as conduce
to strengthening the body for the discharge of its functions. One ought not to eat with any
exhibition of savage gluttony, but in everything that concerns our pleasures to maintain
moderation, quiet, and self-control; and, all through, not to let the mind forget to think of
God, but to make even the nature of our food, and the constitution of the body that takes
it, a ground and means for offering Him the glory, bethinking us how the various kinds of
food, suitable to the needs of our bodies, are due to the provision of the great Steward of
the Universe. Before meat let grace be said, in recognition alike of the gifts which God gives
now, and which He keeps in store for time to come. Say grace after meat in gratitude for
gifts given and petition for gifts promised. Let there be one fixed hour for taking food, always
the same in regular course, that of all the four and twenty of the day and night barely this

Let sleep be light and easily interrupted, as naturally happens after a light diet; it should be
purposely broken by thoughts about great themes. To be overcome by heavy torpor, with
limbs unstrung, so that a way is readily opened to wild fancies, is to be plunged in daily
death. What dawn is to some this midnight is to athletes of piety; then the silence of night
gives leisure to their soul; no noxious sounds or sights obtrude upon their hearts; the mind
is alone with itself and God, correcting itself by the recollection of its sins, giving itself precepts

<p>1. When I took your letter into my hand, I underwent an experience worth telling. I
looked at it with the awe due to a document making some state announcement, and as I
was breaking the wax, I felt a dread greater than ever guilty Spartan felt at sight of the Laconian
scytale.1759</p>
<p>When, however, I had opened the letter, and read it through, I could not help laughing,
partly for joy at finding nothing alarming in it; partly because I likened your state of affairs
to that of Demosthenes. Demosthenes, you remember, when he was providing for a certain
little company of chorus dancers and musicians, requested to be styled no longer Demosthenes,
but “choragus.”1760 You are always the same, whether playing the “choragus” or
not. “Choragus” you are indeed to soldiers myriads more in number than the individuals
to whom Demosthenes supplied necessaries; and yet you do not when you write to me stand
on your dignity, but keep up the old style. You do not give up the study of literature, but,
as Plato1761 has it, in the midst of the storm and tempest of affairs, you stand aloof, as it
were, under some strong wall, and keep your mind clear of all disturbance; nay, more, as
far as in you lies, you do not even let others be disturbed. Such is your life; great and wonderful
to all who have eyes to see; and yet not wonderful to any one who judges by the whole
purpose of your life.</p>

<p>What do you mean, my dear Sir, by evicting from our retreat my dear friend and nurse

with great fortitude, ‘well done, Fortune! you are reducing me to the old cloak;’1766 a great

his tutors’ fees as well;1767 an immense admirer of Diogenes, who prided himself on requiring

some lad to stoop down and drink from the hollow of his hand.” In some such terms as
these you might be chidden by my dear mate Poverty, whom your presents have driven

<head>To Nectarius.1769</head>
<p>1. I heard of your unendurable loss, and was much distressed. Three or four days went
by, and I was still in some doubt because my informant was not able to give me any clear
details of the melancholy event. While I was incredulous about what was noised abroad,
because I prayed that it might not be true, I received a letter from the Bishop fully confirming
the unhappy tidings. I need not tell you how I sighed and wept. Who could be so stonyhearted,
so truly inhuman, as to be insensible to what has occurred, or be affected by merely
moderate grief? He is gone; heir of a noble house, prop of a family, a father’s hope, offspring
of pious parents, nursed with innumerable prayers, in the very bloom of manhood, torn
from his father’s hands. These things are enough to break a heart of adamant and make it
feel. It is only natural then that I am deeply touched at this trouble; I who have been intimately
connected with you from the beginning and have made your joys and sorrows mine.
But yesterday it seemed that you had only little to trouble you, and that your life’s stream
was flowing prosperously on. In a moment, by a demon’s malice,1770 all the happiness of
the house, all the brightness of life, is destroyed, and our lives are made a doleful story. If
we wish to lament and weep over what has happened, a lifetime will not be enough and if
all mankind mourns with us they will be powerless to make their lamentation match our
loss. Yes, if all the streams run tears1771 they will not adequately weep our woe.</p>
<p>2. But we mean,—do we not?—to bring out the gift which God has stored in our hearts;
I mean that sober reason which in our happy days is wont to draw lines of limitation round
our souls, and when troubles come about us to recall to our minds that we are but men, and
to suggest to us, what indeed we have seen and heard, that life is full of similar misfortunes,
and that the examples of human sufferings are not a few. Above all, this will tell us that it
is God’s command that we who trust in Christ should not grieve over them who are fallen
asleep, because we hope in the resurrection; and that in reward for great patience great
crowns of glory are kept in store by the Master of life’s course. Only let us allow our wiser
thoughts to speak to us in this strain of music, and we may peradventure discover some
slight alleviation of our trouble. Play the man, then, I implore you; the blow is a heavy one,
but stand firm; do not fall under the weight of your grief; do not lose heart. Be perfectly
assured of this, that though the reasons for what is ordained by God are beyond us, yet always

why the terms of life that He fixes for us are unequal. There exists some reason incomprehensible
to man why some are sooner carried far away from us, and some are left a longer
while behind to bear the burdens of this painful life. So we ought always to adore His loving
kindness, and not to repine, remembering those great and famous words of the great athlete
Job, when he had seen ten children at one table, in one short moment, crushed to death,
“The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away.”1772 As the Lord thought good so it came
to pass. Let us adopt those marvellous words. At the hands of the righteous Judge, they
who show like good deeds shall receive a like reward. We have not lost the lad; we have restored
him to the Lender. His life is not destroyed; it is changed for the better. He whom
we love is not hidden in the ground; he is received into heaven. Let us wait a little while,
and we shall be once more with him. The time of our separation is not long, for in this life
we are all like travellers on a journey, hastening on to the same shelter. While one has
reached his rest another arrives, another hurries on, but one and the same end awaits them
all. He has outstripped us on the way, but we shall all travel the same road, and the same
hostelry awaits us all. God only grant that we through goodness may be likened to his purity,
to the end that for the sake of our guilelessness of life we may attain the rest which is granted
to them that are children in Christ.</p>

<head>Letter VI.1773</head>
<head>To the wife of Nectarius.</head>
<p>1. I hesitated to address your excellency, from the idea that, just as to the eye when inflamed
even the mildest of remedies causes pain, so to a soul distressed by heavy sorrow,
words offered in the moment of agony, even though they do bring much comfort, seem to
be somewhat out of place. But I bethought me that I should be speaking to a Christian woman,
who has long ago learned godly lessons, and is not inexperienced in the vicissitudes
of human life, and I judged it right not to neglect the duty laid upon me. I know what a
mother’s heart is,1774 and when I remember how good and gentle you are to all, I can
reckon the probable extent of your misery at this present time. You have lost a son whom,
while he was alive, all mothers called happy, with prayers that their own might be like him,
and on his death bewailed, as though each had hidden her own in the grave. His death is a
blow to two provinces, both to mine and to Cilicia. With him has fallen a great and illustrious
race, dashed to the ground as by the withdrawal of a prop. Alas for the mighty mischief
that the contact with an evil demon was able to wreak! Earth, what a calamity thou hast
been compelled to sustain! If the sun had any feeling one would think he might have
shuddered at so sad a sight. Who could utter all that the spirit in its helplessness would
have said?</p>
<p>2. But our lives are not without a Providence. So we have learnt in the Gospel, for not
a sparrow falls to the ground without the will of our Father.1775 Whatever has come to pass
has come to pass by the will of our Creator. And who can resist God’s will? Let us accept
what has befallen us; for if we take it ill we do not mend the past and we work our own ruin.
Do not let us arraign the righteous judgment of God. We are all too untaught to assail His
ineffable sentences. The Lord is now making trial of your love for Him. Now there is an
opportunity for you, through your patience, to take the martyr’s lot. The mother of the
Maccabees1776 saw the death of seven sons without a sigh, without even shedding one unworthy
tear. She gave thanks to God for seeing them freed from the fetters of the flesh by
fire and steel and cruel blows, and she won praise from God, and fame among men. The
loss is great, as I can say myself; but great too are the rewards laid up by the Lord for the
patient. When first you were made a mother, and saw your boy, and thanked God, you
knew all the while that, a mortal yourself, you had given birth to a mortal. What is there

astonishing in the death of a mortal? But we are grieved at his dying before his time. Are
we sure that this was not his time? We do not know how to pick and choose what is good
for our souls, or how to fix the limits of the life of man. Look round at all the world in which
you live; remember that everything you see is mortal, and all subject to corruption. Look
up to heaven; even it shall be dissolved; look at the sun, not even the sun will last for ever.
All the stars together, all living things of land and sea, all that is fair on earth, aye, earth itself,
all are subject to decay; yet a little while and all shall be no more. Let these considerations
be some comfort to you in your trouble. Do not measure your loss by itself; if you do it will
seem intolerable; but if you take all human affairs into account you will find that some
comfort is to be derived from them. Above all, one thing I would strongly urge; spare your
husband. Be a comfort to others. Do not make his trouble harder to bear by wearing
yourself away with sorrow. Mere words I know cannot give comfort. Just now what is
wanted is prayer; and I do pray the Lord Himself to touch your heart by His unspeakable
power, and through good thoughts to cause light to shine upon your soul, that you may
have a source of consolation in yourself.</p>

that I should be charged with poverty of expression? Still, it was not possible to let your
question pass unnoticed. It looks like a betrayal, if we do not readily give an answer about
God to them that love the Lord. What has been said, however, whether it seems satisfactory,
or requires some further and more careful addition, needs a fit season for correction. For
the present I implore you, as I have implored you before, to devote yourself entirely to the
advocacy of the truth, and to the intellectual energies God gives you for the establishment
of what is good. With this be content, and ask nothing more from me. I am really much
less capable than is supposed, and am more likely to do harm to the word by my weakness

<p>1. I have often been astonished at your feeling towards me as you do, and how it comes
about that an individual so small and insignificant, and having, may be, very little that is
lovable about him, should have so won your allegiance. You remind me of the claims of
friendship and of fatherland,1780 and press me urgently in your attempt to make me come
back to you, as though I were a runaway from a father’s heart and home. That I am a runaway
I confess. I should be sorry to deny it; since you are already regretting me, you shall be told
the cause. I was astounded like a man stunned by some sudden noise. I did not crush my
thoughts, but dwelt upon them as I fled, and now I have been absent from you a considerable
time. Then I began to yearn for the divine doctrines, and the philosophy that is concerned
with them. How, said I, could I overcome the mischief dwelling with us? Who is to be my
Laban, setting me free from Esau, and leading me to the supreme philosophy? By God’s
help, I have, so far as in me lies, attained my object; I have found a chosen vessel, a deep
well; I mean Gregory, Christ’s mouth. Give me, therefore, I beg you, a little time. I am not
embracing a city life.1781 I am quite well aware how the evil one by such means devises
deceit for mankind, but I do hold the society of the saints most useful. For in the more
constant change of ideas about the divine dogmas I am acquiring a lasting habit of contemplation.
Such is my present situation.</p>

from Holy Scripture, but to mar the harmony of the truth by heathen philosophy. Is not

bewitches our Patriarch’s sheep that they may not drink “of the well of water springing up
into everlasting life,”1783 but may rather bring upon themselves the words of the prophet,
“They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken
cisterns, that can hold no water;”1784 when all the while they ought to confess that the
Father is God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God,1785 as they have been taught by the
divine words, and by those who have understood them in their highest sense. Against those
who cast it in our teeth that we are Tritheists, let it be answered that we confess one God
not in number but in nature. For everything which is called one in number is not one absolutely,
nor yet simple in nature; but God is universally confessed to be simple and not
composite. God therefore is not one in number. What I mean is this. We say that the world
is one in number, but not one by nature nor yet simple; for we divide it into its constituent
elements, fire, water, air, and earth.1786 Again, man is called one in number. We frequently
speak of one man, but man who is composed of body and soul is not simple. Similarly we
say one angel in number, but not one by nature nor yet simple, for we conceive of the hypostasis
of the angel as essence with sanctification. If therefore everything which is one in
number is not one in nature, and that which is one and simple in nature is not one in
number; and if we call God one in nature how can number be charged against us, when we
utterly exclude it from that blessed and spiritual nature? Number relates to quantity; and
quantity is conjoined with bodily nature, for number is of bodily nature. We believe our
Lord to be Creator of bodies. Wherefore every number indicates those things which have
received a material and circumscribed nature. Monad and Unity on the other hand signify
the nature which is simple and incomprehensible. Whoever therefore confesses either the
Son of God or the Holy Ghost to be number or creature introduces unawares a material
and circumscribed nature. And by circumscribed I mean not only locally limited, but a
nature which is comprehended in foreknowledge by Him who is about to educe it from the
non-existent into the existent and which can be comprehended by science. Every holy thing
then of which the nature is circumscribed and of which the holiness is acquired is not insus-

ceptible of evil. But the Son and the Holy Ghost are the source of sanctification by which
every reasonable creature is hallowed in proportion to its virtue.</p>
<p>3. We in accordance with the true doctrine speak of the Son as neither like,1787 nor
unlike1788 the Father. Each of these terms is equally impossible, for like and unlike are
predicated in relation to quality, and the divine is free from quality. We, on the contrary,
confess identity of nature and accepting the consubstantiality, and rejecting the composition
of the Father, God in substance, Who begat the Son, God in substance. From this the consubstantiality1789
is proved. For God in essence or substance is co-essential or con-substantial
with God in essence or substance. But when even man is called “god” as in the words, “I
have said ye are gods,”1790 and “dæmon” as in the words, “The gods of the nations are dæmons,”
1791 in the former case the name is given by favour, in the latter untruly. God alone
is substantially and essentially God. When I say “alone” I set forth the holy and uncreated
essence and substance of God. For the word “alone” is used in the case of any individual
and generally of human nature. In the case of an individual, as for instance of Paul, that he
alone was caught into the third heaven and “heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful
for a man to utter,”1792 and of human nature, as when David says, “as for man his days are
as grass,”1793 not meaning any particular man, but human nature generally; for every man
is short-lived and mortal. So we understand these words to be said of the nature, “who alone
hath immortality”1794 and “to God only wise,”1795 and “none is good save one, that is
God,”1796 for here “one” means the same as alone. So also, “which alone spreadest out the
heavens,”1797 and again “Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou

gods falsely so called. As for instance, “The Lord alone did lead them and there was no
strange god with them,”1800 and “then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and
Ashtaroth, and did serve the Lord only.”1801 And so St. Paul, “For as there be gods many
and lords many, but to us there is but one god, the Father, of whom are all things; and one
Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are all things.”1802 Here we enquire why when he had said
“one God” he was not content, for we have said that “one” and “only” when applied to God,
indicate nature. Why did he add the word Father and make mention of Christ? Paul, a
chosen vessel, did not, I imagine, think it sufficient only to preach that the Son is God and
the Holy Ghost God, which he had expressed by the phrase “one God,” without, by the
further addition of “the Father,” expressing Him of Whom are all things; and, by mentioning
the Lord, signifying the Word by Whom are all things; and yet further, by adding the words
Jesus Christ, announcing the incarnation, setting forth the passion and publishing the resurrection.
For the word Jesus Christ suggests all these ideas to us. For this reason too before
His passion our Lord deprecates the designation of “Jesus Christ,” and charges His disciples
to “tell no man that He was Jesus, the Christ.”1803 For His purpose was, after the completion
of the oeconomy,1804 after His resurrection from the dead, and His assumption into heaven,
to commit to them the preaching of Him as Jesus, the Christ. Such is the force of the words
“That they may know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent,”1805
and again “Ye believe in God, believe also in me.”1806 Everywhere the Holy Ghost secures
our conception of Him to save us from falling in one direction while we advance in the
other, heeding the theology but neglecting the oeconomy,1807 and so by omission falling
into impiety.</p>
<p>4. Now let us examine, and to the best of our ability explain, the meaning of the words
of Holy Scripture, which our opponents seize and wrest to their own sense, and urge against
us for the destruction of the glory of the Only-begotten. First of all take the words “I live
because of the Father,”1808 for this is one of the shafts hurled heavenward by those who

impiously use it. These words I do not understand to refer to the eternal life; for whatever
lives because of something else cannot be self-existent, just as that which is warmed by another
cannot be warmth itself; but He Who is our Christ and God says, “I am the life.”1809
I understand the life lived because of the Father to be this life in the flesh, and in this time.
Of His own will He came to live the life of men. He did not say “I have lived because of the
Father,” but “I live because of the Father,” clearly indicating the present time, and the Christ,
having the word of God in Himself, is able to call the life which He leads, life, and that this
is His meaning we shall learn from what follows. “He that eateth me,” He says, “he also
shall live because of me;”1810 for we eat His flesh, and drink His blood, being made through
His incarnation and His visible life partakers of His Word and of His Wisdom. For all His
mystic sojourn among us He called flesh and blood, and set forth the teaching consisting
of practical science, of physics, and of theology, whereby our soul is nourished and is
meanwhile trained for the contemplation of actual realities. This is perhaps the intended
meaning of what He says.1811</p>
<p>5. And again, “My Father is greater than I.”1812 This passage is also employed by the
ungrateful creatures, the brood of the evil one. I believe that even from this passage the
consubstantiality of the Son with the Father is set forth. For I know that comparisons may
properly be made between things which are of the same nature. We speak of angel as
greater than angel, of man as juster than man, of bird as fleeter than bird. If then comparisons
are made between things of the same species, and the Father by comparison is said to be
greater than the Son, then the Son is of the same substance as the Father. But there is another
sense underlying the expression. In what is it extraordinary that He who “is the Word and
was made flesh”1813 confesses His Father to be greater than Himself, when He was seen in
glory inferior to the angels, and in form to men? For “Thou hast made him a little lower
than the angels,”1814 and again “Who was made a little lower than the angels,”1815 and “we

saw Him and He had neither form nor comeliness, his form was deficient beyond all
men.”1816 All this He endured on account of His abundant loving kindness towards His
work, that He might save the lost sheep and bring it home when He had saved it, and bring
back safe and sound to his own land the man who went down from Jerusalem to Jericho
and so fell among thieves.1817 Will the heretic cast in His teeth the manger out of which
he in his unreasonableness was fed by the Word of reason? Will he, because the carpenter’s
son had no bed to lie on, complain of His being poor? This is why the Son is less than the
Father; for your sakes He was made dead to free you from death and make you sharer in
heavenly life. It is just as though any one were to find fault with the physician for stooping
to sickness, and breathing its foul breath, that he may heal the sick.</p>
<p>6. It is on thy account that He knows not the hour and the day of judgment. Yet
nothing is beyond the ken of the real Wisdom, for “all things were made by Him;”1818 and
even among men no one is ignorant of what he has made. But this is His dispensation1819
because of thine own infirmity, that sinners be not plunged into despair by the narrow
limits of the appointed period,1820 no opportunity for repentance being left them; and that,
on the other hand, those who are waging a long war with the forces of the enemy may not
desert their post on account of the protracted time. For both of these classes He arranges1821
by means of His assumed ignorance; for the former cutting the time short for their glorious
struggle’s sake; for the latter providing an opportunity for repentance because of their sins.
In the gospels He numbered Himself among the ignorant, on account, as I have said, of the
infirmity of the greater part of mankind. In the Acts of the Apostles, speaking, as it were,
to the perfect apart, He says, “It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the
Father hath put in His own power.”1822 Here He implicitly excepts Himself. So much for
a rough statement by way of preliminary attack. Now let us enquire into the meaning of
the text from a higher point of view. Let me knock at the door of knowledge, if haply I may
wake the Master of the house, Who gives the spiritual bread to them who ask Him, since

<p>7. Our Saviour’s holy disciples, after getting beyond the limits of human thought, and
then being purified by the word,1823 are enquiring about the end, and longing to know the
ultimate blessedness which our Lord declared to be unknown to His angels and to Himself.
He calls all the exact comprehension of the purposes of God, a day; and the contemplation
of the One-ness and Unity, knowledge of which He attributes to the Father alone, an hour.
I apprehend, therefore, that God is said to know of Himself what is; and not to know what
is not; God, Who is, of His own nature, very righteousness and wisdom, is said to know
righteousness and wisdom; but to be ignorant of unrighteousness and wickedness; for God
who created us is not unrighteousness and wickedness. If, then, God is said to know about
Himself that which is, and not to know that which is not; and if our Lord, according to the
purpose of the Incarnation and the denser doctrine, is not the ultimate object of desire; then
our Saviour does not know the end and the ultimate blessedness. But He says the angels do
not know;1824 that is to say, not even the contemplation which is in them, nor the methods
of their ministries are the ultimate object of desire. For even their knowledge, when compared
with the knowledge which is face to face, is dense.1825 Only the Father, He says, knows,
since He is Himself the end and the ultimate blessedness, for when we no longer know God
in mirrors and not immediately,1826 but approach Him as one and alone, then we shall
know even the ultimate end. For all material knowledge is said to be the kingdom of Christ;
while immaterial knowledge, and so to say the knowledge of actual Godhead, is that of God
the Father. But our Lord is also Himself the end and the ultimate blessedness according to
the purpose of the Word; for what does He say in the Gospel? “I will raise him up at the
last day.”1827 He calls the transition from material knowledge to immaterial contemplation
a resurrection, speaking of that knowledge after which there is no other, as the last day: for
our intelligence is raised up and roused to a height of blessedness at the time when it con-

templates the One-ness and Unity of the Word. But since our intelligence is made dense
and bound to earth, it is both commingled with clay and incapable of gazing intently in pure
contemplation, being led through adornments1828 cognate to its own body. It considers
the operations of the Creator, and judges of them meanwhile by their effects, to the end that
growing little by little it may one day wax strong enough to approach even the actual unveiled
Godhead. This is the meaning, I think, of the words “my Father is greater than I,”1829 and
also of the statement, “It is not mine to give save to those for whom it is prepared by my
Father.”1830 This too is what is meant by Christ’s “delivering up the kingdom to God even
the Father;”1831 inasmuch as according to the denser doctrine which, as I said, is regarded
relatively to us and not to the Son Himself, He is not the end but the first fruits. It is in accordance
with this view that when His disciples asked Him again in the Acts of the Apostles,
“When wilt thou restore the kingdom of Israel?” He replied, “It is not for you to know the
times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power.”1832 That is to say, the
knowledge of such a kingdom is not for them that are bound in flesh and blood. This contemplation
the Father hath put away in His own power, meaning by “power” those that are
empowered, and by “His own” those who are not held down by the ignorance of things below.
Do not, I beg you, have in mind times and seasons of sense but certain distinctions of
knowledge made by the sun apprehended by mental perception. For our Lord’s prayer must
be carried out. It is Jesus Who prayed “Grant that they may be one in us as I and Thou are
one, Father.”1833 For when God, Who is one, is in each, He makes all out; and number is
lost in the in-dwelling of Unity.</p>

He is named “Beginning of ways”1835 of good news, which lead us to the kingdom of heaven.
He is not in essence and substance a creature, but is made a “way” according to the oeconomy.
Being made and being created signify the same thing. As He was made a way, so was He
made a door, a shepherd, an angel, a sheep, and again a High Priest and an Apostle,1836 the
names being used in other senses. What again would the heretics say about God unsubjected,
and about His being made sin for us?1837 For it is written “But when all things shall be

(ἀπό) the Father, in this respect the Father is greater, as cause and origin (ὡς αἴτιος καὶ ἀρχή). Whence also
the Lord said thus my Father is greater than I, clearly inasmuch as He is Father (καθὸ πατήρ). Yea; what else
does the word Father signify unless the being cause and origin of that which is begotten by Him?” And in iii.
1: “The Son is second in order (τάξει) to the Father, because He is from Him (ἀπό) and in dignity (ἀξιώματι)
because the Father is the origin and cause of His being.” Quoted by Bp. Westcott in his St. John in the additional
notes on xiv. 16, 28, pp. 211 seqq., where also will be found quotations from other Fathers on this passage.</note>
<note type="footnote">1835 The text of Prov. viii. 22 in the LXX. is κύριος ἔκτισέ με ἀρχὴν ὁδῶν αὐτοῦ εἰς ἔργα αὐτοῦ. The rendering
of A.V. is “possessed,” with “formed” in the margin. The Hebrew verb occurs some eighty times in the Old
Testament, and in only four other passages is translated by possess, viz., Gen. xiv. 19, 22, Ps. cxxxix. 13, Jer.
xxxii. 15, and Zec. xi. 5. In the two former, though the LXX. renders the word in the Psalms ἐκτήσω, it would
have borne the sense of “create.” In the passage under discussion the Syriac agrees with the LXX., and among
critics adopting the same view Bishop Wordsworth cites Ewald, Hitzig, and Genesius. The ordinary meaning
of the Hebrew is “get” or “acquire,” and hence it is easy to see how the idea of getting or possessing passed in
relation to the Creator into that of creation. The Greek translators were not unanimous and Aquila wrote
ἐκτήσατο. The passage inevitably became the Jezreel or Low Countries of the Arian war, and many a battle was
fought on it. The depreciators of the Son found in it Scriptural authority for calling Him κτίσμα, e.g. Arius in
the Thalia, is quoted by Athanasius in Or. c. Ar. I. iii. § 9, and such writings of his followers as the Letter of Eusebius
of Nicomedia to Paulinus of Tyre cited in Theod., Ecc. Hist. I. v., and Eunomius as quoted by Greg. Nyss.,
c. Eunom. II. 10; but as Dr. Liddon observes in his Bampton Lect. (p. 60, ed. 1868), “They did not doubt that this
created Wisdom was a real being or person.” ἔκτισεwas accepted by the Catholic writers, but explained to refer
to the manhood only, cf. Eustathius of Antioch, quoted in Theod., Dial. I. The view of Athanasius will be found
in his dissertation on the subject in the Second Discourse against the Arians, pp. 357–385 of Schaff U+0026 Wace’s

under Him.”1838 Are you not afraid, sir, of God called unsubjected? For He makes thy
subjection His own; and because of thy struggling against goodness He calls himself unsubjected.
In this sense too He once spoke of Himself as persecuted—“Saul, Saul,” He says,
“why persecutest thou me?”1839 on the occasion when Saul was hurrying to Damascus with
a desire to imprison the disciples. Again He calls Himself naked, when any one of his
brethren is naked. “I was naked,” He says, “and ye clothed me;”1840 and so when another
is in prison He speaks of Himself as imprisoned, for He Himself took away our sins and
bare our sicknesses.1841 Now one of our infirmities is not being subject, and He bare this.
So all the things which happen to us to our hurt He makes His own, taking upon Him our
sufferings in His fellowship with us.</p>
<p>9. But another passage is also seized by those who are fighting against God to the perversion
of their hearers: I mean the words “The Son can do nothing of Himself.”1842 To
me this saying too seems distinctly declaratory of the Son’s being of the same nature as the
Father. For if every rational creature is able to do anything of himself, and the inclination
which each has to the worse and to the better is in his own power, but the Son can do
nothing of Himself, then the Son is not a creature. And if He is not a creature, then He is
of one essence and substance with the Father. Again; no creature can do what he likes. But
the Son does what He wills in heaven and in earth. Therefore the Son is not a creature.
Again; all creatures are either constituted of contraries or receptive of contraries. But the
Son is very righteousness, and immaterial. Therefore the Son is not a creature, and if He is
not a creature, He is of one essence and substance with the Father.</p>
<p>10. This examination of the passages before us is, so far as my ability goes, sufficient.
Now let us turn the discussion on those who attack the Holy Spirit, and cast down every
high thing of their intellect that exalts itself against the knowledge of God.1843 You say that
the Holy Ghost is a creature. And every creature is a servant of the Creator, for “all are thy
servants.”1844 If then He is a servant, His holiness is acquired; and everything of which the
holiness is acquired is receptive of evil; but the Holy Ghost being holy in essence is called
“fount of holiness.”1845 Therefore the Holy Ghost is not a creature. If He is not a creature,

He is of one essence and substance with the Father. How, tell me, can you give the name
of servant to Him Who through your baptism frees you from your servitude? “The law,” it
is said, “of the Spirit of life hath made me free from the law of sin.”1846 But you will never
venture to call His nature even variable, so long as you have regard to the nature of the op-
posing power of the enemy, which, like lightning, is fallen from heaven and fell out of the
true life because its holiness was acquired, and its evil counsels were followed by its change.
So when it had fallen away from the Unity and had cast from it its angelic dignity, it was
named after its character “Devil,”1847 its former and blessed condition being extinct and
this hostile power being kindled.</p>
<p>Furthermore if he calls the Holy Ghost a creature he describes His nature as limited.
How then can the two following passages stand? “The Spirit of the Lord filleth the world;”1848
and “Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?”1849 But he does not, it would seem, confess Him
to be simple in nature; for he describes Him as one in number. And, as I have already said,
everything that is one in number is not simple. And if the Holy Spirit is not simple, He
consists of essence and sanctification, and is therefore composite. But who is mad enough
to describe the Holy Spirit as composite, and not simple, and consubstantial with the Father
and the Son?</p>
<p>11. If we ought to advance our argument yet further, and turn our inspection to higher
themes, let us contemplate the divine nature of the Holy Spirit specially from the following
point of view. In Scripture we find mention of three creations. The first is the evolution
from non-being into being.1850 The second is change from the worse to the better. The
third is the resurrection of the dead. In these you will find the Holy Ghost cooperating with
the Father and the Son. There is a bringing into existence of the heavens; and what says
David? “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the
breath of His mouth.”1851 Again, man is created through baptism, for “if any man be in
Christ he is a new creature.”1852 And why does the Saviour say to the disciples, “Go ye

therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost”? Here too you see the Holy Ghost present with the Father and the
Son. And what would you say also as to the resurrection of the dead when we shall have
failed and returned to our dust? Dust we are and unto dust we shall return.1853 And He
will send the Holy Ghost and create us and renew the face of the earth.1854 For what the
holy Paul calls resurrection David describes as renewal. Let us hear, once more, him who
was caught into the third heaven. What does he say? “You are the temple of the Holy Ghost
which is in you.”1855 Now every temple1856 is a temple of God, and if we are a temple of
the Holy Ghost, then the Holy Ghost is God. It is also called Solomon’s temple, but this is
in the sense of his being its builder. And if we are a temple of the Holy Ghost in this sense,
then the Holy Ghost is God, for “He that built all things is God.”1857 If we are a temple of
one who is worshipped, and who dwells in us, let us confess Him to be God, for thou shalt
worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.1858 Supposing them to object
to the word “God,” let them learn what this word means. God is called Θεὸς either because
He placed (τεθεικέναι) all things or because He beholds (Θεᾶσθαι) all things. If He is called
Θεὸς because He “placed” or “beholds” all things, and the Spirit knoweth all the things of
God, as the Spirit in us knoweth our things, then the Holy Ghost is God.1859 Again, if the
sword of the spirit is the word of God,1860 then the Holy Ghost is God, inasmuch as the
sword belongs to Him of whom it is also called the word. Is He named the right hand of
the Father? For “the right hand of the Lord bringeth mighty things to pass;”1861 and “thy
right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.”1862 But the Holy Ghost is the finger
of God, as it is said “if I by the finger of God cast out devils,”1863 of which the version in
another Gospel is “if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils.”1864 So the Holy Ghost is of the
same nature as the Father and the Son.</p>

<p>12. So much must suffice for the present on the subject of the adorable and holy Trinity.
It is not now possible to extend the enquiry about it further. Do ye take seeds from a humble
person like me, and cultivate the ripe ear for yourselves, for, as you know, in such cases we
look for interest. But I trust in God that you, because of your pure lives, will bring forth
fruit thirty, sixty, and a hundred fold. For, it is said, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
shall see God.1865 And, my brethren, entertain no other conception of the kingdom of the
heavens than that it is the very contemplation of realities. This the divine Scriptures call
blessedness. For “the kingdom of heaven is within you.”1866</p>
<p>The inner man consists of nothing but contemplation. The kingdom of the heavens,
then, must be contemplation. Now we behold their shadows as in a glass; hereafter, set free
from this earthly body, clad in the incorruptible and the immortal, we shall behold their
archetypes, we shall see them, that is, if we have steered our own life’s course aright, and if
we have heeded the right faith, for otherwise none shall see the Lord. For, it is said, into a
malicious soul Wisdom shall not enter, nor dwell in the body that is subject unto sin.1867
And let no one urge in objection that, while I am ignoring what is before our eyes, I am
philosophizing to them about bodiless and immaterial being. It seems to me perfectly absurd,
while the senses are allowed free action in relation to their proper matter, to exclude mind
alone from its peculiar operation. Precisely in the same manner in which sense touches
sensible objects, so mind apprehends the objects of mental perception. This too must be
said that God our Creator has not included natural faculties among things which can be
taught. No one teaches sight to apprehend colour or form, nor hearing to apprehend sound
and speech, nor smell, pleasant and unpleasant scents, nor taste, flavours and savours, nor
touch, soft and hard, hot and cold. Nor would any one teach the mind to reach objects of
mental perception; and just as the senses in the case of their being in any way diseased, or
injured, require only proper treatment and then readily fulfil their own functions; just so
the mind, imprisoned in flesh, and full of the thoughts that arise thence, requires faith and
right conversation which make “its feet like hinds’ feet, and set it on its high places.”1868
The same advice is given us by Solomon the wise, who in one passage offers us the example

Alford, who quotes Xen., Anab. I. x. 3 for the Greek, Bp. Walsham How, Bornemann, Meyer. The older view
coincided with that of Basil; so Theophylact, Chrysostom, and with them Olshausen and Godet. To the objection
that the words were said to the Pharisees, and that the kingdom was not in their hearts, it may be answered that
our Lord might use “you” of humanity, even when addressing Pharisees. He never, like a merely human
preacher, says “we.”</note>

<head>To Maximus the Philosopher.</head>
<p>1. Speech is really an image of mind: so I have learned to know you from your letters,
just as the proverb tells us we may know “the lion from his claws.”1873</p>
<p>I am delighted to find that your strong inclinations lie in the direction of the first and
greatest of good things—love both to God and to your neighbour. Of the latter I find proof
in your kindness to myself; of the former, in your zeal for knowledge. It is well known to
every disciple of Christ that in these two all is contained.</p>
<p>2. You ask for the writings of Dionysius;1874 they did indeed reach me, and a great
many they were; but I have not the books with me, and so have not sent them. My opinion
is, however, as follows. I do not admire everything that is written; indeed of some things I
totally disapprove. For it may be, that of the impiety of which we are now hearing so much,
I mean the Anomoean, it is he, as far as I know, who first gave men the seeds. I do not trace
his so doing to any mental depravity, but only to his earnest desire to resist Sabellius. I often
compare him to a woodman trying to straighten some ill-grown sapling, pulling so immoderately
in the opposite direction as to exceed the mean, and so dragging the plant awry on
the other side. This is very much what we find to be the case with Dionysius. While vehe
mently opposing the impiety of the Libyan,1875 he is carried away unawares by his zeal into
the opposite error. It would have been quite sufficient for him to have pointed out that the
Father and the Son are not identical in substance,1876 and thus to score against the blasphemer.
But, in order to win an unmistakable and superabundant victory, he is not satisfied
with laying down a difference of hypostases, but must needs assert also difference of sub-

stance, diminution of power, and variableness of glory. So he exchanges one mischief for
another, and diverges from the right line of doctrine. In his writings he exhibits a miscellaneous
inconsistency, and is at one time to be found disloyal to the homoousion, because
of his opponent1877 who made a bad use of it to the destruction of the hypostases, and at
another admitting it in his Apology to his namesake.1878 Besides this he uttered very unbecoming
words about the Spirit, separating Him from the Godhead, the object of worship,
and assigning Him an inferior rank with created and subordinate nature. Such is the man’s
character.</p>
<p>3. If I must give my own view, it is this. The phrase “like in essence,”1879 if it be read
with the addition “without any difference,”1880 I accept as conveying the same sense as the
homoousion, in accordance with the sound meaning of the homoousion. Being of this mind
the Fathers at Nicæa spoke of the Only-begotten as “Light of Light,” “Very God of very
God,” and so on, and then consistently added the homoousion. It is impossible for any one
to entertain the idea of variableness of light in relation to light, of truth in relation to truth,
nor of the essence of the Only begotten in relation to that of the Father. If, then, the phrase
be accepted in this sense, I have no objection to it. But if any one cuts off the qualification
“without any difference” from the word “like,” as was done at Constantinople,1881 then I
regard the phrase with suspicion, as derogatory to the dignity of the Only-begotten. We
are frequently accustomed to entertain the idea of “likeness” in the case of indistinct resemblances,
coming anything but close to the originals. I am myself for the homoousion, as being
less open to improper interpretation. But why, my dear sir, should you not pay me a visit,
that we may talk of these high topics face to face, instead of committing them to lifeless letters,—
especially when I have determined not to publish my views? And pray do not adopt,
to me, the words of Diogenes to Alexander, that “it is as far from you to me as from me to
you.” I am almost obliged by ill-health to remain like the plants, in one place; moreover I
hold “the living unknown”1882 to be one of the chief goods. You, I am told, are in good

the fragrance, and settle in the house. But why do I begin my letter thus? Because I have

of Christians as to the character of their names ceased, and after the fourth century heathen names were discouraged.
cf. D.C.A. ii. 1368. “Dionysius,” though of pagan origin, is biblical; but “martyrs often encountered death

<p>My brother Gregory writes me word that he has long been wishing to be with me, and

considering I have been so often disappointed, and partly because I find myself pulled all
ways by business. I must at once make for Pontus, where, perhaps, God willing, I may make
an end of wandering. After renouncing, with trouble, the idle hopes which I once had,
<del>about you</del>1893 or rather the dreams, (for it is well said that hopes are waking dreams), I
departed into Pontus in quest of a place to live in. There God has opened on me a spot exactly
answering to my taste, so that I actually see before my eyes what I have often pictured to
my mind in idle fancy. There is a lofty mountain covered with thick woods, watered towards
the north with cool and transparent streams. A plain lies beneath, enriched by the waters
which are ever draining off from it; and skirted by a spontaneous profusion of trees almost
thick enough to be a fence; so as even to surpass Calypso’s Island, which Homer seems to
have considered the most beautiful spot on the earth. Indeed it is like an island, enclosed
as it is on all sides; for deep hollows cut off two sides of it; the river, which has lately fallen
down a precipice, runs all along the front and is impassable as a wall; while the mountain
extending itself behind, and meeting the hollows in a crescent, stops up the path at its roots.
There is but one pass, and I am master of it. Behind my abode there is another gorge, rising
into a ledge up above, so as to command the extent of the plains and the stream which
bounds it, which is not less beautiful, to my taste, than the Strymon as seen from Amphipolis.
1894 For while the latter flows leisurely, and swells into a lake almost, and is too still to
be a river, the former is the most rapid stream I know, and somewhat turbid, too, from the
rocks just above; from which, shooting down, and eddying in a deep pool, it forms a most
pleasant scene for myself or any one else; and is an inexhaustible resource to the country
people, in the countless fish which its depths contain. What need to tell of the exhalations
from the earth, or the breezes from the river? Another might admire the multitude of
flowers, and singing birds; but leisure I have none for such thoughts. However, the chief
praise of the place is, that being happily disposed for produce of every kind, it nurtures what
to me is the sweetest produce of all, quietness; indeed, it is not only rid of the bustle of the

Is its body connected by sinews and ligaments? Are its sinews surrounded with muscles
and glands? Does its marrow go with dorsal vertebræ from brow to tail? Does it give impulse
to its moving members by the enveloping nervous membrane? Has it a liver, with a gall
bladder near the liver? Has it kidneys, heart, arteries, veins, membranes, cartilages? Is it
hairy or hairless? Has it an uncloven hoof, or are its feet divided? How long does it live?
What is its mode of reproduction? What is its period of gestation? How is it that ants
neither all walk nor all fly, but some belong to creeping things, and some travel through the
air? The man who glories in his knowledge of the really-existing ought to tell us in the
meanwhile about the nature of the ant. Next let him give us a similar physiological account
of the power that transcends all human intelligence. But if your knowledge has not yet been
able to apprehend the nature of the insignificant ant, how can you boast yourself able to
form a conception of the power of the incomprehensible God?1902</p>

<note type="footnote">1901 Eunomius the Anomoean, bp. of Cyzicus, against whose Liber Apologeticus Basil wrote his counter-work.
The first appearance of the αἱρετικὸς ἄνθρωπος, the “chooser” of his own way rather than the common sense
of the Church, is in Tit. iii. 10. αἱρετίζειν is a common word in the LXX., but does not occur in Is. xlii. 1, though
it is introduced into the quotation in Matt. xii. 18. ἅιρεσις is used six times by St. Luke for “sect;” twice by St.
Paul and once by St. Peter for “heresy.” Augustine, C. Manich. writes: “Qui in ecclesia Christi morbidum aliquid
pravumque quid sapiunt, si, correcti ut sanum rectumque sapiant, resistunt contumaciter suaque pestifera et
mortifera dogmata emendare nolunt, sed defensare persistunt hæretici sunt.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1902 As an argument against Eunomius this Letter has no particular force, inasmuch as a man may be a good
divine though a very poor entomologist, and might tell us all about the ant without being better able to decide
between Basil and Eunomius. It is interesting, however, as shewing how far Basil was abreast of the physiology
of his time, and how far that physiology was correct.</note>

<p>It is delightful to listen to you, and delightful to read you; and I think you give me the
greater pleasure by your writings. All thanks to our good God Who has not suffered the
truth to suffer in consequence of its betrayal by the chief powers in the State, but by your
means has made the defence of the doctrine of true religion full and satisfactory. Like
hemlock, monkshood, and other poisonous herbs, after they have bloomed for a little while,
they will quickly wither away. But the reward which the Lord will give you in requital of all
that you have said in defence of His name blooms afresh for ever. Wherefore I pray God
grant you all happiness in your home, and make His blessing descend to your sons. I was

and my prayers for them ask all that their father can ask.</p>

<p>The labours of the field come as no novelty to tillers of the land; sailors are not astonished
if they meet a storm at sea; sweats in the summer heat are the common experience of the
hired hind; and to them that have chosen to live a holy life the afflictions of this present
world cannot come unforeseen. Each and all of these have the known and proper labour
of their callings, not chosen for its own sake, but for the sake of the enjoyment of the good
things to which they look forward. What in each of these cases acts as a consolation in
trouble is that which really forms the bond and link of all human life,—hope. Now of them
that labour for the fruits of the earth, or for earthly things, some enjoy only in imagination
what they have looked for, and are altogether disappointed; and even in the case of others,
where the issue has answered expectation, another hope is soon needed, so quickly has the
first fled and faded out of sight. Only of them that labour for holiness and truth are the
hopes destroyed by no deception; no issue can destroy their labours, for the kingdom of the
heavens that awaits them is firm and sure. So long then as the word of truth is on our side,
never be in any wise distressed at the calumny of a lie; let no imperial threats scare you; do
not be grieved at the laughter and mockery of your intimates, nor at the condemnation of
those who pretend to care for you, and who put forward, as their most attractive bait to deceive,
a pretence of giving good advice. Against them all let sound reason do battle, invoking
the championship and succour of our Lord Jesus Christ, the teacher of true religion, for
Whom to suffer is sweet, and “to die is gain.”1907</p>

<head>To Leontius the Sophist.1911</head>
<p>I too do not write often to you, but not more seldom than you do to me, though many
have travelled hitherward from your part of the world. If you had sent a letter by every one
of them, one after the other, there would have been nothing to prevent my seeming to be
actually in your company, and enjoying it as though we had been together, so uninterrupted
has been the stream of arrivals. But why do you not write? It is no trouble to a Sophist to
write. Nay, if your hand is tired, you need not even write; another will do that for you. Only
your tongue is needed. And though it does not speak to me, it may assuredly speak to one
of your companions. If nobody is with you, it will talk by itself. Certainly the tongue of a
Sophist and of an Athenian is as little likely to be quiet as the nightingales when the spring
stirs them to song. In my own case, the mass of business in which I am now engaged may
perhaps afford some excuse for my lack of letters. And peradventure the fact of my style
having been spoilt by constant familiarity with common speech may make me somewhat
hesitate to address Sophists like you, who are certain to be annoyed and unmerciful, unless
you hear something worthy of your wisdom. You, on the other hand, ought assuredly to
use every opportunity of making your voice heard abroad, for you are the best speaker of
all the Hellenes that I know; and I think I know the most renowned among you; so that
there really is no excuse for your silence. But enough on this point.</p>
<p>I have sent you my writings against Eunomius. Whether they are to be called child’s
play, or something a little more serious, I leave you to judge. So far as concerns yourself, I
do not think you stand any longer in need of them; but I hope they will be no unworthy
weapon against any perverse men with whom you may fall in. I do not say this so much
because I have confidence in the force of my treatise, as because I know well that you are a
man likely to make a little go a long way. If anything strikes you as weaker than it ought to
be, pray have no hesitation in showing me the error. The chief difference between a friend
and a flatterer is this; the flatterer speaks to please, the friend will not leave out even what
is disagreeable.</p>

<head>Letter XXI.1912</head>
<head>To Leontius the Sophist.</head>
<p>The excellent Julianus1913 seems to get some good for his private affairs out of the
general condition of things. Everything nowadays is full of taxes demanded and called in,
and he too is vehemently dunned and indicted. Only it is a question not of arrears of rates
and taxes, but of letters. But how he comes to be a defaulter I do not know. He has always
paid a letter, and received a letter—as he has this. But possibly you have a preference for
the famous “four-times-as-much.”1914 For even the Pythagoreans were not so fond of their
Tetractys,1915 as these modern tax-collectors of their “four-times-as-much.” Yet perhaps
the fairer thing would have been just the opposite, that a Sophist like you, so very well furnished
with words, should be bound in pledge to me for “four-times-as-much.” But do not
suppose for a moment that I am writing all this out of ill-humour. I am only too pleased to
get even a scolding from you. The good and beautiful do everything, it is said, with the addition
of goodness and beauty.1916 Even grief and anger in them are becoming. At all events
any one would rather see his friend angry with him than any one else flattering him. Do
not then cease preferring charges like the last! The very charge will mean a letter; and
nothing can be more precious or delightful to me.</p>

<head>Without address. On the Perfection of the Life of Solitaries.</head>
<p>1. Many things are set forth by inspired Scripture as binding upon all who are anxious
to please God. But, for the present, I have only deemed it necessary to speak by way of brief
reminder concerning the questions which have recently been stirred among you, so far as
I have learnt from the study of inspired Scripture itself. I shall thus leave behind me detailed
evidence, easy of apprehension, for the information of industrious students, who in their
turn will be able to inform others. The Christian ought to be so minded as becomes his
heavenly calling,1918 and his life and conversation ought to be worthy of the Gospel of
Christ.1919 The Christian ought not to be of doubtful mind,1920 nor by anything drawn
away from the recollection of God and of His purposes and judgments. The Christian ought
in all things to become superior to the righteousness existing under the law, and neither
swear nor lie.1921 He ought not to speak evil;1922 to do violence;1923 to fight;1924 to avenge
himself;1925 to return evil for evil;1926 to be angry.1927 The Christian ought to be patient,1928
whatever he have to suffer, and to convict the wrong-doer in season,1929 not with the desire
of his own vindication, but of his brother’s reformation,1930 according to the commandment
of the Lord. The Christian ought not to say anything behind his brother’s back with the
object of calumniating him, for this is slander, even if what is said is true.1931 He ought to
turn away from the brother who speaks evil against him;1932 he ought not to indulge in

jesting;1933 he ought not to laugh nor even to suffer laugh makers.1934 He must not talk
idly, saying things which are of no service to the hearers nor to such usage as is necessary
and permitted us by God;1935 so that workers may do their best as far as possible to work
in silence; and that good words be suggested to them by those who are entrusted with the
duty of carefully dispensing the word to the building up of the faith, lest God’s Holy Spirit
be grieved. Any one who comes in ought not to be able, of his own free will, to accost or
speak to any of the brothers, before those to whom the responsibility of general discipline
is committed have approved of it as pleasing to God, with a view to the common good.1936
The Christian ought not to be enslaved by wine;1937 nor to be eager for flesh meat,1938 and
as a general rule ought not to be a lover of pleasure in eating or drinking,1939 “for every man
that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.”1940 The Christian ought to regard
all the things that are given him for his use, not as his to hold as his own or to lay up;1941
and, giving careful heed to all things as the Lord’s, not to overlook any of the things that are
being thrown aside and disregarded, should this be the case. No Christian ought to think
of himself as his own master, but each should rather so think and act as though given by
God to be slave to his like minded brethren;1942 but “every man in his own order.”1943</p>
<p>2. The Christian ought never to murmur1944 either in scarcity of necessities, or in toil
or labour, for the responsibility in these matters lies with such as have authority in them.
There never ought to be any clamour, or any behaviour or agitation by which anger is expressed,
1945 or diversion of mind from the full assurance of the presence of God.1946</p>

<p>The voice should be modulated; no one ought to answer another, or do anything, roughly
or contemptuously,1947 but in all things moderation1948 and respect should be shewn to
every one.1949 No wily glances of the eye are to be allowed, nor any behaviour or gestures
which grieve a brother and shew contempt.1950 Any display in cloak or shoes is to be
avoided; it is idle ostentation.1951 Cheap things ought to be used for bodily necessity; and
nothing ought to be spent beyond what is necessary, or for mere extravagance; this is a
misuse of our property. The Christian ought not to seek for honour, or claim precedence.1952
Every one ought to put all others before himself.1953 The Christian ought not to be unruly.
1954 He who is able to work ought not to eat the bread of idleness,1955 but even he who
is busied in deeds well done for the glory of Christ ought to force himself to the active discharge
of such work as he can do.1956 Every Christian, with the approval of his superiors,
ought so to do everything with reason and assurance, even down to actual eating and
drinking, as done to the glory of God.1957 The Christian ought not to change over from
one work to another without the approval of those who are appointed for the arrangement
of such matters; unless some unavoidable necessity suddenly summon any one to the relief
of the helpless. Every one ought to remain in his appointed post, not to go beyond his own

judge any one to be in need of aid. No one ought to be found going from one workshop to
another. Nothing ought to be done in rivalry or strife with any one.</p>

God, and with the object of converting the sinner.1962 He who is proved wrong or rebuked
ought to take it willingly, recognizing his own gain in being set right. When any one is being
accused, it is not right for another, before him or any one else, to contradict the accuser;
but if at any time the charge seems groundless to any one, he ought privately to enter into
discussion with the accuser, and either produce, or acquire, conviction. Every one ought,
as far as he is able, to conciliate one who has ground of complaint against him. No one
ought to cherish a grudge against the sinner who repents, but heartily to forgive him.1963
He who says that he has repented of a sin ought not only to be pricked with compunction
for his sin, but also to bring forth fruits worthy of repentance.1964 He who has been corrected
in first faults, and received pardon, if he sins again prepares for himself a judgment of wrath
worse than the former.1965 He, who after the first and second admonition1966 abides in his
fault, ought to be brought before the person in authority,1967 if haply after being rebuked
by more he may be ashamed.1968 If even thus he fail to be set right he is to be cut off from
the rest as one that maketh to offend, and regarded as a heathen and a publican,1969 for the
security of them that are obedient, according to the saying, When the impious fall the
righteous tremble.1970 He should be grieved over as a limb cut from the body. The sun
ought not to go down upon a brother’s wrath,1971 lest haply night come between brother
and brother, and make the charge stand in the day of judgment. A Christian ought not to
wait for an opportunity for his own amendment,1972 because there is no certainty about the
morrow; for many after many devices have not reached the morrow. He ought not to be
beguiled by over eating, whence come dreams in the night. He ought not to be distracted
by immoderate toil, nor overstep the bounds of sufficiency, as the apostle says, “Having
food and raiment let us be therewith content;”1973 unnecessary abundance gives appearance
of covetousness, and covetousness is condemned as idolatry.1974 A Christian ought not to

<p>A certain man, as he says, on condemning the vanity of this life, and perceiving that its
joys are ended here, since they only provide material for eternal fire and then quickly pass
away, has come to me with the desire of separating from this wicked and miserable life, of
abandoning the pleasures of the flesh, and of treading for the future a road which leads to
the mansions of the Lord. Now if he is sincerely firm in his truly blessed purpose, and has
in his soul the glorious and laudable passion, loving the Lord his God with all his heart, with
all his strength, and with all his mind, it is necessary for your reverence to show him the
difficulties and distresses of the strait and narrow way, and establish him in the hope of the
good things which are as yet unseen, but are laid up in promise for all that are worthy of
the Lord. I therefore write to entreat your incomparable perfection in Christ, if it be possible
to mould his character, and, without me, to bring about his renunciation according to what
is pleasing to God, and to see that he receive elementary instruction in accordance with
what has been decided by the Holy Fathers, and put forth by them in writing. See too that
he have put before him all things that are essential to ascetic discipline, and that so he may
be introduced to the life, after having accepted, of his own accord, the labours undergone
for religion’s sake, subjected himself to the Lord’s easy yoke, adopted a conversation in imitation
of Him Who for our sakes became poor1978 and took flesh, and may run without
fail to the prize of his high calling, and receive the approbation of the Lord. He is wishful
to receive here the crown of God’s loves, but I have put him off, because I wish, in conjunction
with your reverence, to anoint him for such struggles, and to appoint over him one of your
number whom he may select to be his trainer, training him nobly, and making him by his
constant and blessed care a tried wrestler, wounding and overthrowing the prince of the
darkness of this world, and the spiritual powers of iniquity, with whom, as the blessed
Apostle says, is “our wrestling.”1979 What I wish to do in conjunction with you, let your

to calumny, I am myself fully persuaded, and so too, I presume, is your excellency. Yet
not to give a handle by one’s own conduct, either to inquisitive critics of society, or to mischief
makers who lie in wait to catch us tripping, is not only possible, but is the special characteristic
of all who order their lives wisely and according to the rule of true religion. And do
not think me so simple and credulous as to accept depreciatory remarks from any one
without due investigation. I bear in mind the admonition of the Spirit, “Thou shalt not receive
a false report.”1982 But you, learned men, yourselves say that “The seen is significant
of the unseen.” I therefore beg;—(and pray do not take it ill if I seem to be speaking as
though I were giving a lesson; for “God has chosen the weak” and “despised things of the
world,”1983 and often by their means brings about the salvation of such as are being saved);
what I say and urge is this; that by word and deed we act with scrupulous attention to propriety,
and, in accordance with the apostolic precept, “give no offence in anything.”1984
The life of one who has toiled hard in the acquisition of knowledge, who has governed cities
and states, and who is jealous of the high character of his forefathers, ought to be an example
of high character itself. You ought not now to be exhibiting your disposition towards your
children in word only, as you have long exhibited its ever since you became a father; you
ought not only to shew that natural affection which is shewn by brutes, as you yourself have
said, and as experience shews. You ought to make your love go further, and be a love all
the more personal and voluntary in that you see your children worthy of a father’s prayers.
On this point I do not need to be convinced. The evidence of facts is enough. One thing,
however, I will say for truth’s sake, that it is not our brother Timotheus, the Chorepiscopus,
who has brought me word of what is noised abroad. For neither by word of mouth nor by
letter has he ever conveyed anything in the shape of slander, be it small or great. That I have
heard something I do not deny, but it is not Timotheus who accuses you. Yet while I hear
whatever I do, at least I will follow the example of Alexander, and will keep one ear clear
for the accused.1985</p>

<head>Letter XXV.1986</head>
<head>To Athanasius, bishop of Ancyra.1987</head>
<p>1. I have received intelligence from those who come to me from Ancyra, and they are
many and more than I can count, but they all agree in what they say, that you, a man very
dear to me, (how can I speak so as to give no offence?) do not mention me in very pleasant
terms, nor yet in such as your character would lead me to expect. I, however, learned long
ago the weakness of human nature, and its readiness to turn from one extreme to another;
and so, be well assured, nothing connected with it can astonish me, nor does any change
come quite unexpected. Therefore that my lot should have changed for the worse, and that
reproaches and insults should have arisen in the place of former respect, I do not make
much ado. But one thing does really strike me as astonishing and monstrous, and that is
that it should be you who have this mind about me, and go so far as to feel anger and indignation
against me, and, if the report of your hearers is to be believed, have already proceeded
to such extremities as to utter threats. At these threats, I will not deny, I really have laughed.
Truly I should have been but a boy to be frightened at such bugbears. But it does seem to
me alarming and distressing that you, who, as I have trusted, are preserved for the comfort
of the churches, a buttress of the truth where many fall away, and a seed of the ancient and
true love, should so far fall in with the present course of events as to be more influenced by
the calumny of the first man you come across than by your long knowledge of me, and,
without any proof, should be seduced into suspecting absurdities.</p>
<p>2. But, as I said, for the present I postpone the case. Would it have been too hard a
task, my dear sir, to discuss in a short letter, as between friend and friend, points which you
wish to raise; or, if you objected to entrusting such things to writing, to get me to come to
you? But if you could not help speaking out, and your uncontrollable anger allowed no
time for delay, at least you might have employed one of those about you who are naturally
adapted for dealing with confidential matters, as a means of communication with me. But
now, of all those who for one reason or another approach you, into whose ears has it not
been dinned that I am a writer and composer of certain “pests”? For this is the word which
those, who quote you word for word, say that you have used. The more I bring my mind
to bear upon the matter the more hopeless is my puzzle. This idea has struck me. Can any
heretic have grieved your orthodoxy, and driven you to the utterance of that word by

his episcopate under unfavorable auspices, but acquired a reputation for orthodoxy. cf. Greg. Nyss., Contra

malevolently putting my name to his own writings? For you, a man who has sustained great
and famous contests on behalf of the truth, could never have endured to inflict such an
outrage on what I am well known to have written against those who dare to say that God
the Son is in essence unlike God the Father, or who blasphemously describe the Holy Ghost
as created and made. You might relieve me from my difficulty yourself, if you would tell
me plainly what it is that has stirred you to be thus offended with me.</p>

<head>Letter XXVI.1988</head>
<head>To Cæsarius, brother of Gregory.1989</head>
<p>Thanks to God for shewing forth His wonderful power in your person, and for preserving
you to your country and to us your friends, from so terrible a death. It remains for us not
to be ungrateful, nor unworthy of so great a kindness, but, to the best of our ability, to narrate
the marvellous works of God, to celebrate by deed the kindness which we have experienced,
and not return thanks by word only. We ought to become in very deed what I, grounding
my belief on the miracles wrought in you, am persuaded that you now are. We exhort you
still more to serve God, ever increasing your fear more and more, and advancing on to
perfection, that we may be made wise stewards of our life, for which the goodness of God
has reserved us. For if it is a command to all of us “to yield ourselves unto God as those
that are alive from the dead,”1990 how much more strongly is not this commanded them
who have been lifted up from the gates of death? And this, I believe, would be best effected,
did we but desire ever to keep the same mind in which we were at the moment of our perils.
For, I ween, the vanity of our life came before us, and we felt that all that belongs to man,
exposed as it is to vicissitudes, has about it nothing sure, nothing firm. We felt, as was likely,
repentance for the past; and we gave a promise for the future, if we were saved, to serve God
and give careful heed to ourselves. If the imminent peril of death gave me any cause for
reflection, I think that you must have been moved by the same or nearly the same thoughts.
We are therefore bound to pay a binding debt, at once joyous at God’s good gift to us, and,
at the same time, anxious about the future. I have ventured to make these suggestions to
you. It is yours to receive what I say well and kindly, as you were wont to do when we talked
together face to face.</p>

<p>When by God’s grace, and the aid of your prayers, I had seemed to be somewhat recovering
from my sickness, and had got my strength again, then came winter, keeping me a
prisoner at home, and compelling me to remain where I was. True, its severity was much
less than usual, but this was quite enough to keep me not merely from travelling while it
lasted, but even from so much as venturing to put my head out of doors. But to me it is no
slight thing to be permitted, if only by letter, to communicate with your reverence, and to
rest tranquil in the hope of your reply. However, should the season permit, and further
length of life be allowed me, and should the dearth not prevent me from undertaking the
journey,1993 peradventure through the aid of your prayers I may be able to fulfil my earnest
wish, may find you at your own fireside, and, with abundant leisure, may take my fill of
your vast treasures of wisdom.</p>

<note type="footnote">1992 This, the first of twenty-two letters addressed by Basil to Eusebius of Samosata, has no particular interest.
Eusebius, the friend of Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus, and of Meletius, was bishop of Samosata (in Commagene
on the Euphrates, now Samsat) from 360 to 373, and was of high character and sound opinions. Theodoret
(Ecc. Hist. iv. 15), in mentioning his exile to Thrace in the persecution under Valens, calls him “that unflagging
labourer in apostolic work,” and speaks warmly of his zeal. Concerning the singular and touching circumstances
of his death, vide Theodoret, E.H. v. 4, and my note in the edition of this series, p. 134.</note>

<head>Letter XXVIII.1994</head>
<head>To the Church of Neocæsarea. Consolatory.1995</head>
<p>1. What has befallen you strongly moved me to visit you, with the double object of
joining with you, who are near and dear to me, in paying all respect to the blessed dead, and
of being more closely associated with you in your trouble by seeing your sorrow with my
own eyes, and so being able to take counsel with you as to what is to be done. But many
causes hinder my being able to approach you in person, and it remains for me to communicate
with you in writing. The admirable qualities of the departed, on account of which
we chiefly estimate the greatness of our loss, are indeed too many to be enumerated in a
letter; and it is, besides, no time to be discussing the multitude of his good deeds, when our
spirits are thus prostrated with grief. For of all that he did, what can we ever forget? What
could we deem deserving of silence? To tell all at once were impossible; to tell a part would,
I fear, involve disloyalty to the truth. A man has passed away who surpassed all his contemporaries
in all the good things that are within man’s reach; a prop of his country; an ornament
of the churches; a pillar and support of the truth; a stay of the faith of Christ; a protector of
his friends; a stout foe of his opponents; a guardian of the principles of his fathers; an enemy
of innovation; exhibiting in himself the ancient fashion of the Church, and making the state
of the Church put under him conform to the ancient constitution, as to a sacred model, so
that all who lived with him seemed to live in the society of them that used to shine like lights
in the world two hundred years ago and more. So your bishop put forth nothing of his own,
no novel invention; but, as the blessing of Moses has it, he knew how to bring out of the
secret and good stores of his heart, “old store, and the old because of the new.”1996 Thus it
came about that in meetings of his fellow bishops he was not ranked according to his age,
but, by reason of the old age of his wisdom, he was unanimously conceded precedence over
all the rest. And no one who looks at your condition need go far to seek the advantages of
such a course of training. For, so far as I know, you alone, or, at all events, you and but very
few others, in the midst of such a storm and whirlwind of affairs, were able under his good
guidance to live your lives unshaken by the waves. You were never reached by heretics’
buffering blasts, which bring shipwreck and drowning on unstable souls; and that you may

for ever live beyond their reach I pray the Lord who ruleth over all, and who granted long
tranquillity to Gregory His servant, the first founder of your church.1997</p>
<p>Do not lose that tranquillity now; do not, by extravagant lamentation, and by entirely
giving yourself up to grief, put the opportunity for action into the hands of those who are
plotting your bane. If lament you must, (which I do not allow, lest you be in this respect
like “them which have no hope,”)1998 do you, if so it seem good to you, like some wading
chorus, choose your leader, and raise with him a chant of tears.</p>
<p>2. And yet, if he whom you mourn had not reached extreme old age, certainly, as regards
his government of your church, he was allowed no narrow limit of life. He had as much
strength of body as enabled him to show strength of mind in his distresses. Perhaps some
of you may suppose that time increases sympathy and adds affection, and is no cause of
satiety, so that, the longer you have experienced kind treatment, the more sensible you are
of its loss. You may think that of a righteous person the good hold even the shadow in
honour. Would that many of you did feel so! Far be it from me to suggest anything like
disregard of our friend! But I do counsel you to bear your pain with manly endurance. I
myself am by no means insensible of all that may be said by those who are weeping for their
loss. Hushed is a tongue whose words flooded our ears like a mighty stream: a depth of
heart, never fathomed before, has fled, humanly speaking, like an unsubstantial dream.
Whose glance so keen as his to look into the future? Who with like fixity and strength of
mind able to dart like lightning into the midst of action? O Neocæsarea, already a prey to
many troubles, never before smitten with so deadly a loss! Now withered is the bloom of
you, beauty; your church is dumb; your assemblies are full of mournful faces; your sacred
synod craves for its leader; your holy utterances wait for an expounder; your boys have lost
a father, your elders a brother, your nobles one first among them, your people a champion,
your poor a supporter. All, calling him by the name that comes most nearly home to each,
lift up the wailing cry which to each man’s own sorrow seems most appropriate and fit. But
whither are my words carried away by my tearful joy? Shall we not watch? Shall we not
meet together? Shall we not look to our common Lord, Who suffers each of his saints to
serve his own generation, and summons him back to Himself at His own appointed time?
Now in season remember the voice of him who when preaching to you used always to say
“Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers.”1999 The dogs are many. Why do I say dogs?
Rather grievous wolves, hiding their guile under the guise of sheep, are, all over the world,
tearing Christ’s flock. Of these you must beware, under the protection of some wakeful
bishop. Such an one it is yours to ask, purging your souls of all rivalry and ambition: such

an one it is the Lord’s to show you. That Lord, from the time of Gregory the great champion
of your church down to that of the blessed departed, setting over you one after another, and
from time to time fitting one to another like gem set close to gem, has bestowed on you
glorious ornaments for your church. You have, then, no need to despair of them that are
to come. The Lord knoweth who are His. He may bring into our midst those for whom
peradventure we are not looking.</p>
<p>3. I meant to have come to an end long before this, but the pain at my heart does not
allow me. Now I charge you by the Fathers, by the true faith, by our blessed friend, lift up
your souls, each man making what is being done his own immediate business, each reckoning
that he will be the first to reap the consequences of the issue, whichever way it turn out, lest
your fate be that which so very frequently befalls, every one leaving to his neighbour the
common interests of all; and then, while each one makes little in his own mind of what is
going on, all of you unwittingly draw your own proper misfortunes on yourselves by your
neglect. Take, I beg you, what I say with all kindliness, whether it be regarded as an expression
of the sympathy of a neighbour, or as fellowship between fellow believers, or, which is
really nearer the truth, of one who obeys the law of love, and shrinks from the risk of silence.
I am persuaded that you are my boasting, as I am yours, till the day of the Lord, and that it
depends upon the pastor who will be granted you whether I shall be more closely united to
you by the bond of love, or wholly severed from you. This latter God forbid. By God’s grace
it will not so be; and I should be sorry now to say one ungracious word. But this I do wish
you to know, that though I had not that blessed man always at my side, in my efforts for the
peace of the churches, because, as he himself affirmed, of certain prejudices, yet, nevertheless,
at no time did I fail in unity of opinion with him, and I have always invoked his aid in my
struggles against the heretics. Of this I call to witness God and all who know me best.</p>

<head>Letter XXIX.2000</head>
<head>To the Church of Ancyra. Consolatory.2001h</head>
<p>My amazement at the most distressing news of the calamity which has befallen you for
a long time kept me silent. I felt like a man whose ears are stunned by a loud clap of thunder.
Then I somehow recovered a little from my state of speechlessness. Now I have mourned,
as none could help mourning, over the event, and, in the midst of my lamentations, have
sent you this letter. I write not so much to console you,—for who could find words to cure
a calamity so great?—as to signify to you, as well as I can by these means, the agony of my
own heart. I need now the lamentations of Jeremiah, or of any other of the Saints who has
feelingly lamented a great woe. A man has fallen who was really a pillar and stay of the
Church or rather he himself has been taken from us and is gone to the blessed life, and there
is no small danger lest many at the removal of this prop from under them fall too, and lest
some men’s unsoundness be brought to light. A mouth is sealed gushing with righteous
eloquence and words of grace to the edification of the brotherhood. Gone are the counsels
of a mind which truly moved in God. Ah! how often, for I must accuse myself, was it my
lot to feel indignation against him, because, wholly desiring to depart and be with Christ,
he did not prefer for our sakes to remain in the flesh!2002 To whom for the future shall I
commit the cares of the Churches? Whom shall I take to share my troubles? Whom to
participate in my gladness? O loneliness terrible and sad! How am I not like to a pelican
of the wilderness?2003 Yet of a truth the members of the Church, united by his leadership
as by one soul, and fitted together into close union of feeling and fellowship, are both preserved
and shall ever be preserved by the bond of peace for spiritual communion. God
grants us the boon, that all the works of that blessed soul, which he did nobly in the churches
of God, abide firm and immovable. But the struggle is no slight one, lest, once more strifes
and divisions arising over the choice of the bishop, all your work be upset by some quarrel.</p>

Mother,2005 the only comfort I had in life. Do not smile, if, old as I am, I lament my
orphanhood. Forgive me if I cannot endure separation from a soul, to compare with whom
I see nothing in the future that lies before me. So once more my complaints have come back
to me; once more I am confined to my bed, tossing about in my weakness, and every hour
all but looking for the end of life; and the Churches are in somewhat the same condition as
my body, no good hope shining on them, and their state always changing for the worse. In
the meantime Neocæsarea and Ancyra have decided to have successors of the dead, and so
far they are at peace. Those who are plotting against me have not yet been permitted to do
anything worthy of their bitterness and wrath. This we make no secret of attributing to

Receive my entreaty that you will give him the usual protection alike for your own sake, for

<p>Our God—beloved brother, Gregory the bishop,2010 shares the troubles of the times,
for he too, like everybody else, is distressed at successive outrages, and resembles a man
buffeted by unexpected blows. For men who have no fear of God, possibly forced by the
greatness of their troubles, are reviling him, on the ground that they have lent Cæsarius2011
money. It is not indeed the question of any loss which is serious, for he has long learnt to
despise riches. The matter rather is that those who have so freely distributed all the effects
of Cæsarius that were worth anything, after really getting very little, because his property
was in the hands of slaves, and of men of no better character than slaves, did not leave much
for the executors.2012 This little they supposed to be pledged to no one, and straightway
spent it on the poor, not only from their own preference, but because of the injunctions of
the dead. For on his death bed Cæsarius is declared to have said “I wish my goods to belong
to the poor.” In obedience then to the wishes of Cæsarius they made a proper distribution
of them. Now, with the poverty of a Christian, Gregory is immersed in the bustle of a
chafferer. So I bethought me of reporting the matter to your excellency, in order that you
may state what you think proper about Gregory to the Comes Thesaurorum, and so may
honour a man whom you have known for many years, glorify the Lord who takes as done
to Himself what is done to His servants, and honour me who am specially bound to you.
You will, I hope, of your great sagacity devise a means of relief from these outrageous people
and intolerable annoyances.</p>

Your excellency may be informed that, so long as it was possible, no one went away without
getting what he wanted, and each one carried off what he demanded without any difficulty.
The consequence indeed was that a good many were sorry that they had not asked for more
at first; and this made still more objectors, for with the example of the earlier successful
applicants before them, one false claimant starts up after another. I do then entreat your
excellency to make a stand against all this and to come in, like some intervening stream,

<p>Who knows so well as you do how to respect an old friendship, to pay reverence to virtue,
and to sympathise with the sick? Now my God-beloved brother Gregory the bishop has
become involved in matters which would be under any circumstances disagreeable, and are
quite foreign to his bent of mind. I have therefore thought it best to throw myself on your
protection, and to endeavour to obtain from you some solution of our difficulties. It is really
an intolerable state of things that one who is neither by nature nor inclination adapted for
anything of the kind should be compelled to be thus responsible; that demands for money
should be made on a poor man; and that one who has long determined to pass his life in
retirement should be dragged into publicity. It would depend upon your wise counsel
whether you think it of any use to address the Comes Thesaurorum or any other persons.</p>

Tarsus is undone.2016 This is a trouble grievous to be borne, but it does not come alone.
It is still harder to think that a city so placed as to be united with Cilicia, Cappadocia, and
Assyria, should be lightly thrown away by the madness of two or three individuals, while
you are all the while hesitating, settling what to do, and looking at one another’s faces. It
would have been far better to do like the doctors. (I have been so long an invalid that I have
no lack of illustrations of this kind.) When their patients’ pain becomes excessive they
produce insensibility; so should we pray that our souls may be made insensible to the pain
of our troubles, that we be not put under unendurable agony. In these hard straits I do not
fail to use one means of consolation. I look to your kindness; I try to make my troubles
milder by my thought and recollection of you.2017 When the eyes have looked intently on
any brilliant objects it relieves them to turn again to what is blue and green; the recollection
of your kindness and attention has just the same effect on my soul; it is a mild treatment
that takes away my pain. I feel this the more when I reflect that you individually have done
all that man could do. You have satisfactorily shewn us, men, if we judge things fairly, that
the catastrophe is in no way due to you personally. The reward which you have won at
God’s hand for your zeal for right is no small one. May the Lord grant you to me and to
His churches to the improvement of life and the guidance of souls, and may He once more
allow me the privilege of meeting you.</p>

<head>Letter XXXVIII.2022</head>
<head>To his Brother Gregory, concerning the difference between οὐσία and ὑπόστασις.</head>
<p>1. Many persons, in their study of the sacred dogmas, failing to distinguish between
what is common in the essence or substance, and the meaning of the hypostases, arrive at
the same notions, and think that it makes no difference whether οὐσία or hypostasis be
spoken of. The result is that some of those who accept statements on these subjects without
any enquiry, are pleased to speak of “one hypostasis,” just as they do of one “essence” or
“substance;” while on the other hand those who accept three hypostases are under the idea
that they are bound in accordance with this confession, to assert also, by numerical analogy,
three essences or substances. Under these circumstances, lest you fall into similar error, I
have composed a short treatise for you by way of memorandum. The meaning of the words,
to put it shortly, is as follows:</p>
<p>2. Of all nouns the sense of some, which are predicated of subjects plural and numerically
various, is more general; as for instance man. When we so say, we employ the noun to indicate
the common nature, and do not confine our meaning to any one man in particular
who is known by that name. Peter, for instance is no more man, than Andrew, John, or
James. The predicate therefore being common, and extending to all the individuals ranked
under the same name, requires some note of distinction whereby we may understand not
man in general, but Peter or John in particular.</p>
<p>Of some nouns on the other hand the denotation is more limited; and by the aid of the
limitation we have before our minds not the common nature, but a limitation of anything,
having, so far as the peculiarity extends, nothing in common with what is of the same kind;
as for instance, Paul or Timothy. For, in a word, of this kind there is no extension to what
is common in the nature; there is a separation of certain circumscribed conceptions from
the general idea, and expression of them by means of their names. Suppose then that two
or more are set together, as, for instance, Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, and that an enquiry
is made into the essence or substance of humanity; no one will give one definition of essence
or substance in the case of Paul, a second in that of Silvanus, and a third in that of Timothy;
but the same words which have been employed in setting forth the essence or substance of
Paul will apply to the others also. Those who are described by the same definition of essence
or substance are of the same essence or substance2023 when the enquirer has learned what
is common, and turns his attention to the differentiating properties whereby one is distin-

guished from another, the definition by which each is known will no longer tally in all particulars
with the definition of another, even though in some points it be found to agree.</p>
<p>3. My statement, then, is this. That which is spoken of in a special and peculiar manner
is indicated by the name of the hypostasis. Suppose we say “a man.” The indefinite meaning
of the word strikes a certain vague sense upon the ears. The nature is indicated, but what
subsists and is specially and peculiarly indicated by the name is not made plain. Suppose
we say “Paul.” We set forth, by what is indicated by the name, the nature subsisting.2024</p>
<p>This then is the hypostasis, or “understanding;” not the indefinite conception of the essence
or substance, which, because what is signified is general, finds no “standing,” but the
conception which by means of the expressed peculiarities gives standing and circumscription
to the general and uncircumscribed. It is customary in Scripture to make a distinction of
this kind, as well in many other passages as in the History of Job. When purposing to narrate
the events of his life, Job first mentions the common, and says “a man;” then he straightway
particularizes by adding “a certain.”2025 As to the description of the essence, as having no
bearing on the scope of his work, he is silent, but by means of particular notes of identity,
mentioning the place and points of character, and such external qualifications as would individualize,
and separate from the common and general idea, he specifies the “certain man,”
in such a way that from name, place, mental qualities, and outside circumstances, the description
of the man whose life is being narrated is made in all particulars perfectly clear.
If he had been giving an account of the essence, there would not in his explanation of the
nature have been any mention of these matters. The same moreover would have been the
account that there is in the case of Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and each
of the men there mentioned.2026 Transfer, then, to the divine dogmas the same standard
of difference which you recognise in the case both of essence and of hypostasis in human
affairs, and you will not go wrong. Whatever your thought suggests to you as to the mode
of the existence of the Father, you will think also in the case of the Son, and in like manner
too of the Holy Ghost. For it is idle to bait the mind at any detached conception from the
conviction that it is beyond all conception.2027 For the account of the uncreate and of the
incomprehensible is one and the same in the case of the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Ghost. For one is not more incomprehensible and uncreate than another. And since
it is necessary, by means of the notes of differentiation, in the case of the Trinity, to keep

the distinction unconfounded, we shall not take into consideration, in order to estimate
that which differentiates, what is contemplated in common, as the uncreate, or what is
beyond all comprehension, or any quality of this nature; we shall only direct our attention
to the enquiry by what means each particular conception will be lucidly and distinctly separated
from that which is conceived of in common.</p>
<p>4. Now the proper way to direct our investigation seems to me to be as follows. We
say that every good thing, which by God’s providence befalls us, is an operation, of the Grace
which worketh in us all things, as the apostle says, “But all these worketh that one and the
self same Spirit dividing to every man severally as he will.”2028 If we ask, if the supply of
good things which thus comes to the saints has its origin in the Holy Ghost alone, we are
on the other hand guided by Scripture to the belief that of the supply of the good things
which are wrought in us through the Holy Ghost, the Originator and Cause is the Onlybegotten
God;2029 for we are taught by Holy Scripture that “All things were made by
Him,”2030 and “by Him consist.”2031 When we are exalted to this conception, again, led by
God-inspired guidance, we are taught that by that power all things are brought from nonbeing
into being, but yet not by that power to the exclusion of origination.2032 On the
other hand there is a certain power subsisting without generation and without origination,2033
which is the cause of the cause of all things. For the Son, by whom are all things, and with
whom the Holy Ghost is inseparably conceived of, is of the Father.2034 For it is not possible
for any one to conceive of the Son if he be not previously enlightened by the Spirit. Since,
then, the Holy Ghost, from Whom all the supply of good things for creation has its source,
is attached to the Son, and with Him is inseparably apprehended, and has Its2035 being attached
to the Father, as cause, from Whom also It proceeds; It has this note of Its peculiar
hypostatic nature, that It is known after the Son2036 and together with the Son, and that It

has Its subsistence of the Father. The Son, Who declares the Spirit proceeding from the
Father through Himself and with Himself, shining forth alone and by only-begetting from
the unbegotten light, so far as the peculiar notes are concerned, has nothing in common
either with the Father or with the Holy Ghost. He alone is known by the stated signs. But
God, Who is over all, alone has, as one special mark of His own hypostasis, His being
Father, and His deriving His hypostasis2037 from no cause; and through this mark He is
peculiarly known. Wherefore in the communion of the substance we maintain that there
is no mutual approach or intercommunion of those notes of indication perceived in the
Trinity, whereby is set forth the proper peculiarity of the Persons delivered in the faith, each
of these being distinctively apprehended by His own notes. Hence, in accordance with the
stated signs of indication, discovery is made of the separation of the hypostases; while so
far as relates to the infinite, the incomprehensible, the uncreate, the uncircumscribed, and
similar attributes, there is no variableness in the life-giving nature; in that, I mean, of Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, but in Them is seen a certain communion indissoluble and continuous.
And by the same considerations, whereby a reflective student could perceive the greatness
of any one of the (Persons) believed in in the Holy Trinity, he will proceed without variation.
Beholding the glory in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, his mind all the while recognises no
void interval wherein it may travel between Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, for there is nothing
inserted between Them; nor beyond the divine nature is there anything so subsisting as to
be able to divide that nature from itself by the interposition of any foreign matter. Neither
is there any vacuum of interval, void of subsistence, which can make a break in the mutual
harmony of the divine essence, and solve the continuity by the interjection of emptiness.
He who perceives the Father, and perceives Him by Himself, has at the same time mental
perception of the Son; and he who receives the Son does not divide Him from the Spirit,
but, in consecution so far as order is concerned, in conjunction so far as nature is concerned,
expresses the faith commingled in himself in the three together. He who makes mention
of the Spirit alone, embraces also in this confession Him of whom He is the Spirit. And
since the Spirit is Christ’s and of God,2038 as says Paul, then just as he who lays hold on one
end of the chain pulls the other to him, so he who “draws the Spirit,”2039 as says the
prophet, by His means draws to him at the same time both the Son and the Father. And if
any one verily receives the Son, he will hold Him on both sides, the Son drawing towards

him on the one His own Father, and on the other His own Spirit. For He who eternally exists
in the Father can never be cut off from the Father, nor can He who worketh all things by
the Spirit ever be disjoined from His own Spirit. Likewise moreover he who receives the
Father virtually receives at the same time both the Son and the Spirit; for it is in no wise
possible to entertain the idea of severance or division, in such a way as that the Son should
be thought of apart from the Father, or the Spirit be disjoined from the Son. But the communion
and the distinction apprehended in Them are, in a certain sense, ineffable and inconceivable,
the continuity of nature being never rent asunder by the distinction of the hypostases,
nor the notes of proper distinction confounded in the community of essence.
Marvel not then at my speaking of the same thing as being both conjoined and parted, and
thinking as it were darkly in a riddle, of a certain2040 new and strange conjoined separation
and separated conjunction. Indeed, even in objects perceptible to the senses, any one who
approaches the subject in a candid and uncontentious spirit, may find similar conditions
of things.</p>
<p>5. Yet receive what I say as at best a token and reflexion of the truth; not as the actual
truth itself. For it is not possible that there should be complete correspondence between
what is seen in the tokens and the objects in reference to which the use of tokens is adopted.
Why then do I say that an analogy of the separate and the conjoined is found in objects
perceptible to the senses? You have before now, in springtime, beheld the brightness of the
bow in the cloud; the bow, I mean, which, in our common parlance, is called Iris, and is said
by persons skilled in such matters to be formed when a certain moisture is mingled with
the air, and the force of the winds expresses what is dense and moist in the vapour, after it
has become cloudy, into rain. The bow is said to be formed as follows. When the sunbeam,
after traversing obliquely the dense and darkened portion of the cloud-formation, has directly
cast its own orb on some cloud, the radiance is then reflected back from what is moist and
shining, and the result is a bending and return, as it were, of the light upon itself. For flame-
like flashings are so constituted that if they fall on any smooth surface they are refracted on
themselves; and the shape of the sun, which by means of the beam is formed on the moist
and smooth part of the air, is round. The necessary consequence therefore is that the air
adjacent to the cloud is marked out by means of the radiant brilliance in conformity with
the shape of the sun’s disc. Now this brilliance is both continuous and divided. It is of many
colours; it is of many forms; it is insensibly steeped in the variegated bright tints of its dye;
imperceptibly abstracting from our vision the combination of many coloured things, with
the result that no space, mixing or paring within itself the difference of colour, can be dis-
<note type="footnote">2040 ὥσπερ ἐκ αἰνίγματι. cf. 1 Cor. xiii. 12. ἐν αἰνίγματι or ἐξ αἰνιγμάτων, as in Æsch., Ag. 1113=by dark
hints. The bold oxymoron concluding this sentence is illustrated by Ovid’s “impietate pia” (Met. viii. 477), Lucan’s
“concordia discors” (Phars. i. 98), or Tennyson’s “faith unfaithful.”</note>

<pb n="431"/>
cerned either between blue and flame-coloured, or between flame-coloured and red, or
between red and amber. For all the rays, seen at the same time, are far shining, and while
they give no signs of their mutual combination, are incapable of being tested, so that it is
impossible to discover the limits of the flame-coloured or of the emerald portion of the light,
and at what point each originates before it appears as it does in glory. As then in the token
we clearly distinguish the difference of the colours, and yet it is impossible for us to apprehend
by our senses any interval between them; so in like manner conclude, I pray you, that you
may reason concerning the divine dogmas; that the peculiar properties of the hypostases,
like colours seen in the Iris, flash their brightness on each of the Persons Whom we believe
to exist in the Holy Trinity; but that of the proper nature no difference can be conceived as
existing between one and the other, the peculiar characteristics shining, in community of
essence, upon each. Even in our example, the essence emitting the many-coloured radiance,
and refracted by the sunbeam, was one essence; it is the colour of the phænomenon which
is multiform. My argument thus teaches us, even by the aid of the visible creation, not to
feel distressed at points of doctrine whenever we meet with questions difficult of solution,
and when at the thought of accepting what is proposed to us, our brains begin to reel. In
regard to visible objects experience appears better than theories of causation, and so in
matters transcending all knowledge, the apprehension of argument is inferior to the faith
which teaches us at once the distinction in hypostasis and the conjunction in essence. Since
then our discussion has included both what is common and what is distinctive in the Holy
Trinity, the common is to be understood as referring to the essence; the hypostasis on the
other hand is the several distinctive sign.2041</p>
<p>6. It may however be thought that the account here given of the hypostasis does not
tally with the sense of the Apostle’s words, where he says concerning the Lord that He is
“the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His person,”2042 for if we have taught
hypostasis to be the conflux of the several properties; and if it is confessed that, as in the
case of the Father something is contemplated as proper and peculiar, whereby He alone is
known, so in the same way is it believed about the Only-begotten; how then does Scripture
in this place ascribe the name of the hypostasis to the Father alone, and describes the Son
as form of the hypostasis, and designated not by His own proper notes, but by those of the
<note type="footnote">2041 The scientific part of the analogy of the rainbow is of course obsolete and valueless. The general principle
holds good that what is beyond comprehension in theology finds its parallel in what is beyond comprehension
in the visible world. We are not to be staggered and turn dizzy in either sphere of thought at the discovery that
we have reached a limit beyond which thought cannot go. We may live in a finite world, though infinite space
is beyond our powers of thought: we may trust in God revealed in the Trinity, though we cannot analyse or
define Him.</note>
<note type="footnote">2042 Heb. i. 3.</note>

<pb n="432"/>
Father? For if the hypostasis is the sign of several existence, and the property of the Father
is confined to the unbegotten being, and the Son is fashioned according to His Father’s
properties, then the term unbegotten can no longer be predicated exclusively of the Father,
the existence of the Only-begotten being denoted by the distinctive note of the Father.</p>
<p>7. My opinion is, however, that in this passage the Apostle’s argument is directed to a
different end; and it is looking to this that he uses the terms “brightness of glory,” and “express
image of person.” Whoever keeps this carefully in view will find nothing that clashes
with what I have said, but that the argument is conducted in a special and peculiar sense.
For the object of the apostolic argument is not the distinction of the hypostases from one
another by means of the apparent notes; it is rather the apprehension of the natural, inseparable,
and close relationship of the Son to the Father. He does not say “Who being the
glory of the Father” (although in truth He is); he omits this as admitted, and then in the
endeavour to teach that we must not think of one form of glory in the case of the Father
and of another in that of the Son, He defines the glory of the Only-begotten as the brightness
of the glory of the Father, and, by the use of the example of the light, causes the Son to be
thought of in indissoluble association with the Father. For just as the brightness is emitted
by the flame, and the brightness is not after the flame, but at one and the same moment the
flame shines and the light beams brightly, so does the Apostle mean the Son to be thought
of as deriving existence from the Father, and yet the Only-begotten not to be divided from
the existence of the Father by any intervening extension in space, but the caused to be always
conceived of together with the cause. Precisely in the same manner, as though by way of
interpretation of the meaning of the preceding cause, and with the object of guiding us to
the conception of the invisible by means of material examples, he speaks also of “express
image of person.” For as the body is wholly in form, and yet the definition of the body and
the definition of the form are distinct, and no one wishing to give the definition of the one
would be found in agreement with that of the other; and yet, even if in theory you separate
the form from the body, nature does not admit of the distinction, and both are inseparably
apprehended; just so the Apostle thinks that even if the doctrine of the faith represents the
difference of the hypostases as unconfounded and distinct, he is bound by his language to
set forth also the continuous and as it were concrete relation of the Only-begotten to the
Father. And this he states, not as though the Only-begotten had not also a hypostatic being,
but in that the union does not admit of anything intervening between the Son and the
Father, with the result that he, who with his soul’s eyes fixes his gaze earnestly on the express
image of the Only-begotten, is made perceptive also of the hypostasis of the Father. Yet the
proper quality contemplated in them is not subject to change, nor yet to commixture, in
such wise as that we should attribute either an origin of generation to the Father or an origin
without generation to the Son, but so that if we could compass the impossibility of detaching
one from the other, that one might be apprehended severally and alone, for, since the mere

<pb n="433"/>
name implies the Father, it is not possible that any one should even name the Son without
apprehending the Father.2043</p>
<p>8. Since then, as says the Lord in the Gospels,2044 he that hath seen the Son sees the
Father also; on this account he says that the Only-begotten is the express image of His
Father’s person. That this may be made still plainer I will quote also other passages of the
apostle in which he calls the Son “the image of the invisible God,”2045 and again “image of
His goodness;”2046 not because the image differs from the Archetype according to the
definition of indivisibility and goodness, but that it may be shewn that it is the same as the
prototype, even though it be different. For the idea of the image would be lost were it not
to preserve throughout the plain and invariable likeness. He therefore that has perception
of the beauty of the image is made perceptive of the Archetype. So he, who has, as it were
mental apprehension of the form of the Son, prints the express image of the Father’s hypostasis,
beholding the latter in the former, not beholding in the reflection the unbegotten
being of the Father (for thus there would be complete identity and no distinction), but gazing
at the unbegotten beauty in the Begotten. Just as he who in a polished mirror beholds the
reflection of the form as plain knowledge of the represented face, so he, who has knowledge
of the Son, through his knowledge of the Son receives in his heart the express image of the
Father’s Person. For all things that are the Father’s are beheld in the Son, and all things that
are the Son’s are the Father’s; because the whole Son is in the Father and has all the Father
in Himself.2047 Thus the hypostasis of the Son becomes as it were form and face of the
knowledge of the Father, and the hypostasis of the Father is known in the form of the Son,
while the proper quality which is contemplated therein remains for the plain distinction of
the hypostases.</p>

<head>Julian2049 to Basil.</head>
<p>The proverb says “You are not proclaiming war,”2050 and, let me add, out of the comedy,
“O messenger of golden words.”2051 Come then; prove this in act, and hasten to me. You
will come as friend to friend. Conspicuous and unremitting devotion to business seems, to
those that treat it as of secondary importance, a heavy burden; yet the diligent are modest,
as I persuade myself, sensible, and ready for any emergency. I allow myself relaxations so
that even rest may be permitted to one who neglects nothing. Our mode of life is not marked
by the court hypocrisy, of which I think you have had some experience, and in accordance
with which compliments mean deadlier hatred than is felt to our worst foes; but, with becoming
freedom, while we blame and rebuke where blame is due, we love with the love of
the dearest friends. I may therefore, let me say, with all sincerity, both be diligent in relaxation
and, when at work, not get worn out, and sleep secure; since when awake I do not wake
more for myself, than, as is fit, for every one else. I am afraid this is rather silly and trifling,
as I feel rather lazy, (I praise myself like Astydamas2052) but I am writing to prove to you
that to have the pleasure of seeing you, wise man as you are, will be more likely to do me
good than to cause any difficulty. Therefore, as I have said, lose no time: travel post haste.
After you have paid me as long a visit as you like, you shall go on your journey, whithersoever
you will, with my best wishes.</p>

<note type="footnote">2049 These Letters are placed in this order by the Ben. Editors as being written, if genuine, before Basil’s
episcopate. Maran (Vita S. Bas. Cap. ii.) is puzzled at Basil’s assertion in xli. that he learned the Bible with Julian,
and points out that at Athens they devoted themselves to profane literature. But this may have allowed intervals
for other work. In 344, when Basil was at Cæsarea, Julian was relegated by Constantius to the neighbouring
fortress of Macellum, and there, with his elder half-brother Gallus, spent six years in compulsory retirement.
Sozomen tells us that the brothers studied the Scripture and became Readers (Soz. v. 2; Amm. Marc. xv. 2, 7).
Their seclusion, in which they were reduced to the society of their own household (Greg. Naz., Or. iii., Julian,
Ad. Ath. 271 c.), may not have been so complete as to prevent all intercourse with a harmless schoolboy like
Basil. “Malgré l’authorité de dom Maran, nous croyons avec Tillemont, Dupont et M. Albert de Broglie, que cette

<head>Julian to Basil.</head>
<p>While showing up to the present time the gentleness and benevolence which have been
natural to me from my boyhood, I have reduced all who dwell beneath the sun to obedience.
For lo! every tribe of barbarians to the shores of ocean has come to lay its gifts before my
feet. So too the Sagadares who dwell beyond the Danube, wondrous with their bright tattooing,
and hardly like human beings, so wild and strange are they, now grovel at my feet,
and pledge themselves to obey all the behests my sovereignty imposes on them. I have a
further object. I must as soon as possible march to Persia and rout and make a tributary of
that Sapor, descendant of Darius. I mean too to devastate the country of the Indians and
the Saracens until they all acknowledge my superiority and become my tributaries. You,
however, profess a wisdom above and beyond these things; you call yourself clad with piety,
but your clothing is really impudence and everywhere you slander me as one unworthy of
the imperial dignity. Do you not know that I am the grandson of the illustrious Constantius?
2054 I know this of you, and yet I do not change the old feelings which I had to you, and
you to me in the days when we were both young.2055 But of my merciful will I command
that a thousand pounds of gold be sent me from you, when I pass by Cæsarea; for I am still
on the march, and with all possible dispatch am hurrying to the Persian campaign. If you
refuse I am prepared to destroy Cæsarea, to overthrow the buildings that have long adorned
it; to erect in their place temples and statues; and so to induce all men to submit to the Emperor
of the Romans and not exalt themselves. Wherefore I charge you to send me without
fail by the hands of some trusty messenger the stipulated gold, after duly counting and
weighing it, and sealing it with your ring. In this way I may show mercy to you for your
errors, if you acknowledge, however late, that no excuses will avail. I have learned to know,
and to condemn, what once I read.2056</p>

<head>Letter XLI.2057</head>
<head>Basil to Julian.</head>
<p>1. The heroic deeds of your present splendour are small, and your grand attack against
me, or rather against yourself, is paltry. When I think of you robed in purple, a crown on
your dishonoured head, which, so long as true religion is absent, rather disgraces than graces
your empire, I tremble. And you yourself who have risen to be so high and great, now that
vile and honour-hating demons have brought you to this pass, have begun not only to exalt
yourself above all human nature, but even to uplift yourself against God, and insult His
Church, mother and nurse of all, by sending to me, most insignificant of men, orders to
forward you a thousand pounds of gold. I am not so much astonished at the weight of the
gold, although it is very serious; but it has made me shed bitter tears over your so rapid ruin.
I bethink me how you and I have learned together the lessons of the best and holiest books.
Each of us went through the sacred and God-inspired Scriptures. Then nothing was hid
from you. Nowadays you have become lost to proper feeling, beleaguered as you are with
pride. Your serene Highness did not find out for the first time yesterday that I do not live
in the midst of superabundant wealth. To-day you have demanded a thousand pounds of
gold of me. I hope your serenity will deign to spare me. My property amounts to so much,
that I really shall not have enough to eat as much as I shall like to-day. Under my roof the
art of cookery is dead. My servants’ knife never touches blood. The most important viands,
in which lies our abundance, are leaves of herbs with very coarse bread and sour wine, so
that our senses are not dulled by gluttony, and do not indulge in excess.</p>
<p>2. Your excellent tribune Lausus, trusty minister of your orders, has also reported to
me that a certain woman came as a suppliant to your serenity on the occasion of the death
of her son by poison; that it has been judged by you that poisoners are not allowed to exist;
2058 if any there be, that they are to be destroyed, or, only those are reserved, who are to
fight with beasts. And, this rightly decided by you, seems strange to me, for your efforts to
cure the pain of great wounds by petty remedies are to the last degree ridiculous. After insulting
God, it is useless for you to give heed to widows and orphans. The former is mad
and dangerous; the latter the part of a merciful and kindly man. It is a serious thing for a
private individual like myself to speak to an emperor; it will be more serious for you to speak

<head>Letter XLII.2060</head>
<head>To Chilo, his disciple.</head>
<p>1. If, my true brother, you gladly suffer yourself to be advised by me as to what course
of action you should pursue, specially in the points in which you have referred to me for
advice, you will owe me your salvation. Many men have had the courage to enter upon the
solitary life; but to live it out to the end is a task which perhaps has been achieved by few.
The end is not necessarily involved in the intention; yet in the end is the guerdon of the
toil. No advantage, therefore, accrues to men who fail to press on to the end of what they
have in view and only adopt the solitary’s life in its inception. Nay, they make their profession
ridiculous, and are charged by outsiders with unmanliness and instability of purpose. Of
these, moreover, the Lord says, who wishing to build a house “sitteth not down first and
counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it? lest haply after he hath laid the
foundation and is not able to finish it,” the passers-by “begin to mock him saying,” this man
laid a foundation “and was not able to finish.”2061 Let the start, then, mean that you heartily
advance in virtue. The right noble athlete Paul, wishing us not to rest in easy security on
so much of our life as may have been lived well in the past, but, every day to attain further
progress, says “Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those
things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling.”2062 So
truly stands the whole of human life, not contented with what has gone before and fed not
so much on the past as on the future. For how is a man the better for having his belly filled
yesterday, if his natural hunger fails to find its proper satisfaction in food to-day? In the
same way the soul gains nothing by yesterday’s virtue unless it be followed by the right
conduct of to-day. For it is said “I shall judge thee as I shall find thee.”</p>
<p>2. Vain then is the labour of the righteous man, and free from blame is the way of the
sinner, if a change befall, and the former turn from the better to the worse, and the latter
from the worse to the better. So we hear from Ezekiel teaching as it were in the name of the
Lord, when he says, “if the righteous turneth away and committeth iniquity, I will not remember
the righteousness which he committed before; in his sin he shall die,”2063 and so
too about the sinner; if he turn away from his wickedness, and do that which is right, he

shall live. Where were all the labours of God’s servant Moses, when the gainsaying of one
moment shut him out from entering into the promised land? What became of the companionship
of Gehazi with Elissæus, when he brought leprosy on himself by his covetousness?
What availed all Solomon’s vast wisdom, and his previous regard for God, when afterwards
from his mad love of women he fell into idolatry? Not even the blessed David was blameless,
when his thoughts went astray and he sinned against the wife of Uriah. One example were
surely enough for keeping safe one who is living a godly life, the fall from the better to the
worse of Judas, who, after being so long Christ’s disciple, for a mean gain sold his Master
and got a halter for himself. Learn then, brother, that it is not he who begins well who is
perfect. It is he who ends well who is approved in God’s sight. Give then no sleep to your
eyes or slumber to your eyelids2064 that you may be delivered “as a roe from the net and a
bird from the snare.”2065 For, behold, you are passing through the midst of snares; you are
treading on the top of a high wall whence a fall is perilous to the faller; wherefore do not
straightway attempt extreme discipline; above all things beware of confidence in yourself,
lest you fall from a height of discipline through want of training. It is better to advance a
little at a time. Withdraw then by degrees from the pleasures of life, gradually destroying
all your wonted habits, lest you bring on yourself a crowd of temptations by irritating all
your passions at once. When you have mastered one passion, then begin to wage war against
another, and in this manner you will in good time get the better of all. Indulgence, so far
as the name goes, is one, but its practical workings are diverse. First then, brother, meet
every temptation with patient endurance. And by what various temptations the faithful
man is proved; by worldly loss, by accusations, by lies, by opposition, by calumny, by persecution!
These and the like are the tests of the faithful. Further, be quiet, not rash in speech,
not quarrelsome, not disputatious, not covetous of vain glory, not more anxious to get than
to give knowledge,2066 not a man of many words, but always more ready to learn than to
teach. Do not trouble yourself about worldly life; from it no good can come to you. It is
said, “That my mouth speak not the works of men.”2067 The man who is fond of talking
about sinners’ doings, soon rouses the desire for self indulgence; much better busy yourself
about the lives of good men for so you will get some profit for yourself. Do not be anxious
to go travelling about2068 from village to village and house to house; rather avoid them as
traps for souls. If any one, for true pity’s sake, invite you with many pleas to enter his house,
let him be told to follow the faith of the centurion, who, when Jesus was hastening to him

to perform an act of healing, besought him not to do so in the words, “Lord I am not worthy
that thou shouldest come under my roof, but speak the word only and my servant shall be
healed,”2069 and when Jesus had said to him “Go thy way; as thou hast believed, so be it
done unto thee,”2070 his servant was healed from that hour. Learn then, brother, that it was
the faith of the suppliant, not the presence of Christ, which delivered the sick man. So too
now, if you pray, in whatever place you be, and the sick man believes that he will be aided
by your prayers, all will fall out as he desires.</p>
<p>3. You will not love your kinsfolk more than the Lord. “He that loveth,” He says,
“father, or mother, or brother, more than me, is not worthy of me.”2071 What is the meaning
of the Lord’s commandment? “He that taketh not up his cross and followeth after me,
cannot be my disciple?”2072 If, together with Christ, you died to your kinsfolk according
to the flesh, why do you wish to live with them again? If for your kinsfolk’s sake you are
building up again what you destroyed for Christ’s sake, you make yourself a transgressor.
Do not then for your kinsfolk’s sake abandon your place: if you abandon your place, perhaps
you will abandon your mode of life. Love not the crowd, nor the country, nor the town;
love the desert, ever abiding by yourself with no wandering mind,2073 regarding prayer and
praise as your life’s work. Never neglect reading, especially of the New Testament, because
very frequently mischief comes of reading the Old; not because what is written is harmful,
but because the minds of the injured are weak. All bread is nutritious, but it may be injurious
to the sick. Just so all Scripture is God inspired and profitable,2074 and there is nothing in
it unclean: only to him who thinks it is unclean, to him it is unclean. “Prove all things; hold
fast that which is good; abstain from every form of evil.”2075 “All things are lawful but all
things are not expedient.”2076 Among all, with whom you come in contact, be in all things
a giver of no offence,2077 cheerful, “loving as a brother,”2078 pleasant, humble-minded,
never missing the mark of hospitality through extravagance of meats, but always content
with what is at hand. Take no more from any one than the daily necessaries of the solitary

life. Above all things shun gold as the soul’s foe, the father of sin and the agent of the devil.
Do not expose yourself to the charge of covetousness on the pretence of ministering to the
poor; but, if any one brings you money for the poor and you know of any who are in need,
advise the owner himself to convey it to his needy brothers, lest haply your conscience may
be defiled by the acceptance of money.</p>
<p>4. Shun pleasures; seek after continence; train your body to hard work; accustom your
soul to trials. Regarding the dissolution of soul and body as release from every evil, await
that enjoyment of everlasting good things in which all the saints have part. Ever, as it were,
holding the balance against every suggestion of the devil throw in a holy thought, and, as
the scale inclines do thou go with it. Above all when the evil thought starts up and says,
“What is the good of your passing your life in this place? What do you gain by withdrawing
yourself from the society of men? Do you not know that those, who are ordained by God
to be bishops of God’s churches, constantly associate with their fellows, and indefatigably
attend spiritual gatherings at which those who are present derive very great advantage?
There are to be enjoyed explanations of hard sayings, expositions of the teachings of the
apostles, interpretations of the thoughts of the gospels, lessons in theology and the intercourse
of spiritual brethren, who do great good to all they meet if only by the sight of their faces.
You, however, who have decided to be a stranger to all these good things, are sitting here
in a wild state like the beasts. You see round you a wide desert with scarcely a fellow creature
in it, lack of all instruction, estrangement from your brothers, and your spirit inactive in
carrying out the commandments of God.” Now, when the evil thought rises against you,
with all these ingenious pretexts and wishes to destroy you, oppose to it in pious reflection
your own practical experience, and say, You tell me that the things in the world are good;
the reason why I came here is because I judged myself unfit for the good things of the world.
With the world’s good things are mingled evil things, and the evil things distinctly have the
upper hand. Once when I attended the spiritual assemblies I did with difficulty find one
brother, who, so far as I could see, feared God, but he was a victim of the devil, and I heard
from him amusing stories and tales made up to deceive those whom he met. After him I
fell in with many thieves, plunderers, tyrants. I saw disgraceful drunkards; I saw the blood
of the oppressed; I saw women’s beauty, which tortured my chastity. From actual fornication
I fled, but I defiled my virginity by the thoughts of my heart. I heard many discourses which
were good for the soul, but I could not discover in the case of any one of the teachers that
his life was worthy of his words. After this, again, I heard a great number of plays, which
were made attractive by wanton songs. Then I heard a lyre sweetly played, the applause of
tumblers, the talk of clowns, all kinds of jests and follies and all the noises of a crowd. I saw
the tears of the robbed, the agony of the victims of tyranny, the shrieks of the tortured. I
looked and lo, there was no spiritual assembly, but only a sea, wind-tossed and agitated,

<pb n="442"/>
and trying to drown every one at once under its waves.2079 Tell me, O evil thought, tell me,
dæmon of short lived pleasure and vain glory, what is the good of my seeing and hearing
all these things, when I am powerless to succour any of those who are thus wronged; when
I am allowed neither to defend the helpless nor correct the fallen; when I am perhaps doomed
to destroy myself too. For just as a very little fresh water is blown away by a storm of wind
and dust, in like manner the good deeds, that we think we do in this life, are overwhelmed
by the multitude of evils. Pieces acted for men in this life are driven through joy and merriment,
like stakes into their hearts, so that the brightness of their worship is be-dimmed.
But the wails and lamentations of men wronged by their fellows are introduced to make a
show of the patience of the poor.</p>
<p>5. What good then do I get except the loss of my soul? For this reason I migrate to the
hills like a bird. “I am escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers.”2080 I am living, O
evil thought, in the desert in which the Lord lived. Here is the oak of Mamre; here is the
ladder going up to heaven, and the stronghold of the angels which Jacob saw; here is the
wilderness in which the people purified received the law, and so came into the land of
promise and saw God. Here is Mount Carmel where Elias sojourned and pleased God.
Here is the plain whither Esdras withdrew, and at God’s bidding uttered all the God inspired
books.2081 Here is the wilderness in which the blessed John ate locusts and preached repentance
to men. Here is the Mount of Olives, whither Christ came and prayed, and taught us
to pray. Here is Christ the lover of the wilderness, for He says “Where two or three are
gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them.”2082 “Here is the strait and

<head>To a lapsed Monk.2093</head>
<p>1. I do not wish you joy, for there is no joy for the wicked. Even now I cannot believe
it; my heart cannot conceive iniquity so great as the crime which you have committed; if,
that is, the truth really is what is generally understood. I am at a loss to think how wisdom
so deep can have been made to disappear; how such exact discipline can have been undone;
whence blindness so profound can have been shed round you; how with utter inconsider-
ateness you have wrought such destruction of souls. If this be true, you have given over
your own soul to the pit, and have slackened the earnestness of all who have heard of your
impiety. You have set at nought the faith; you have missed the glorious fight. I grieve over
you. What cleric2094 does not lament as he hears? What ecclesiastic does not beat the
breast? What layman is not downcast? What ascetic is not sad? Haply, even the sun has
grown dark at your fall, and the powers of heaven have been shaken at your destruction.
Even senseless stones have shed tears at your madness; even your enemies have wept at the
greatness of your iniquity. Oh hardness of heart! Oh cruelty! You did not fear God; you
did not reverence men; you cared nothing for your friends; you made shipwreck of all at
once; at once you were stripped of all. Once more I grieve over you, unhappy man. You
were proclaiming to all the power of the kingdom, and you fell from it. You were making
all stand in fear of your teaching, and there was no fear of God before your eyes. You were
preaching purity, and you are found polluted. You were priding yourself on your poverty,
and you are convicted of covetousness; you were demonstrating and explaining the chastisement
of God, and you yourself brought chastisement on your own head. How am I to
lament you, how grieve for you? How is Lucifer that was rising in the morning fallen and
dashed on the ground? Both the ears of every hearer will tingle. How is the Nazarite,
brighter than gold, become dark above pitch? How has the glorious son of Sion become an
unprofitable vessel! Of him, whose memory of the sacred Scriptures was in all men’s mouths,
the memory to-day has perished with the sound. The man of quick intelligence has quickly
perished. The man of manifold wit has wrought manifold iniquity. All who profited by
your teaching have been injured by your fall. All who came to listen to your conversation
have stopped their ears at your fall. I, sorrowful and downcast, weakened in every way,
eating ashes for bread and with sackcloth on my wound, am thus recounting your praises;

or rather, with none to comfort and none to cure, am making an inscription for a tomb.
For comfort is hid from my eyes. I have no salve, no oil, no bandage to put on. My wound
is sore, how shall I be healed?</p>
<p>2. If you have any hope of salvation; if you have the least thought of God, or any desire
for good things to come; if you have any fear of the chastisements reserved for the impenitent,
awake without delay, lift up your eyes to heaven, come to your senses, cease from your
wickedness, shake off the stupor that enwraps you, make a stand against the foe who has
struck you down. Make an effort to rise from the ground. Remember the good Shepherd
who will follow and rescue you. Though it be but two legs or a lobe of an ear,2095 spring
back from the beast that has wounded you. Remember the mercies of God and how He
cures with oil and wine. Do not despair of salvation. Recall your recollection of how it is
written in the Scriptures that he who is falling rises and he who turns away returns;2096 the
wounded is healed, the prey of beasts escapes; he who owns his sin is not rejected. The Lord
willeth not the death of a sinner but rather that he should turn and live.2097 Do not despise,
like the wicked in the pit of evil.2098 There is a time of endurance, a time of long suffering,
a time of healing, a time of correction. Have you stumbled? Arise. Have you sinned?
Cease. Do not stand in the way of sinners,2099 but spring away. When you are converted
and groan you shall be saved. Out of labour comes health, out of sweat salvation. Beware
lest, from your wish to keep certain obligations, you break the obligations to God which
you professed before many witnesses.2100 Pray do not hesitate to come to me for any earthly
considerations. When I have recovered my dead I shall lament, I shall tend him, I will weep
“because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people.”2101 All are ready to welcome you,
all will share your efforts. Do not sink back. Remember the days of old. There is salvation;
there is amendment. Be of good cheer; do not despair. It is not a law condemning to death
without pity, but mercy remitting punishment and awaiting improvement. The doors are
not yet shut; the bridegroom hears; sin is not the master. Make another effort, do not hesitate,
have pity on yourself and on all of us in Jesus Christ our Lord, to Whom be glory and
might now and for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Letter XLV.2102</head>
<head>To a lapsed Monk.</head>
<p>1. I am doubly alarmed to the very bottom of my heart, and you are the cause. I am
either the victim of some unkindly prepossession, and so am driven to make an unbrotherly
charge; or, with every wish to feel for you, and to deal gently with your troubles, I am forced
to take a different and an unfriendly attitude. Wherefore, even as I take my pen to write, I
have nerved my unwilling hand by reflection; but my face, downcast as it is, because of my
sorrow over you, I have had no power to change. I am so covered with shame, for your
sake, that my lips are turned to mourning and my mouth straightway falls. Ah me! What
am I to write? What shall I think in my perplexity?</p>
<p>If I call to mind your former empty mode of life, when you were rolling in riches and
had abundance of petty mundane reputation, I shudder; then you were followed by a mob
of flatterers, and had the short enjoyment of luxury, with obvious peril and unfair gain; on
the one hand, fear of the magistrates scattered your care for your salvation, on the other the
agitations of public affairs disturbed your home, and the continuance of troubles directed
your mind to Him Who is able to help you. Then, little by little, you took to seeking for the
Saviour, Who brings you fears for your good, Who delivers you and protects you, though
you mocked Him in your security. Then you began to train yourself for a change to a worthy
life, treating all your perilous property as mere dung, and abandoning the care of your
household and the society of your wife. All abroad like a stranger and a vagabond, wandering
through town and country, you betook yourself to Jerusalem.2103 There I myself lived with
you, and, for the toil of your ascetic discipline, called you blessed, when fasting for weeks
you continued in contemplation before God, shunning the society of your fellows, like a
routed runaway. Then you arranged for yourself a quiet and solitary life, and refused all
the disquiets of society. You pricked your body with rough sackcloth; you tightened a hard
belt round your loins; you bravely put wearing pressure on your bones; you made your sides
hang loose from front to back, and all hollow with fasting; you would wear no soft bandage,
and drawing in your stomach, like a gourd, made it adhere to the parts about your kidneys.
You emptied out all fat from your flesh; all the channels below your belly you dried up; your
belly itself you folded up for want of food; your ribs, like the caves of a house, you made to
overshadow all the parts about your middle, and, with all your body contracted, you spent

the long hours of the night in pouring out confession to God, and made your beard wet
with channels of tears. Why particularize? Remember how many mouths of saints you saluted
with a kiss, how many bodies you embraced, how many held your hands as undefiled,
how many servants God, as though in worship, ran and clasped you by the knees.</p>
<p>2. And what is the end of all this? My ears are wounded by a charge of adultery, flying
swifter than an arrow, and piercing my heart with a sharper sting. What crafty wiliness of
wizard has driven you into so deadly a trap? What many-meshed devil’s nets have entangled
you and disabled all the powers of your virtue? What has become of the story of your labours?
Or must we disbelieve them? How can we avoid giving credit to what has long been
hid when we see what is plain? What shall we say of your having by tremendous oaths
bound souls which fled for refuge to God, when what is more than yea and nay is carefully
attributed to the devil?2104 You have made yourself security for fatal perjury; and, by setting
the ascetic character at nought, you have cast blame even upon the Apostles and the very
Lord Himself. You have shamed the boast of purity. You have disgraced the promise of
chastity; we have been made a tragedy of captives, and our story is made a play of before
Jews and Greeks. You have made a split in the solitaries’ spirit, driving those of exacter
discipline into fear and cowardice, while they still wonder at the power of the devil, and seducing
the careless into imitation of your incontinence. So far as you have been able, you
have destroyed the boast of Christ, Who said, “Be of good cheer I have overcome the
world,”2105 and its Prince. You have mixed for your country a bowl of ill repute. Verily
you have proved the truth of the proverb, “Like a hart stricken through the liver.”2106</p>
<p>But what now? The tower of strength has not fallen, my brother. The remedies of correction
are not mocked; the city of refuge is not shut. Do not abide in the depths of evil.
Do not deliver yourself to the slayer of souls. The Lord knows how to set up them that are
dashed down. Do not try to flee afar off, but hasten to me. Resume once more the labours
of your youth, and by a fresh course of good deeds destroy the indulgence that creeps foully
along the ground. Look to the end, that has come so near to our life. See how now the sons
of Jews and Greeks are being driven to the worship of God, and do not altogether deny the
Saviour of the World. Never let that most awful sentence apply to you, “Depart from me,
I never knew you.”2107</p>

<head>To a fallen virgin.</head>
<p>1. Now is the time to quote the words of the prophet and to say, “Oh that my head were
waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of
the daughter of my people.”2109 Though they are wrapped in profound silence and lie
stunned by their misfortune, robbed of all sense of feeling by the fatal blow, I at all events
must not let such a fall go unlamented. If, to Jeremiah, it seemed that those whose bodies
had been wounded in war, were worthy of innumerable lamentations, what shall be said of
such a disaster of souls? “My slain men,” it is said, “are not slain with the sword, nor dead
in battle.”2110 But I am bewailing the sting of the real death, the grievousness of sin and the
fiery darts of the wicked one, which have savagely set on fire souls as well as bodies. Truly
God’s laws would groan aloud on seeing so great a pollution on the earth. They have pronounced
their prohibition of old “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife”;2111 and
through the holy gospels they say that “Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her,
hath committed adultery already with her in his heart.”2112 Now they see the bride of the
Lord herself, whose head is Christ, boldly committing adultery.2113 So too would groan
the companies2114 of the Saints. Phinehas, the zealous, because he can now no more take
his spear into his hands and avenge the outrage on the bodies; and John the Baptist, because
he cannot quit the realms above, as in his life he left the wilderness, to hasten to convict
iniquity, and if he must suffer for the deed, rather lose his head than his freedom to speak.
But, peradventure, like the blessed Abel, he too though dead yet speaks to us,2115 and now
exclaims, more loudly than John of old concerning Herodias, “It is not lawful for thee to
have her.”2116 For even if the body of John in obedience to the law of nature has received
the sentence of God, and his tongue is silent, yet “the word of God is not bound.”2117 John,
when he saw the wedlock of a fellow servant set at nought, was bold to rebuke even to the

death: how would he feel on seeing such an outrage wreaked on the marriage chamber of
the Lord?</p>
<p>2. You have flung away the yoke of that divine union; you have fled from the undefiled
chamber of the true King; you have shamefully fallen into this disgraceful and impious
corruption; and now that you cannot avoid this painful charge, and have no means or device
to conceal your trouble, you rush into insolence. The wicked man after falling into a pit of
iniquity always begins to despise, and you are denying your actual covenant with the true
bridegroom; you say that you are not a virgin, and made no promise, although you have
undertaken and publicly professed many pledges of virginity. Remember the good profession
which you witnessed2118 before God, angels, and men. Remember the hallowed intercourse,
the sacred company of virgins, the assembly of the Lord, the Church of the holy. Remember
your grandmother, grown old in Christ, still youthful and vigorous in virtue; and your
mother vying with her in the Lord, and striving to break with ordinary life in strange and
unwonted toils; remember your sister, who copies their doings, nay, endeavours to surpass
them, and goes beyond the good deeds of her fathers in her virgin graces, and earnestly
challenges by word and deed you her sister, as she thinks, to like efforts, while she earnestly
prays that your virginity be preserved.2119 All these call to mind, and your holy service of
God with them, your life spiritual, though in the flesh; your conversation heavenly, though
on earth. Remember days of calm, nights lighted up, spiritual songs, sweet music of psalms,
saintly prayers, a bed pure and undefiled, procession of virgins, and moderate fare.2120
What has become of your grave appearance, your gracious demeanour, your plain dress,
meet for a virgin, the beautiful blush of modesty, the comely and bright pallor due to temperance
and vigils, shining fairer than any brilliance of complexion? How often have you
not prayed, perhaps with tears, that you might preserve your virginity without spot! How
often have you not written to the holy men, imploring them to offer up prayers in your behalf,
not that it should be your lot to marry, still less to be involved in this shameful corruption,
but that you should not fall away from the Lord Jesus? How often have you received gifts
from the Bridegroom? Why enumerate the honours given you for His sake by them that
are His? Why tell of your fellowship with virgins, your progress with them, your being
greeted by them with praises on account of virginity, eulogies of virgins, letters written as
to a virgin? Now, nevertheless, at a little blast from the spirit of the air, “that now worketh
in the children of disobedience,”2121 you have abjured all these; you have changed the

honourable treasure, worth fighting for at all costs, for short-lived indulgence which does
for the moment gratify the appetite; one day you will find it more bitter than gall.</p>
<p>3. Who would not grieve over such things and say, “How is the faithful city become an
harlot?”2122 How would not the Lord Himself say to some of those who are now walking
in the spirit of Jeremiah, “Hast thou seen what the virgin of Israel has done to me?”2123 I
betrothed her to me in trust, in purity, in righteousness, in judgment, in pity, and in
mercy;2124 as I promised her through Hosea the prophet. But she loved strangers, and while
I, her husband, was yet alive, she is called adulteress, and is not afraid to belong to another
husband. What then says the conductor of the bride,2125 the divine and blessed Paul, both
that one of old, and the later one of to-day under whose mediation and instruction you left
your father’s house and were united to the Lord? Might not either, in sorrow for such a
trouble, say, “The thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid
of is come unto me.”2126 “I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a
chaste virgin to Christ.”2127 I was indeed ever afraid “lest by any means as the serpent beguiled
Eve through his subtilty, so your mind should be corrupted;”2128 wherefore by
countless counter-charms I strove to control the agitation of your senses, and by countless
safeguards to preserve the bride of the Lord. So I continually set forth the life of the unmarried
maid, and described how “the unmarried” alone “careth for the things of the Lord, that
she may be holy both in body and spirit.”2129 I used to describe the high dignity of virginity,
and, addressing you as a temple of God, used as it were to give wings to your zeal as I strove
to lift you to Jesus. Yet through fear of evil I helped you not to fall by the words “if any man
defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy.”2130 So by my prayers I tried to make you
more secure, if by any means “your body, soul, and spirit might be preserved blameless
unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”2131 Yet all my toil on your behalf has been in
vain. Bitter to me has been the end of those sweet labours. Now I needs must groan again
at that over which I ought to have rejoiced. You have been deceived by the serpent more

last horror has come to pass which I shrink from saying, and yet cannot leave unsaid, for it
is as a burning and blazing fire in my bones, and I am undone and cannot endure. You
have taken the members of Christ and made them the members of a harlot.2132 This is an
evil with which no other can be matched. This outrage in life is new. “For pass over the
Isles of Chittim and see; and send unto Chedar and consider diligently, and see if there be
such a thing. Hath a nation changed their gods which are yet no gods.”2133 But the virgin
has changed her glory, and her glory is in her shame. The heavens are astonished at this,
and the earth is horribly afraid, saith the Lord, for the virgin has committed two evils; she
has forsaken2134 Me, the true and holy Bridegroom of holy souls, and has betaken herself
to an impious and lawless destroyer of body and soul alike. She has revolted from God, her
Saviour, and yielded her members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity.2135 She forgot
me and went after her lover2136 from whom she will get no good.</p>
<p>4. It were better for him that a mill-stone had been hanged about his neck, and that he
had been cast into the sea, than that he should have offended the virgin of the Lord.2137
What slave ever reached such a pitch of mad audacity as to fling himself upon his master’s
bed? What robber ever attained such a height of folly as to lay hands upon the very offerings
of God, not dead vessels, but bodies living and enshrining a soul made after the image of

<p>5. In such a state of things as this, “Shall they fall and not arise? Shall he turn away and
not return?”2143 Why did the virgin turn shamefully away, though she had heard Christ
her bridegroom saying through the mouth of Jeremiah, “And I said, after she had done all
these things (committed all these fornications, LXX.), turn thou unto me, but she returned
not?”2144 “Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? Why then is not the
health of the daughter of my people recovered?”2145 You might indeed find many remedies
for evil in Scripture, many medicines to save from destruction and lead to health; the mysteries
of death and resurrection, the sentences of terrible judgment and everlasting punishment;
the doctrines of repentance and of remission of sins; all the countless illustrations of
conversion, the piece of money, the sheep, the son who wasted his substance with harlots,
who was lost and was found, who was dead and alive again. Let us not use these remedies
for ill; by these means let us heal our soul. Bethink you of your last day, for you will surely
not, unlike all other women, live for ever. The distress, the gasping for breath, the hour of
death, the imminent sentence of God, the angels hastening on their way, the soul fearfully
dismayed, and lashed to agony by the consciousness of sin, turning itself piteously to things
of this life and to the inevitable necessity of that long life to be lived elsewhere. Picture to
me, as it rises in your imagination, the conclusion of all human life, when the Son of God
shall come in His glory with His angels, “For he shall come and shall not keep silence;”2146
when He shall come to judge the quick and dead, to render to every one according to his
work; when that terrible trumpet with its mighty voice shall wake those that have slept
through the ages, and they that have done good shall come forth unto the resurrection of
life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation.2147 Remember the
vision of Daniel, and how he brings the judgment before us: “I beheld till the thrones were
cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair
of His head like the pure wool;…and His wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and

ten thousand stood before Him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened,”2148
clearly disclosing in the hearing of all, angels and men, things good and evil, things done
openly and in secret, deeds, words, and thoughts all at once. What then must those men
be who have lived wicked lives? Where then shall that soul hide which in the sight of all
these spectators shall suddenly be revealed in its fulness of shame? With what kind of body
shall it sustain those endless and unbearable pangs in the place of fire unquenched, and of
the worm that perishes and never dies, and of depth of Hades, dark and horrible; bitter
wailings, loud lamenting, weeping and gnashing of teeth and anguish without end? From
all these woes there is no release after death; no device, no means of coming forth from the
chastisement of pain.</p>
<p>6. We can escape now. While we can, let us lift ourselves from the fall: let us never
despair of ourselves, if only we depart from evil. Jesus Christ came into the world to save
sinners. “O come, let us worship and fall down; let us weep before Him.”2149 The Word
Who invited us to repentance calls aloud, “Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest.”2150 There is, then, a way of salvation, if we will. “Death in
his might has swallowed up, but again the Lord hath wiped away tears from off all faces”2151
of them that repent. The Lord is faithful in all His words.2152 He does not lie when He
says, “Though your sins be scarlet they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like
crimson they shall be as wool.”2153 The great Physician of souls, Who is the ready liberator,
not of you alone, but of all who are enslaved by sin, is ready to heal your sickness. From
Him come the words, it was His sweet and saving lips that said, “They that be whole need
not a physician but they that are sick.<gap reason="omitted"/>I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to
repentance.”2154 What excuse have you, what excuse has any one, when He speaks thus?
The Lord wishes to cleanse you from the trouble of your sickness and to show you light after
darkness. The good Shepherd, Who left them that had not wandered away, is seeking after
you. If you give yourself to Him He will not hold back. He, in His love, will not disdain
even to carry you on His own shoulders, rejoicing that He has found His sheep which was
lost. The Father stands and awaits your return from your wandering. Only come back, and
while you are yet afar off, He will run and fall upon your neck, and, now that you are cleansed

that are His own, both angels and men, and will celebrate your salvation far and wide. For
“verily I say unto you,” says He, “there is joy in heaven before God over one sinner that repenteth.”

<head>Letter XLVII.2157</head>
<head>To Gregory.2158</head>
<p>“Who will give me wings like a dove?2159 Or how can my old age be so renewed that I
can travel to your affection, satisfy my deep longing to see you, tell you all the troubles of
my soul, and get from you some comfort in my affliction? For when the blessed bishop
Eusebius2160 fell asleep, we were under no small alarm lest plotters against the Church of
our Metropolis, wishful to fill it with their heretical tares, should seize the present opportunity,
root out by their wicked teaching the true faith sown by much labour in men’s souls,
and destroy its unity. This has been the result of their action in many churches.2161 When
however I received the letters of the clergy exhorting me not to let their needs be overlooked
<note type="footnote">2157 Placed in 370. The letters numbered 47 to 291, inclusive, are placed by the Benedictine editors during
St. Basil’s episcopate.</note>
<note type="footnote">2158 On this title Benedictine editors remark that no careful reader can fail to note that the letter is written
not by Basil but about Basil. “Hodie,” they write, “inter eruditos fere convenit eam a Gregorio patre, filii manu,
ad Eusebium Samosatensem scriptam fuisse. Nam senem se esse declarat auctor Epistolæ et in Cappadocia Episcopum,
ut qui litteris cleri ad electionem Episcopi, et Ecclesiæ Cæsariensis defesionem invitatus fuerit. Is autem
ad quem scribit et eadem dignitate præditus erat, et laboribus pro Ecclesia susceptis clarus, et amicus Basilio, nec
Cappadociæ vicinus. Omnia in Eusebium Samosatensem mirifice conveniunt, quem Basilii ordinationi scimus
interfuisse,” and they give, moreover, as their descriptive heading: “Gregorius Theologi pater Eusebium Samosatensem,
misso Eustathio diacono, invitat ad electionem Episcopi Cæsariensis ut eo adjuvante Basilius eligi
possit.” Fialon, however, apparently forgetting the reference to old age, writes (Étude Hist. p. 87, n.): “Cette
lettre est évidemment de Grégoire de Nazianze,” meaning the younger. The election of St. Basil, who probably
“voluit episcopari” to the archiepiscopal throne, was indeed mainly due to the intervention of the elder Gregory.
Basil’s unfortunate and indefensible disingenuousness in summoning the younger Gregory to Cæsarea on the
plea of his own severe illness defeated its object. But for the prompt and practical intervention of Gregory the
elder, and this appeal to Eusebius of Samosata, the archbishopric might have fallen into unworthy, or at least
inferior, hands. Vide Biog. Notice in Proleg., .</note>
<note type="footnote">2159 cf. Ps. lv. 6, LXX.</note>
<note type="footnote">2160 Eusebius, at the time of his election an unbaptized layman, was elevated to the throne of Cæsarea on
the death of Dianius in 362. In this case too it was due to the counsels of the elder Gregory that the objections
both of Eusebius and of the bishops, forced by the opposing party to consecrate him, were finally overcome. It
was he who ordained Basil to the presbyterate and chafed against the ascendancy of his more able and brilliant
subordinate.</note>
<note type="footnote">2161 In 365 Valens came to Cæsarea with Arian bishops, and endeavoured to put down the Catholics. Basil
returned from his retreat in order to aid Eusebius in resisting the attack, and seems to have shown much tact
and good feeling as well as vigour and ability. cf. Greg. Naz., Or. xx. 340.</note>

at such a crisis, as I ranged my eyes in all directions I bethought me of your loving spirit,
your right faith, and your unceasing zeal on behalf of the churches of God. I have therefore

to add this one more to all your labours on behalf of the Church. I entreat you also to refresh
my old age by a sight of you; and to maintain for the true Church its famous orthodoxy, by
uniting with me, if I may be deemed worthy of uniting with you, in the good work, to give
it a shepherd in accordance with the will of the Lord, able to guide His people aright. I have

being one of Basil’s deacons is so far in favour of Basil’s having written the letter. But Eustathius was a
common name, and Eustathius, a monk, is mentioned in the will of Gregory of Nazianzus.</note>

<p>I have had considerable difficulty in finding a messenger to convey a letter to your reverence,
for our men are so afraid of the winter that they can hardly bear even to put their
heads outside their houses. We have suffered from such a very heavy fall of snow that we
have been buried, houses and all, beneath it, and now for two months have been living in
dens and caves. You know the Cappadocian character and how hard it is to get us to
move.2165 Forgive me then for not writing sooner and bringing to the knowledge of your
excellency the latest news from Antioch. To tell you all this now, when it is probable that
you learnt it long ago, is stale and uninteresting. But as I do not reckon it any trouble to
tell you even what you know, I have sent you the letters conveyed by the reader. On this
point I shall say no more. Constantinople has now for some time had Demophilus,2166 as
the bearers of this letter will themselves tell you, and as has doubtless been reported to your
holiness. From all who come to us from that city there is unanimously reported about him
a certain counterfeit of orthodoxy and sound religion, to such an extent that even the divided
portions of the city have been brought to agreement, and some of the neighbouring bishops
have accepted the reconciliation. Our men here have not turned out better than I expected.
They came directly you were gone,2167 said and did many painful things, and at last went
home again, after making their separation from me wider.2168 Whether anything better
will happen in the future, and whether they will give up their evil ways, is unknown to all
but God. So much for our present condition. The rest of the Church, by God’s grace, stands

<head>To Bishop Bosporius.2176</head>
<p>How do you think my heart was pained at hearing of the slanders heaped on me by
some of those that feel no fear of the Judge, who “shall destroy them that speak leasing”?2177
I spent nearly the whole night sleepless, thinking of your words of love; so did grief lay hold
upon my heart of hearts. For verily, in the words of Solomon, slander humbleth a man.2178
And no man is so void of feeling as not to be touched at heart, and bowed down to the
ground, if he falls in with lips prone to lying. But we must needs put up with all things and
endure all things, after committing our vindication to the Lord. He will not despise us; for
“he that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker.”2179 They, however, who have patched
up this new tragedy of blasphemy seem to have lost all belief in the Lord, Who has declared
that we must give account at the day of judgment even for an idle word.2180 And I, tell me,
I anathematized the right blessed Dianius? For this is what they have said against me.
Where? When? In whose presence? On what pretext? In mere spoken words, or in writing?
Following others, or myself the author and originator of the deed? Alas for the impudence
of men who make no difficulty at saying anything! Alas for their contempt of the judgment
of God! Unless, indeed, they add this further to their fiction, that they make me out to have
been once upon a time so far out of my mind as not to know what I was saying. For so long
as I have been in my senses I know that I never did anything of the kind, or had the least
wish to do so. What I am, indeed, conscious of is this; that from my earliest childhood I
was brought up in love for him, thought as I gazed at him how venerable he looked, how
dignified, how truly reverend. Then when I grew older I began to know him by the good
qualities of his soul, and took delight in his society, gradually learning to perceive the simplicity,
nobility, and liberality of his character, and all his most distinctive qualities, his
gentleness of soul, his mingled magnanimity and meekness, the seemliness of his conduct,
his control of temper, the beaming cheerfulness and affability which he combined with

<p>However, towards the close of his life (I will not conceal the truth) I, together with many
of them that in our country2181 feared the Lord, sorrowed over him with sorrow unendurable,
because he signed the creed brought from Constantinople by George.2182 Afterwards, full
of kindness and gentleness as he was, and willing out of the fulness of his fatherly heart to
give satisfaction to everyone, when he had already fallen sick of the disease of which he died,
he sent for me, and, calling the Lord to witness, said that in the simplicity of his heart he
had agreed to the document sent from Constantinople, but had had no idea of rejecting the
creed put forth by the holy Fathers at Nicæa, nor had had any other disposition of heart
than from the beginning he had always had. He prayed, moreover, that he might not be cut
off from the lot of those blessed three hundred and eighteen bishops who had announced
the pious decree2183 to the world. In consequence of this satisfactory statement I dismissed
all anxiety and doubt, and, as you are aware, communicated with him, and gave over
grieving. Such have been my relations with Dianius. If anyone avers that he is privy to any
vile slander on my part against Dianius, do not let him buzz it slave-wise in a corner; let

<head>Letter LII.2184</head>
<head>To the Canonicæ.2185</head>
<p>1. I have been very much distressed by a painful report which reached my ears; but I
have been equally delighted by my brother, beloved of God, bishop Bosporius,2186 who has
brought a more satisfactory account of you. He avers by God’s grace that all those stories
spread abroad about you are inventions of men who are not exactly informed as to the truth
about you. He added, moreover, that he found among you impious calumnies about me,
of a kind likely to be uttered by those who do not expect to have to give the Judge in the day
of His righteous retribution an account of even an idle word. I thank God, then, both because
I am cured of my damaging opinion of you, an opinion which I have derived from the
calumnies of men, and because I have heard of your abandonment of those baseless notions
about me, on hearing the assurances of my brother. He, in all that he has said as coming
from himself, has also completely expressed my own feeling. For in us both there is one
mind about the faith, as being heirs of the same Fathers who once at Nicæa promulgated
their great decree2187 concerning the faith. Of this, some portions are universally accepted
without cavil, but the homoousion, ill received in certain quarters, is still rejected by some.
These objectors we may very properly blame, and yet on the contrary deem them deserving
of pardon. To refuse to follow the Fathers, not holding their declaration of more authority
than one’s own opinion, is conduct worthy of blame, as being brimful of self-sufficiency.
On the other hand the fact that they view with suspicion a phrase which is misrepresented
by an opposite party does seem to a small extent to relieve them from blame. Moreover, as
a matter of fact, the members of the synods which met to discuss the case of Paul of Samosata2188
did find fault with the term as an unfortunate one.</p>

charity, and living apart from men, though not under vows, nor always in a coenobium. In Soc., H.E.i. 17 they
are described as the recipients of St. Helena’s hospitality. St. Basil is supposed to refuse to recognise marriage
with them as legitimate in Ep. cclxxxviii. The word κανονικῶν may stand for either gender, but the marriage
of Canonici was commonly allowed. Letter clxxiii. is addressed to the canonica Theodora.</note>

against Paul of Samosata appeal was made to the pagan Aurelian. On the explanation of how the Homoousion
came to be condemned in one sense by the Origenist bishops at Antioch in 269, and asserted in another by the
318 at Nicæa in 325, see prolegomena to Athanasius in Schaff and Wace’s ed. p. xxxi. cf. Ath.,De Syn. § 45, Hil.,
De Trin. iv. 4, and Basil, Cont. Eunom. i. 19. “Wurde seiner Lehre: ‘Gott sey mit dem Logos zugleich Eine Person,</note>

<pb n="465"/>
<p>For they maintained that the homoousion set forth the idea both of essence and of what
is derived from it, so that the essence, when divided, confers the title of co-essential on the
parts into which it is divided. This explanation has some reason in the case of bronze and
coins made therefrom, but in the case of God the Father and God the Son there is no question
of substance anterior or even underlying both; the mere thought and utterance of such a
thing is the last extravagance of impiety. What can be conceived of as anterior to the Unbegotten?
By this blasphemy faith in the Father and the Son is destroyed, for things, constituted
out of one, have to one another the relation of brothers.</p>
<p>2. Because even at that time there were men who asserted the Son to have been brought
into being out of the non-existent, the term homoousion was adopted, to extirpate this impiety.
For the conjunction of the Son with the Father is without time and without interval.
The preceding words shew this to have been the intended meaning. For after saying that
the Son was light of light, and begotten of the substance of the Father, but was not made,
they went on to add the homoousion, thereby showing that whatever proportion of light
any one would attribute in the case of the Father will obtain also in that of the Son. For very
light in relation to very light, according to the actual sense of light, will have no variation.
Since then the Father is light without beginning, and the Son begotten light, but each of
Them light and light; they rightly said “of one substance,” in order to set forth the equal
dignity of the nature. Things, that have a relation of brotherhood, are not, as some persons
have supposed, of one substance; but when both the cause and that which derives its natural

<p>3. This term also corrects the error of Sabellius, for it removes the idea of the identity
of the hypostases, and introduces in perfection the idea of the Persons. For nothing can be
of one substance with itself, but one thing is of one substance with another. The word has
therefore an excellent and orthodox use, defining as it does both the proper character of the
hypostases, and setting forth the invariability of the nature. And when we are taught that
the Son is of the substance of the Father, begotten and not made, let us not fall into the
material sense of the relations. For the substance was not separated from the Father and
bestowed on the Son; neither did the substance engender by fluxion, nor yet by shooting

forth2189 as plants their fruits. The mode of the divine begetting is ineffable and inconceivable
by human thought. It is indeed characteristic of poor and carnal intelligence to compare
the things that are eternal with the perishing things of time, and to imagine, that as corporeal
things beget, so does God in like manner; it is rather our duty to rise to the truth by arguments
of the contrary, and to say, that since thus is the mortal, not thus is He who is immortal.
We must neither then deny the divine generation, nor contaminate our intelligence with
corporeal senses.</p>
<p>4. The Holy Spirit, too, is numbered with the Father and the Son, because He is above
creation, and is ranked as we are taught by the words of the Lord in the Gospel, “Go and
baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.”2190 He who, on
the contrary, places the Spirit before the Son, or alleges Him to be older than the Father,
resists the ordinance of God, and is a stranger to the sound faith, since he fails to preserve
the form of doxology which he has received, but adopts some new fangled device in order
to be pleasing to men. It is written “The Spirit is of God,”2191 and if He is of God, how can
He be older than that of which He is? And what folly is it not, when there is one Unbegotten,
to speak of something else as superior to the Unbegotten? He is not even anterior, for
nothing intervenes between Son and Father. If, however, He is not of God but is through
Christ, He does not even exist at all. It follows, that this new invention about the order
really involves the destruction of the actual existence, and is a denial of the whole faith. It
is equally impious to reduce Him to the level of a creature, and to subordinate Him either
to Son or to Father, either in time or in rank. These are the points on which I have heard
that you are making enquiry. If the Lord grant that we meet I may possibly have more to
say on these subjects, and may myself, concerning points which I am investigating, receive
satisfactory information from you.</p>

<p>1. My soul is deeply pained at the enormity of the matter on which I write, if for this
only, that it has caused general suspicion and talk. But so far it has seemed to me incredible.
I hope then that what I am writing about it may be taken by the guilty as medicine, by the
innocent as a warning, by the indifferent, in which class I trust none of you may be found,
as a testimony. And what is it of which I speak? There is a report that some of you take
money from candidates for ordination,2194 and excuse it on grounds of religion. This is
indeed worse. If any one does evil under the guise of good he deserves double punishment;
because he not only does what is in itself not good, but, so to say, makes good an accomplice
in the commission of sin. If the allegation be true, let it be so no more. Let a better state of
things begin. To the recipient of the bribe it must be said, as was said by the Apostles to
him who was willing to give money to buy the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, “Thy money
perish with thee.2195 It is a lighter sin to wish in ignorance to buy, than it is to sell, the gift
of God. A sale it was; and if you sell what you received as a free gift you will be deprived of
the boon, as though you were yourself sold to Satan. You are obtruding the traffic of the
huckster into spiritual things and into the Church where we are entrusted with the body
and blood of Christ. These things must not be. And I will mention wherein lies an ingenious
contrivance. They think that there is no sin because they take the money not before but
after the ordination; but to take is to take at whatever time.</p>

<head>To the Chorepiscopi.</head>
<p>I am much distressed that the canons of the Fathers have fallen through, and that the
exact discipline of the Church has been banished from among you. I am apprehensive lest,
as this indifference grows, the affairs of the Church should, little by little, fall into confusion.
According to the ancient custom observed in the Churches of God, ministers in the Church
were received after careful examination; the whole of their life was investigated; an enquiry
was made as to their being neither railers nor drunkards, not quick to quarrel, keeping their
youth in subjection, so as to be able to maintain “the holiness without which no man shall
see the Lord.”2200 This examination was made by presbyters and deacons living with them.
Then they brought them to the Chorepiscopi; and the Chorepiscopi, after receiving the
suffrages of the witnesses as to the truth and giving information to the Bishop, so admitted
the minister to the sacerdotal order.2201 Now, however, you have quite passed me over;
you have not even had the grace to refer to me, and have transferred the whole authority to
yourselves. Furthermore, with complete indifference, you have allowed presbyters and
deacons to introduce unworthy persons into the Church, just any one they choose, without
any previous examination of life and character, by mere favoritism, on the score of relationship
or some other tie. The consequence is, that in every village, there are reckoned many

supply proof from your difficulty in finding suitable candidates for election. As, then, I
perceive that the evil is gradually reaching a point at which it would be incurable, and especially
at this moment when a large number of persons are presenting themselves for the
ministry through fear of the conscription, I am constrained to have recourse to the restitution
of the canons of the Fathers. I thus order you in writing to send me the roll of the ministers
in every village, stating by whom each has been introduced, and what is his mode of life.
You have the roll in your own keeping, so that your version can be compared with the
documents which are in mine, and no one can insert his own name when he likes. So if any
have been introduced by presbyters after the first appointment,2202 let them be rejected,
and take their place among the laity. Their examination must then be begun by you over
again, and, if they prove worthy, let them be received by your decision. Drive out unworthy
men from the Church, and so purge it. For the future, test by examination those who are
worthy, and then receive them; but do not reckon them of the number before you have reported
to me. Otherwise, distinctly understand that he who is admitted to the ministry
without my authority will remain a layman.</p>

<head>To Paregorius, the presbyter.</head>
<p>I have given patient attention to your letter, and I am astonished that when you are
perfectly well able to furnish me with a short and easy defence by taking action at once, you
should choose to persist in what is my ground of complaint, and endeavour to cure the incurable
by writing a long story about it. I am not the first, Paregorius, nor the only man, to
lay down the law that women are not to live with men. Read the canon put forth by our
holy Fathers at the Council of Nicæa, which distinctly forbids subintroducts. Unmarried
life is honourably distinguished by its being cut off from all female society. If, then, any
one, who is known by the outward profession, in reality follows the example of those who
live with wives, it is obvious that he only affects the distinction of virginity in name, and
does not hold aloof from unbecoming indulgence. You ought to have been all the more
ready to submit yourself without difficulty to my demands, in that you allege that you are
free from all bodily appetite. I do not suppose that a man of three score years and ten lives
with a woman from any such feelings, and I have not decided, as I have decided, on the
ground of any crime having been committed. But we have learnt from the Apostle, not to
put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in a brother’s way;”2204 and I know that what
is done very properly by some, naturally becomes to others an occasion for sin. I have
therefore given my order, in obedience to the injunction of the holy Fathers, that you are
to separate from the woman. Why then, do you find fault with the Chorepiscopus? What
is the good of mentioning ancient ill-will? Why do you blame me for lending an easy ear
to slander? Why do you not rather lay the blame on yourself, for not consenting to break
off your connexion with the woman? Expel her from your house, and establish her in a
monastery. Let her live with virgins, and do you be served by men, that the name of God
be not blasphemed in you. Till you have so done, the innumerable arguments, which you
use in your letters, will not do you the slightest service. You will die useless, and you will
have to give an account to God for your uselessness. If you persist in clinging to your clerical
position without correcting your ways, you will be accursed before all the people, and
all, who receive you, will be excommunicate throughout the Church.2205</p>

You are only discharging your proper obligation in this. For really, although this letter of
mine is a return for a previous one of yours, as it is more than twice as bulky, it will fulfil a
double purpose. You see to what sophisms my idleness drives me. But, my dear Sir, do not

friends, and neglect of them arising from high place, are faults which involve every kind of
wrong. Do we fail to love according to the commandment of the Lord? Then we lose the
distinctive mark imprinted on us. Are we puffed to repletion with empty pride and arrogance?
Then we fall into the inevitable condemnation of the devil. If, then, you use these
words because you held such sentiments about me, pray that I may flee from the wickedness
which you have found in my ways; if, however, your tongue shaped itself to these words, in

faulty character.</p>

nay, you would have written me many letters on each occasion, knowing the reward that is
kept in store by our loving Lord for the consolation of the afflicted. Everything here is still
in a very painful condition, and the thought of your holiness is the only thing that recalls
me from my own troubles; a thought made more distinct to me by my communication with
you through that letter of yours which is so full of wisdom and grace. When, therefore, I
take your letter into my hand, first of all, I look at its size, and I love it all the more for being
so big; then, as I read it, I rejoice over every word I find in it; as I draw near the end I begin
to feel sad; so good is every word that I read, in what you write. The overflowing of a good
heart is good. Should I, however, be permitted, in answer to your prayers, while I live on
this earth, to meet you face to face, and to enjoy the profitable instruction of your living
voice, or any aids to help me in the life that now is, or that which is to come, I should count
this indeed the best of blessings, a prelude to the mercy of God. I should, ere now, have

forged one letter, and brought it me as though it came from our right reverend uncle the
bishop, trying to deceive me, I have no idea why. I received it as a letter written by the
bishop and delivered by you. Why should I not? I was delighted; I shewed it to many of
my friends; I thanked God. The forgery was found out, on the bishop’s repudiating it in
person. I was thoroughly ashamed; covered as I was with the disgrace of cunning trickery
and lies, I prayed that the earth might open for me. Then they gave me a second letter, as
sent by the bishop himself by the hands of your servant Asterius. Even this second had not
really been sent by the bishop, as my very reverend brother Anthimus2213 has told me. Now
Adamantius has come bringing me a third. How ought I to receive a letter carried by you

I to think, now that, after my first and second experience, I can admit nothing without
positive proof? Thus I write attacking your simplicity, which I see plainly to be neither what
generally becomes a Christian man, nor is appropriate to the present emergency; I write
that, at least for the future, you may take care of yourself and spare me. I must speak to you

whoever be the writer of the letter, I have answered as is fit . Whether, then, you
yourself are experimenting on me, or whether really the letter which you have sent is one
which you have received from the bishops, you have my answer. At such a time as this you
ought to have borne in mind that you are my brother, and have not yet forgotten the ties of

further endure to enforce against myself the hardest punishment of silence, by neither
writing myself, nor receiving any statement from another? By holding fast to this stern determination
up to the present time I am able to apply to myself the prophet’s words, “I endure
patiently like travailing woman.”2219 Yet I am ever longing for communication either in
person or by letter, and ever, for my own sins’ sake, missing it. For I cannot imagine any
reason for what is happening, other than what I am convinced is the true one, that by being
cut off from your love I am expiating old sins; if indeed I am not wrong in using such a
phrase as “cut off” in your case, from any one, much less from me, to whom you have always
been as a father. Now my sin, like some dense cloud overshadowing me, has made me forget
all this. When I reflect that the only result to me of what is going on is sorrow, how can I
attribute it to anything but to my own wickedness? But if events are to be traced to sins, be
this the end of my troubles; if there was any intended discipline in it, then your object has
been very completely attained, for the punishment has been going on for a long time; so I
groan no longer, but am the first to break silence, and beseech you to remember both me
and yourself who, to a greater degree than our relationship might have demanded, have
shewn me strong affection all my life. Now, I implore you, show kindness to the city for
my sake. Do not on my account alienate yourself from it.</p>
<p>2. If, then, there is any consolation in Christ, any fellowship of the Spirit, any mercy
and pity, fulfil my prayer. Put a stop to my depression. Let there be a beginning of brighter
things for the future. Be yourself a leader to others in the road to all that is best, and follow

body as gentleness and peace are of your soul. It were well becoming such a one as you are
to draw all others to yourself, and to cause all who come near you to be permeated with the
goodness of your nature, as with the fragrance of myrrh. For though there be a certain
amount of opposition now, nevertheless ere long there will be a recognition of the blessings
of peace. So long, however, as room is found for the calumnies that are bred of dissension,
suspicion is sure to grow from worse to worse. It is most certainly unbecoming for the rest
to take no notice of me, but it is especially unbecoming in your excellency. If I am wrong

I shall be all the better for being rebuked. This is impossible if we never meet. But, if I am
doing no wrong, for what am I disliked? So much I offer in my own defence.</p>
<p>3. As to what the Churches might say in their own behalf, perhaps it is better for me to
be silent: they reap the result of our disagreement, and it is not to their gain. I am not
speaking to indulge my grief but to put a stop to it. And your intelligence, I am sure, has
suffered nothing to escape you. You will yourself be better able to discern and to tell to
others points of far greater importance than I can conceive. You saw the mischief done to
the Churches before I did; and you are grieving more than I am, for you have long learnt
from the Lord not to despise even the least.2220 And now the mischief is not confined to
one or two, but whole cities and peoples are sharers in my calamities. What need to tell
what kind of report will spread about me even beyond our borders? It were well for you,
large hearted as you are, to leave the love of strife to others; nay rather, if it be possible, to
root it from their hearts, while you yourself vanquish what is grievous by endurance. Any
angry man can defend himself, but to rise above the actual anger belongs only to you, and
any one as good as you, if such there be. One thing I will not say, that he who has a grudge
against me is letting his anger fall on the innocent. Do then comfort my soul by coming to
me, or by a letter, or by inviting me to come to you, or by some means or other. My prayer
is that your piety may be seen in the Church and that you may heal at once me and the
people, both by the sight of you and by the words of your good grace. If this be possible it
is best; if you determine on any other course I shall willingly accept it. Only accede to my
entreaty that you will give me distinct information as to what your wisdom decides.</p>

<p>Formerly I was glad to see my brother. Why not, since he is my brother and such a
brother? Now I have received him on his coming to visit me with the same feelings, and
have lost none of my affection. God forbid that I should ever so feel as to forget the ties of
nature and be at war with those who are near and dear to me. I have found his presence a
comfort in my bodily sickness and the other troubles of my soul, and I have been especially
delighted at the letter which he has brought me from your excellency. For a long time I
have been hoping that it would come, for this only reason, that I need not add to my life
any doleful episode of quarrel between kith and kin, sure to give pleasure to foes and sorrow
to friends, and to be displeasing to God, Who has laid down perfect love as the distinctive
characteristic of His disciples. So I reply, as I am indeed bound, with an earnest request for
your prayers for me, and your care for me in all things, as your relative. Since I, from want
of information, cannot clearly understand the meaning of what is going on, I have judged
it right to accept the truth of the account which you are so good as to give me. It is for you
of your wisdom to settle the rest, our meeting with one another, the fitting time and a convenient
place. If your reverence really does not disdain to come down to my lowliness and
to have speech with me, whether you wish the interview to take place in the presence of
others or in private, I shall make no objection, for I have once for all made up my mind to
submit to you in love, and to carry out, without exception, what your reverence enjoins on
me for the glory of God.</p>

<p>I have read the letter of your holiness, in which you have expressed your distress at the
unhappy governor of Libya. I am grieved that my own country should have given birth to
and nurtured such vices. I am grieved too that Libya, a neighbouring country, should suffer
from our evils, and should have been delivered to the inhumanity of a man whose life is
marked at once by cruelty and crime. This however is only in accordance with the wisdom
of the Preacher, “Woe to thee O land when thy King is a child;”2224 (a still further touch of
trouble) and whose “Princes” do not “eat” after night but revel at mid-day, raging after
other men’s wives with less understanding than brute beasts. This man must surely look
for the scourges of the righteous Judge, repaid him in exact requital for those which he
himself has previously inflicted on the saints. Notice has been given to my Church in accordance
with the letter of your reverence, and he shall be held by all as abominable, cut off
from fire, water and shelter, if indeed in the case of men so possessed there is any use in
general and unanimous condemnation. Notoriety is enough for him, and your own letter,
which has been read in all directions, for I shall not fail to show it to all his friends and rel-
atives. Assuredly, even if retribution does not reach him at once, as it did Pharaoh, certainly
it will bring on him hereafter a heavy and hard requital.</p>

this letter to you. I feel with you at once in your grief at the event which has befallen you,

So says the tragedian Euripides. And so, if, though I have never had the pleasure of meeting
your excellency in person, I speak of myself as a familiar friend, pray do not set this down
to mere empty compliment. Common report, which loudly proclaims your universal benevolence,
is, in this instance, the promoter of friendship. Indeed since I met the highly respectable
Elpidius,2229 I have known you as well, and I have been as completely captured
by you, as though I had long lived with you and had practical experience of your excellent
qualities. For he did not cease telling me about you, mentioning one by one your magnanimity,
your exalted sentiments, your mild manners, your skill in business, intelligence, dignity
tempered by cheerfulness, and eloquence. All the other points that he enumerated in his
long conversation with me it is impossible for me to write to you, without extending my
letter beyond all reasonable bounds. How can I fail to love such a man? How could I put
such restraint upon myself as not loudly to proclaim what I feel? Accept then, most excellent
Sir, the greeting which I send you, for it is inspired by true and unfeigned friendship. I abhor

persistently to your evil counsel of inaction, what end will there be to our silence? However,
where friendship is involved, to be defeated is in my opinion to win, and so I am quite ready
to gave you precedence, and retire from the contest as to which should maintain his own
opinion. I have been the first to betake myself to writing, because I know that “charity
beareth all things…endureth all things<gap reason="omitted"/>seeketh not her own” and so “never faileth.”2234
He who subjects himself to his neighbour in love can never be humiliated. I do beg you,
then, at all events for the future, show the first and greatest fruit of the Spirit, Love;2235 away
with the angry man’s sullenness which you are showing me by your silence, and recover joy
in your heart, peace with the brothers who are of one mind with you, and zeal and anxiety
for the continued safety of the Churches of the Lord. If I were not to make as strenuous

idea that you need communion with no one else. To cut one’s self off from connexion with

commandment of Christ. At the same time I do wish you, with all your good intentions,

<head>To Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria.</head>
<p>No one, I feel sure, is more distressed at the present condition, or, rather to speak more
truly, ill condition of the Churches than your excellency; for you compare the present with
the past, and take into account how great a change has come about. You are well aware that
if no check is put to the swift deterioration which we are witnessing, there will soon be
nothing to prevent the complete transformation of the Churches. And if the decay of the
Churches seems so pitiful to me, what must—so I have often in my lonely musings reflected—
be the feelings of one who has known, by experience, the old tranquillity of the Churches
of the Lord, and their one mind about the faith? But as your excellency feels most deeply
this distress, it seems to me only becoming that your wisdom should be more strongly moved
to interest itself in the Church’s behalf. I for my part have long been aware, so far as my
moderate intelligence has been able to judge of current events, that the one way of safety
for the Churches of the East lies in their having the sympathy of the bishops of the West.
For if only those bishops liked to show the same energy on behalf of the Christians sojourning
in our part of the world2238 which they have shewn in the case of one or two of the men
convicted of breaches of orthodoxy in the West, our common interests would probably reap
no small benefit, our sovereigns treating the authority of the people with respect, and the
laity in all quarters unhesitatingly following them.2239 But, to carry out these objects, who
has more capacity than yourself, with your intelligence and prudence? Who is keener to
see the needful course to be taken? Who has more practical experience in working a profitable
policy? Who feels more deeply the troubles of the brethren? What through all the
West is more honoured than your venerable gray hairs?2240 O most honoured father, leave
behind you some memorial worthy of your life and character. By this one act crown your
innumerable efforts on behalf of true religion. Despatch from the holy Church placed under
your care men of ability in sound doctrine to the bishops in the West. Recount to them the
troubles whereby we are beset. Suggest some mode of relief. Be a Samuel to the Churches.

Share the grief of the beleaguered people. Offer prayers for peace. Ask favour from the
Lord, that He will send some memorial of peace to the Churches. I know how weak letters
are to move men in matters of such importance; but you yourself no more need exhortation
from others than the noblest athletes need the children’s cheers. It is not as though I were
instructing one in ignorance; I am only giving a new impulse to one whose energies are
already roused. For the rest of the affairs of the East perhaps you may need the aid of more,
and we must wait for the Westerns. But plainly the discipline of the Church of Antioch
depends upon your reverence’s being able to control some, to reduce others to silence, and
to restore strength to the Church by concord.2241 No one knows better than you do, that,
like all wise physicians, you ought to begin your treatment in the most vital parts, and what
part is more vital to the Churches throughout the world than Antioch? Only let Antioch
be restored to harmony, and nothing will stand in the way of her supplying, as a healthy
head, soundness to all the body. Truly the diseases of that city, which has not only been cut
asunder by heretics, but is torn in pieces by men who say that they are of one mind with
one another, stand in need of your wisdom and evangelic sympathy. To unite the sundered
parts again, and bring about the harmony of one body, belongs to Him alone Who by His
ineffable power grants even to the dry bones to come back again to sinews and flesh. But
the Lord always works His mighty works by means of them that are worthy of Him. Once
again, in this case too, we trust that the ministry of matters so important may beseem your
excellency, with the result that you will lay the tempest of the people, do away with the party
superiorities, and subject all to one another in love, and give back to the Church her ancient
strength.</p>

that portion of the people of the holy Church of Antioch who are sound in the faith, ought
to be brought to concord and unity. My object was to make it plain that the sections, now
divided into several parts, ought to be united under the God-beloved bishop Meletius. Now
the same beloved deacon, Dorotheus, has requested a more distinct statement on these
subjects, and I am therefore constrained to point out that it is the prayer of the whole East,
and the earnest desire of one who, like myself, is so wholly united to him, to see him in authority
over the Churches of the Lord. He is a man of unimpeachable faith; his manner of
life is incomparably excellent, he stands at the head, so to say, of the whole body of the
Church, and all else are mere disjointed members. On every ground, then, it is necessary
as well as advantageous, that the rest should be united with him, just as smaller streams with
great ones. About the rest,2243 however, a certain amount of management is needed, befitting
their position, and likely to pacify the people. This is in keeping with your own wisdom,
and with your famous readiness and energy. It has however by no means escaped your intelligence,

the object of keeping him until the end of the negociations, and so by him acquainting your
excellency with every detail. But day after day went by; the delay was becoming protracted;
now, the moment that some plan, so far as is possible in my difficulties, has occurred to me
concerning the course to be taken, I send him to approach your holiness, to make a personal
report to you on all the circumstances, and show you my memorandum, to the end that, if
what has occurred to me seems to you to be likely to be of service, your excellency may urge
on its accomplishment. To be brief, the opinion has prevailed that it is best for this our
brother Dorotheus to travel to Rome, to move some of the Italians to undertake a voyage
by sea to visit us, that they may avoid all who would put difficulties in their way. My reason
for this course is that I see that those, who are all powerful with the Emperor, are neither
willing nor able to make any suggestion to him about the exiled, but only count it so much
to the good that they see no worse thing befalling the Churches. If, then, my plan seems
good also to your prudence, you will be good enough both to indite letters and dictate
memoranda as to the points on which he must enlarge, and as to whom he had better address
himself. And so that your despatches may have weight and authority, you will add all those
who share your sentiments, even though they are not on the spot. Here all is uncertain;

<head>To Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria.</head>
<p>1. As time moves on, it continually confirms the opinion which I have long held of your
holiness; or rather that opinion is strengthened by the daily course of events. Most men are
indeed satisfied with observing, each one, what lies especially within his own province; not
thus is it with you, but your anxiety for all the Churches is no less than that which you feel
for the Church that has been especially entrusted to you by our common Lord; inasmuch
as you leave no interval in speaking, exhorting, writing, and despatching emissaries, who
from time to time give the best advice in each emergency as it arises. Now, from the sacred
ranks of your clergy, you have sent forth the venerable brother Peter, whom I have welcomed
with great joy. I have also approved of the good object of his journey, which he manifests
in accordance with the commands of your excellency, in effecting reconciliation where he
finds opposition, and bringing about union instead of division. With the object of offering
some contribution to the action which is being taken in this matter, I have thought that I
could not make a more fitting beginning than by having recourse to your excellency, as to
the head and chief of all, and treating you as alike adviser and commander in the enterprise.
I have therefore determined to send to your reverence our brother Dorotheus the deacon,
of the Church under the right honourable bishop Meletius, being one who at once is an
energetic supporter of the orthodox faith, and is earnestly desirous of seeing the peace of
the Churches. The results, I hope, will be, that, following your suggestions (which you are
able to make with the less likelihood of failure, both from your age and your experience in
affairs, and because you have a greater measure than all others of the aid of the Spirit), he
may thus attempt the achievement of our objects. You will welcome him, I am sure, and
will look upon him with friendly eyes. You will strengthen him by the help of your prayers;
you will give him a letter as provision by the way; you will grant him, as companions, some
of the good men and true that you have about you; so you will speed him on the road to
what is before him. It has seemed to me to be desirable to send a letter to the bishop of
Rome, begging him to examine our condition, and since there are difficulties in the way of
representatives being sent from the West by a general synodical decree, to advise him to
exercise his own personal authority in the matter by choosing suitable persons to sustain
the labours of a journey,—suitable, too, by gentleness and firmness of character, to correct
the unruly among us here; able to speak with proper reserve and appropriateness, and
thoroughly well acquainted with all that has been effected after Ariminum to undo the violent
measures adopted there. I should advise that, without any one knowing anything about it,
<note type="footnote">2246 Of the same period as the preceding.</note>

<pb n="490"/>
they should travel hither, attracting as little attention as possible, by the sea, with the object
of escaping the notice of the enemies of peace.</p>
<p>2. A point also that is insisted upon by some of those in these parts, very necessarily,
as is plain even to myself, is that they2247 should drive away the heresy of Marcellus,2248 as
grievous and injurious and opposed to the sound faith. For up to this time, in all the letters
which they write, they are constant in thoroughly anathematizing the ill-famed Arius and
in repudiating him from the Churches. But they attach no blame to Marcellus, who propounded
a heresy diametrically opposite to that of Arius, and impiously attacked the very
existence of the Only begotten Godhead, and erroneously understood the term “Word.”2249
He grants indeed that the Only begotten was called “Word,” on coming forth at need and
in season, but states that He returned again to Him whence He had come forth, and had no
existence before His coming forth, nor hypostasis2250 after His return. The books in my
possession which contain his unrighteous writings exist as a proof of what I say. Nevertheless
they nowhere openly condemned him, and are to this extent culpable that, being from the
first in ignorance of the truth, they received him into the communion of the Church. The
present state of affairs makes it specially necessary that attention should be called to him,
so that those who seek for their opportunity, may be prevented from getting it, from the
fact of sound men being united to your holiness, and all who are lame in the true faith may
be openly known; that so we may know who are on our side, and may not struggle, as in a
night battle, without being able to distinguish between friends and foes. Only I do beseech
you that the deacon, whom I have mentioned, be despatched by the earliest possible packet,
that at least some of the ends which we pray for may be accomplished during the ensuing
year. One thing, however, even before I mention it, you quite understand and I am sure

<p>To renew laws of ancient love, and once again to restore to vigorous life that heavenly
and saving gift of Christ which in course of time has withered away, the peace, I mean, of
the Fathers, is a labour necessary indeed and profitable to me, but pleasant too, as I am sure
it will seem to your Christ-loving disposition. For what could be more delightful than to
behold all, who are separated by distances so vast, bound together by the union effected by
love into one harmony of members in Christ’s body? Nearly all the East (I include under
this name all the regions from Illyricum to Egypt) is being agitated, right honourable father,
by a terrible storm and tempest. The old heresy, sown by Arius the enemy of the truth, has
now boldly and unblushingly reappeared. Like some sour root, it is producing its deadly
fruit and is prevailing. The reason of this is, that in every district the champions of right
doctrine have been exiled from their Churches by calumny and outrage, and the control of
affairs has been handed over to men who are leading captive the souls of the simpler brethren.
I have looked upon the visit of your mercifulness as the only possible solution of our difficulties.
Ever in the past I have been consoled by your extraordinary affection; and for a
short time my heart was cheered by the gratifying report that we shall be visited by you.
But, as I was disappointed, I have been constrained to beseech you by letter to be moved to
help us, and to send some of those, who are like minded with us, either to conciliate the
dissentient and bring back the Churches of God into friendly union, or at all events to make
you see more plainly who are responsible for the unsettled state in which we are, that it may
be obvious to you for the future with whom it befits you to be in communion. In this I am
by no means making any novel request, but am only asking what has been customary in the
case of men who, before our own day, were blessed and dear to God, and conspicuously in
your own case. For I well remember learning from the answers made by our fathers when
asked, and from documents still preserved among us, that the illustrious and blessed bishop
Dionysius, conspicuous in your see as well for soundness of faith as for all other virtues,
visited by letter my Church of Cæsarea, and by letter exhorted our fathers, and sent men to
ransom our brethren from captivity.2253 But now our condition is yet more painful and

buildings, but the capture of Churches; what we see before us is no mere bodily slavery, but
a carrying away of souls into captivity, perpetrated day by day by the champions of heresy.

<head>Basil to Gregory.2255</head>
<p>1. I have received the letter of your holiness, by the most reverend brother Helenius,
and what you have intimated he has told me in plain terms. How I felt on hearing it, you
cannot doubt at all. However, since I have determined that my affection for you shall outweigh
my pain, whatever it is, I have accepted it as I ought to do, and I pray the holy God,
that my remaining days or hours may be as carefully conducted in their disposition towards
you as they have been in past time, during which, my conscience tells me, I have been
wanting to you in nothing small or great. <del>But that the man who boasts that he is now just
beginning to take a look at the life of Christians, and thinks he will get some credit by having
something to do with me, should invent what he has not heard, and narrate what he has
never experienced, is not at all surprising. What is surprising and extraordinary is that he
has got my best friends among the brethren at Nazianzus to listen to him; and not only to
listen to him, but as it seems, to take in what he says. On most grounds it might be surprising
that the slanderer is of such a character, and that I am the victim, but these troublous times
have taught us to bear everything with patience. Slights greater than this have, for my sins,
long been things of common occurrence with me. I have never yet given this man’s brethren
any evidence of my sentiments2256 about God, and I have no answer to make now. Men
who are not convinced by long experience are not likely to be convinced by a short letter.
If the former is enough let the charges of the slanderers be counted as idle tales. But if I give
license to unbridled mouths, and uninstructed hearts, to talk about whom they will, all the
while keeping my ears ready to listen, I shall not be alone in hearing what is said by other
people; they will have to hear what I have to say.</del></p>
<p>2. I know what has led to all this, and have urged every topic to hinder it; but now I am
sick of the subject, and will say no more about it, I mean our little intercourse. For had we
kept our old promise to each other, and had due regard to the claims which the Churches
have on us, we should have been the greater part of the year together; and then there would
have been no opening for these calumniators. Pray have nothing to say to them; let me

<p>I know your affection for me, and your zeal for all that is good. I am exceedingly anxious
to pacify my very dear son Callisthenes, and I thought that if I could associate you with me
in this I might more easily achieve my object. Callisthenes is very much annoyed at the
conduct of Eustochius, and he has very good ground for being so. He charges the household
of Eustochius with impudence and violence against himself. I am begging him to be propitiated,
satisfied with the fright which he has given the impudent fellows and their master,
and to forgive, and end the quarrel. Thus two results will follow; he will win the respect of
men, and praise with God, if only he will combine forbearance with threats. If you have
any friendship and intimacy with him, pray ask this favour of him, and, if you know any in

<head>Letter LXXIII.2259</head>
<head>To Callisthenes.</head>
<p>1. When I had read your letter I thanked God; first, that I been greeted by a man desirous
of doing me honour, for truly I highly estimate any intercourse with persons of high merit;
secondly, with pleasure at the thought of being remembered. For a letter is a sign of remembrance;
and when I had received yours and learnt its contents I was astonished to find how,
as all were agreed, it paid me the respect due to a father from a son. That a man in the heat
of anger and indignation, eager to punish those who had annoyed him, should drop more
than half his vehemence and give me authority to decide the matter, caused me to feel such
joy as I might over a son in the spirit. In return, what remains for me but to pray for all
blessings for you? May you be a delight to your friends, a terror to your foes, an object of
respect to all, to the end that any who fall short in their duty to you may, when they learn
how gentle you are, only blame themselves for having wronged one of such a character as
yourself!</p>
<p>2. I should be very glad to know the object which your goodness has in view, in ordering
the servants to be conveyed to the spot where they were guilty of their disorderly conduct.
If you come yourself, and exact in person the punishment due for the offence, the slaves
shall be there. What other course is possible if you have made up your mind? Only that I
do not know what further favour I shall have received, if I shall have failed to get the boys
off their punishment. But if business detain you on the way, who is to receive the fellows
there? Who is to punish them in your stead? But if you have made up your mind to meet
them yourself, and this is quite determined on, tell them to halt at Sasima, and there show
the extent of your gentleness and magnanimity. After having your assailants in your own
power, and so showing them that your dignity is not to be lightly esteemed, let them go scot
free, as I urged you in my former letter. So you will confer a favour on me, and will receive
the requital of your good deed from God.</p>
<p>3. I speak in this way, not because the business ought so to be ended, but as a concession
to your agitated feelings, and in fear lest somewhat of your wrath may remain still raw.
When a man’s eyes are inflamed the softest application seems painful, and I am afraid lest
what I say may rather irritate than calm you. What would really be most becoming, bringing
great credit to you, and no little cause of honour to me with my friends and contemporaries,
would be for you to leave the punishment to me. And although you have sworn to deliver
them to execution as the law enjoins, my rebuke is still of no less value as a punishment,
nor is the divine law of less account than the laws current in the world. But it will be possible

for them, by being punished here by our laws, wherein too lies your own hope of salvation,
both to release you from your oath and to undergo a penalty commensurate with their faults.</p>
<p>But once more I am making my letter too long. In the very earnest desire to persuade
you I cannot bear to leave unsaid any of the pleas which occur to me, and I am much afraid
lest my entreaty should prove ineffectual from my failing to say all that may convey my
meaning. Now, true and honoured son of the Church, confirm the hopes which I have of
you; prove true all the testimony unanimously given to your placability and gentleness.
Give orders to the soldier to leave me without delay; he is now as tiresome and rude as he
can well be; he evidently prefers giving no cause of annoyance to you to making all of us
here his close friends.</p>

<head>To Martinianus.2261</head>
<p>1. How high do you suppose one to prize the pleasure of our meeting one another once
again? How delightful to spend longer time with you so as to enjoy all your good qualities!
If powerful proof is given of culture in seeing many men’s cities and knowing many men’s
ways,2262 such I am sure is quickly given in your society. For what is the difference between
seeing many men singly or one who has gained experience of all together? I should say that
there is an immense superiority in that which gives us the knowledge of good and beautiful
things without trouble, and puts within our reach instruction in virtue, pure from all admixture
of evil. Is there question of noble deed; of words worth handing down; of institutions
of men of superhuman excellence? All are treasured in the store house of your mind. Not
then, would I pray, that I might listen to you, like Alcinous to Ulysses, only for a year, but
throughout all my life; and to this end I would pray that my life might be long, even though
my state were no easy one. Why, then, am I now writing when I ought to be coming to see
you? Because my country in her troubles calls me irresistibly to her side. You know, my
friend, how she suffers. She is torn in pieces like Pentheus by veritable Mænads, dæmons.
They are dividing her, and dividing her again, like bad surgeons who, in their ignorance,
make wounds worse. Suffering as she is from this dissection, it remains for me to tend her
like a sick patient. So the Cæsareans have urgently appealed to me by letter, and I must go,
not as though I could be of any help, but to avoid any blame of neglect. You know how
ready men in difficulties are to hope; and ready too, I ween, to find fault, always charging
their troubles on what has been left undone.</p>
<p>2. Yet for this very reason I ought to have come to see you, and to have told you my
mind, or rather to implore you to bethink you of some strong measure worthy of your wisdom;
not to turn aside from my country falling on her knees, but to betake yourself to the
Court, and, with the boldness which is all your own, not to let them suppose that they own
two provinces instead of one. They have not imported the second from some other part of
the world, but have acted somewhat in the same way in which some owner of horse or ox
might act, who should cut it in two, and then think that he had two instead of one, instead

of failing to make two and destroying the one he had. Tell the Emperor and his ministers
that they are not after this fashion increasing the empire, for power lies not in number but
in condition. I am sure that now men are neglecting the course of events, some, possibly,
from ignorance of the truth, some from their being unwilling to say anything offensive,
some because it does not immediately concern them. The course likely to be most beneficial,
and worthy of your high principles, would be for you, if possible, to approach the Emperor
in person. If this is difficult both on account of the season of the year and of your age, of
which, as you say, inactivity is the foster brother, at all events you need have no difficulty
in writing. If you thus give our country the aid of a letter, you will first of all have the satisfaction
of knowing that you have left nothing undone that was in your power, and further,
by showing sympathy, if only in appearance, you will give the patient much comfort. Would
only that it were possible for you to come yourself among us and actually see our deplorable
condition! Thus, perhaps, stirred by the plain evidence before you, you might have spoken
in terms worthy alike of your own magnanimity and of the affliction of Cæsarea. But do
not withhold belief from what I am telling you. Verily we want some Simonides, or other
like poet, to lament our troubles from actual experience. But why name Simonides? I should
rather mention Æschylus, or any other who has set forth a great calamity in words like his,
and uttered lamentation with a mighty voice.</p>
<p>3. Now we have no more meetings, no more debates, no more gatherings of wise men
in the Forum, nothing more of all that made our city famous. In our Forum nowadays it
would be stranger for a learned or eloquent man to put in an appearance, than it would for
men, shewing a brand of iniquity or unclean hands, to have presented themselves in Athens
of old. Instead of them we have the imported boorishness of Massagetæ and Scythians.
And only one noise is heard of drivers of bargains, and losers of bargains, and of fellows
under the lash. On either hand the porticoes resound with doleful echoes, as though they
were uttering a natural and proper sound in groaning at what is going on. Our distress
prevents our paying any attention to locked gymnasia and nights when no torch is lighted.
There is no small danger lest, our magistrates being removed, everything crash down together
as with fallen props. What words can adequately describe our calamities? Some have fled
into exile, a considerable portion of our senate, and that not the least valuable, prefering
perpetual banishment to Podandus.2263 When I mention Podandus, suppose me to mean
the Spartan Ceadas2264 or any natural pit that you may have seen, spots breathing a noxious
vapour, to which some have involuntarily given the name Charonian. Picture to yourself

that the evils of Podandus are a match for such a place. So, of three parts, some have left
their homes and are in exile, wives and hearth and all; some are being led away like captives,
the majority of the best men in the city, a piteous spectacle to their friends, fulfilling their
enemies’ prayers; if, that is, any one has ever been found to call down so dire a curse upon
our heads. A third division yet remains: these, unable to endure abandonment by their old
companions, and at the same time unable to provide for themselves, have to hate their very
lives.</p>
<p>This is what I implore you to make known everywhere with an eloquence all your own,
and that righteous boldness of speech which your manner of life gives you. One thing distinctly
state; that, unless the authorities soon change their counsels, they will find none left
on whom to exercise their clemency. You will either prove some help to the state, or at least
you will have done as Solon did, who, when he was unable to defend his abandoned fellow
citizens on the capture of the Acropolis, put on his armour, and sat down before the gates,
thus making it plain by this guise that he was no party to what was going on.2265 Of one
thing I am assured, even though at the present moment there may be some who do not approve
of your advice, the day is not far distant when they will give you the greatest credit

Our institutions are a thing of the past; and all our men of high civil rank, in despair at what
has happened to our magistrates, have left their homes in the city and are wandering about
the country. There is a break therefore in the necessary conduct of affairs, and the city,
which ere now gloried both in men of learning and in others who abound in opulent towns,

your letter from the reverend Eleusinius, and saw him actually before my face, I
praised God for bestowing on me such a champion and comrade, in my struggles on behalf
of true religion by the aid of the Spirit. Be it known to your exalted reverence that I have
hitherto sustained some attacks from high magistrates, and these no light ones; while both
the prefect and the high chamberlain pleaded with sympathy for my opponents. But, so
far, I have sustained every assault unmoved, by that mercy of God which supplies to me the
aid of the Spirit, and strengthens my weakness through Him.</p>

<p>The worse the diseases of the Churches grow, the more do we all turn to your excellency,
in the belief that your championship is the one consolation left to us in our troubles. By
the power of your prayers, and your knowledge of what is the best course to suggest in the
emergency, you are believed to be able to save us from this terrible tempest by all alike who
know your excellency even to a small extent, whether by hearsay or by personal experience.
Wherefore, cease not, I implore, to pray for our souls and to rouse us by your letters. Did
you but know of what service these are to us you would never have lost a single opportunity
of writing. Could I only, by the aid of your prayers, be deemed worthy of seeing you, and
of enjoying your good qualities, and of adding to the story of my life a meeting with your
truly great and apostolical soul, then I should indeed believe that I had received from God’s

<p>I was delighted to receive the letter your affection sent me; but I am equally grieved at
your having laid on me the load of a responsibility which is more than I can carry. How
can I, so far removed as I am, undertake so great a charge? As long as the Church possesses
you, it rests as it were on its proper buttress. Should the Lord be pleased to make some
dispensation in the matter of your life, whom, from among us here can I send to take the
charge of the brethren, who will be in like esteem with yourself? That is a very wise and
proper wish which you express in your letter, that while you are yet alive you may see the
successor destined after you to guide the chosen flock of the Lord (like the blessed Moses,
who both wished and saw). As the place is great and famous, and your work has great and
wide renown, and the times are difficult, needing no insignificant guide on account of the
continuous storms and tempests which are attacking the Church, I have not thought it safe
for my own soul to treat the matter perfunctorily, specially when I bear in mind the terms
in which you write. For you say that, accusing me of disregard of the Churches, you mean
to withstand me before the Lord. Not then to be at issue with you, but rather to have you
on my side in my defence which I make in the presence of Christ I have, after looking round
in the assembly of the presbyters of the city, chosen the very honourable vessel, the offspring2279
of the blessed Hermogenes, who wrote the great and invincible creed in the great
Synod.2280 He is a presbyter of the Church, of many years standing, of steadfast character,
skilled in canons, accurate in the faith, who has lived up to this time in continence and ascetic
discipline, although the severity of his austere life has now subdued the flesh; a man
of poverty, with no resources in this world, so that he is not even provided with bare bread,
but by the labour of his hands gets a living with the brethren who dwell with him. It is my
intention to send him. If, then, this is the kind of man you want, and not some younger
man fit only to be sent and to discharge the common duties of this world, be so good as to
write to me at the first opportunity, that I may send you this man, who is elect of God, adapted
for the present work, respected by all who meet him, and who instructs with meekness

<p>When I turn my gaze upon the world, and perceive the difficulties by which every effort
after good is obstructed, like those of a man walking in fetters, I am brought to despair of
myself. But then I direct my gaze in the direction of your reverence; I remember that our
Lord has appointed you to be physician of the diseases in the Churches; and I recover my
spirits, and rise from the depression of despair to the hope of better things. As your wisdom
well knows, the whole Church is undone. And you see everything in all directions in your
mind’s eye like a man looking from some tall watch tower,2282 as when at sea many ships
sailing together are all dashed one against the other by the violence of the waves, and shipwreck
arises in some cases from the sea being furiously agitated from without, in others
from the disorder of the sailors hindering and crowding one another. It is enough to present
this picture, and to say no more.2283 Your wisdom requires nothing farther, and the present
state of affairs does not allow me freedom of speech. What capable pilot can be found in
such a storm? Who is worthy to rouse the Lord to rebuke the wind and the sea? Who but
he who from his boyhood2284 fought a good fight on behalf of true religion? Since now
truly all that is sound among us is moving in the direction of fellowship and unity with those
who are of the same opinion, we have come confidently to implore you to send us a single
letter, advising us what is to be done. In this way they wish that they may have a beginning
of communication which may promote unity. They may, peradventure, be suspected by
you, when you remember the past, and therefore, most God-beloved Father, do as follows;
send me the letters to the bishops, either by the hand of some one in whom you place trust
in Alexandria, or by the hand of our brother Dorotheus the deacon: when I have received
these letters I will not deliver them till I have got the bishops’ answers; if not, let me “bear
the blame for ever.”2285 Truly this ought not to have struck more awe into him who first

<p>I have had only a short acquaintance and intercourse with your lordship, but I have no
small or contemptible knowledge of you from the reports through which I am brought into
communication with many men of position and importance. You yourself are better able
to say whether I, by report, am of any account with you. At all events your reputation with

to remind your excellency that in the hope of the requital God will give, you should show
yourself of such a character as to win a memory that cannot die, and be made an inheritor
of everlasting rest, in consequence of your making the afflictions of the distressed hard to
bear. I have a property at Chamanene, and I beg you to look after its interests as though
they were your own. And pray do not be surprised at my calling my friend’s property my
own, for among other virtues I have been taught that of friendship, and I remember the
author of the wise saying a friend is another self.2288 I therefore commend to your excellency
this property belonging to my friend, as though it were my own. I beg you to consider the
misfortunes of the house, and both to grant them consolation for the past, and for the future

<head>Letter LXXXIV.2289</head>
<head>To the President.2290</head>
<p>1. You will hardly believe what I am about to write, but it must be written for truth’s
sake. I have been very anxious to communicate as often as possible with your excellency,
but when I got this opportunity of writing a letter I did not at once seize the lucky chance.
I hesitated and hung back. What is astonishing is, that when I got what I had been praying
for, I did not take it. The reason of this is that I am really ashamed to write to you every
time, not out of pure friendship, but with the object of getting something. But then I bethought
me (and when you consider it, I do hope you will not think that I communicate
with you more for the sake of a bargain than of friendship) that there must be a difference
between the way in which one approaches a magistrate and a private man. We do not accost
a physician as we do any mere nobody; nor a magistrate as we do a private individual. We
try to get some advantage from the skill of the one and the position of the other. Walk in
the sun, and your shadow will follow you, whether you will or not. Just so intercourse with
the great is followed by an inevitable gain, the succour of the distressed. The first object of
my letter is fulfilled in my being able to greet your excellency. Really, if I had no other cause
for writing at all, this must be regarded as an excellent topic. Be greeted then, my dear Sir;
may you be preserved by all the world while you fill office after office, and succour now
some now others by your authority. Such greeting I am wont to make; such greeting is only
due to you from all who have had the least experience of your goodness in your administration.</p>
<p>2. Now, after this prayer, hear my supplication on behalf of the poor old man whom
the imperial order had exempted from serving in any public capacity; though really I might
say that old age anticipated the Emperor in giving him his discharge. You have yourself
satisfied the boon conferred on him by the higher authority, at once from respect to natural
infirmity, and, I think, from regard to the public interest, lest any harm should come to the
state from a man growing imbecile through age. But how, my dear Sir, have you unwittingly
dragged him into public life, by ordering his grandson, a child not yet four years old, to be
on the roll of the senate? You have done the very same thing as to drag the old man, through
his descendant, again into public business. But now, I do implore you, have mercy on both
ages, and free both on the ground of what in each case is pitiable. The one never saw father
or mother, never knew them, but from his very cradle was deprived of both, and has entered
into life by the help of strangers: the other has been preserved so long as to have suffered

every kind of calamity. He saw a son’s untimely death; he saw a house without successors;
now, unless you devise some remedy commensurate with your kindness, he will see the very
consolation of his bereavement made an occasion of innumerable troubles, for, I suppose,
the little lad will never act as senator, collect tribute, or pay troops; but once again the old
man’s white hairs must be shamed. Concede a favour in accordance with the law and
agreeable to nature; order the boy to be allowed to wait till he come to man’s estate, and the
old man to await death quietly on his bed. Let others, if they will, urge the pretext of press
of business and inevitable necessity. But, even if you are under a press of business, it would
not be like you to despise the distressed, to slight the law, or to refuse to yield to the prayers
of your friends.</p>

<head>Letter LXXXV.2291</head>
<head>That the oath ought not to be taken.2292</head>
<p>It is my invariable custom to protest at every synod and to urge privately in conversation,
that oaths about the taxes ought not to be imposed on husbandmen by the collectors. It
remains for me to bear witness, on the same matters, in writing, before God and men, that
it behoves you to cease from inflicting death upon men’s souls, and to devise some other
means of exaction, while you let men keep their souls unwounded. I write thus to you, not
as though you needed any spoken exhortation (for you have your own immediate inducements
to fear the Lord), but that all your dependents may learn from you not to provoke
the Holy One, nor let a forbidden sin become a matter of indifference, through faulty familiarity.
No possible good can be done them by oaths, with a view to their paying what is exacted
from them, and they suffer an undeniable wrong to the soul. For when men become
practised in perjury, they no longer put any pressure on themselves to pay, but they think
that they have discovered in the oath a means of trickery and an opportunity for delay. If,
then, the Lord brings a sharp retribution on the perjured, when the debtors are destroyed
by punishment there will be none to answer when summoned. If on the other hand the
Lord endures with long suffering, then, as I said before, those who have tried the patience
of the Lord despise His goodness. Let them not break the law in vain; let them not whet the
wrath of God against them. I have said what I ought. The disobedient will see.</p>

The cause is right for which we are pleading; it is dear to me who am numbered among your

The corn, which was all my very, dear brother Dorotheus had for the necessaries of life, has
been carried off by some of the authorities at Berisi, entrusted with the management of affairs,
driven to this violence of their own accord or by others’ instigation. Either way it is an indictable
offence. For how does the man whose wickedness is his own do less wrong than
he who is the mere minister of other men’s wickedness? To the sufferers the loss is the
same. I implore you, therefore, that Dorotheus may have his corn returned by the men by
whom he has been robbed, and that they may not be allowed to lay the guilt of their outrage
on other men’s shoulders. If you grant me my request I shall reckon the value of the boon

gives me of saluting your reverence. He Himself is witness of the earnest desire which I
have to see your face, and to enjoy your good and soul-refreshing instruction. Now by my
reverend and excellent brother Dorotheus, the deacon, who is setting out, first of all I beg
you to pray for me that I be no stumbling block to the people, nor hindrance to your petitions
to propitiate the Lord. In the second place I would suggest that you would be so good as to
make all arrangements through the aforementioned brother; and, if it seems well that a letter
should be sent to the Westerns, because it is only right that communication should be made
in writing even through our own messenger, that you will dictate the letter. I have met
Sabinus the deacon, sent by them, and have written to the bishops in Illyria, Italy, and Gaul,
and to some of those who have written privately to myself. For it is right that some one
should be sent in the common interests of the Synod, conveying a second letter which I beg
you to have written.</p>

aware of what I will mention, that it is impossible for anything to be advanced by my letters,
or for any desirable objects to be carried out, unless by some means or other he receives
communion from you, who at that time postponed it. He is described as being very anxious
to unite with me, and to be willing to contribute all he can, but to be sorry that he was sent
away without communion, and that the promise still remains unfulfilled.2301</p>
<p>What is going on in the East cannot have failed to reach your reverence’s ears, but the
aforementioned brother will give you more accurate information by word of mouth. Be so
good as to dispatch him directly after Easter, because of his waiting for the answer from
Samosata. Look kindly on his zeal strengthen him by your prayers and so dispatch him on

Maran, however, points out (Vit. Bas. xxii.) not only how the circumstances fit in, but how the statement that
communion was refused by Meletius is borne out by Letter cclviii. § 3, q.v. Athanasius was in fact so far committed
to the other side in the unhappy Antiochene dispute that it was impossible for him to recognise Meletius.

<p>1. The good God Who ever mixes consolation with affliction has, even now in the midst
of my pangs, granted me a certain amount of comfort in the letters which our right honourable
father bishop Athanasius has received from you and sent on to me. For they contain
evidence of sound faith and proof of your inviolable agreement and concord, showing thus
that the shepherds are following in the footsteps of the Fathers and feeding the people of
the Lord with knowledge. All this has so much gladdened my heart as to dispel my despondency
and to create something like a smile in my soul in the midst of the distressing state of
affairs in which we are now placed. The Lord has also extended His consolation to me by
means of the reverend deacon Sabinus, my son, who has cheered my soul by giving me an
exact narrative of your condition; and from personal experience of his own, will give you
clear tidings of ours, that you may, in the first place, aid me in my trouble by earnest and
constant prayer to God; and next that you may consent to give such consolation as lies in
your power to our afflicted Churches. For here, very honourable brethren, all is in a weak
state; the Church has given way before the continuous attacks of her foes, like some bark in
mid-ocean buffeted by successive blows of the waves; unless haply there be some quick visitation
of the divine mercy. As then we reckon your mutual sympathy and unity an important
blessing to ourselves, so do we implore you to pity our dissensions; and not, because we are
separated by a great extent of country, to part us from you, but to admit us to the concord
of one body, because we are united in the fellowship of the Spirit.</p>
<p>2. Our distresses are notorious, even though we leave them untold, for now their sound
has gone out into all the world. The doctrines of the Fathers are despised; apostolic traditions
are set at nought; the devices of innovators are in vogue in the Churches; now men are rather
contrivers of cunning systems than theologians; the wisdom of this world wins the highest
prizes and has rejected the glory of the cross. Shepherds are banished, and in their places
are introduced grievous wolves hurrying the flock of Christ. Houses of prayer have none
to assemble in them; desert places are full of lamenting crowds. The elders lament when
they compare the present with the past. The younger are yet more to be compassionated,
for they do not know of what they have been deprived. All this is enough to stir the pity of
men who have learnt the love of Christ; but, compared with the actual state of things, words
fall very far short. If then there be any consolation of love, any fellowship of the Spirit, any

The cause is not far to seek, for iniquity is multiplied and the love of many has grown
cold.2308 For this reason your letter is precious to me, and I am replying by our reverend
brother Sabinus. By him I make myself known to you, and beseech you to be watchful in
prayers on our behalf, that God may one day grant calm and quiet to the Church here, and
rebuke this wind and sea, that so we may be freed from the storm and agitation in which
we are now every moment expecting to be submerged. But in these our troubles one great
boon has God given us in hearing that you are in exact agreement and unity with one another,
and that the doctrines of true religion are preached among you without let or hindrance.
For at some time or other, unless the period of this world is not already concluded, and if
there yet remain days of human life, it must needs be that by your means the faith must be
renewed in the East and that in due season you recompense her for the blessings which she
has given you. The sound part among us here, which preserves the true religion of the
Fathers, is sore stricken, and the devil in his wiliness has shattered it by many and various
subtle assaults. But, by the help of the prayers of you who love the Lord, may the wicked
and deceitful heresy of the Arian error be quenched; may the good teaching of the Fathers,
who met at Nicæa, shine forth; so that the ascription of glory may be rendered to the blessed
Trinity in the terms of the baptism of salvation.</p>

bour is the fulfilling of the law.2326 But, as we have said, the just judgment of God, which
has ordained that the affliction due to our sins must be fulfilled, has held you back. But
when you have learnt all, specially what has not hitherto reached your ears, from our reverend
brother the deacon Sabinus, who will be able to narrate in person what is omitted in our
letter, we do beseech you to be roused both to zeal for the truth and sympathy for us. We
implore you to put on bowels of mercy, to lay aside all hesitation, and to undertake the labour
of love, without counting length of way, your own occupations, or any other human interests.</p>
<p>2. It is not only one Church which is in peril, nor yet two or three which have fallen
under this terrible storm. The mischief of this heresy spreads almost from the borders of
Illyricum to the Thebaid. Its bad seeds were first sown by the infamous Arius; they then
took deep root through the labours of many who vigorously cultivated the impiety between
his time and ours. Now they have produced their deadly fruit. The doctrines of true religion
are overthrown. The laws of the Church are in confusion. The ambition of men, who have
no fear of God, rushes into high posts, and exalted office is now publicly known as the prize
of impiety. The result is, that the worse a man blasphemes, the fitter the people think him
to be a bishop. Clerical dignity is a thing of the past. There is a complete lack of men
shepherding the Lord’s flock with knowledge. Ambitious men are constantly throwing away
the provision for the poor on their own enjoyment and the distribution of gifts. There is
no precise knowledge of canons. There is complete immunity in sinning; for when men
have been placed in office by the favour of men, they are obliged to return the favour by
continually showing indulgence to offenders. Just judgment is a thing of the past; and
everyone walks according to his heart’s desire. Vice knows no bounds; the people know no
restraint. Men in authority are afraid to speak, for those who have reached power by human
interest are the slaves of those to whom they owe their advancement. And now the very
vindication of orthodoxy is looked upon in some quarters as an opportunity for mutual attack;
and men conceal their private ill-will and pretend that their hostility is all for the sake
of the truth. Others, afraid of being convicted of disgraceful crimes, madden the people
into fratricidal quarrels, that their own doings may be unnoticed in the general distress.
Hence the war admits of no truce, for the doers of ill deeds are afraid of a peace, as being
likely to lift the veil from their secret infamy. All the while unbelievers laugh; men of weak
faith are shaken; faith is uncertain; souls are drenched in ignorance, because adulterators
of the word imitate the truth. The mouths of true believers are dumb, while every blasphemous
tongue wags free; holy things are trodden under foot; the better laity shun the churches
as schools of impiety; and lift their hands in the deserts with sighs and tears to their Lord
in heaven. Even you must have heard what is going on in most of our cities, how our people
with wives and children and even our old men stream out before the walls, and offer their
<note type="footnote">2326 cf. Rom. xiii. 10.</note>

<pb n="525"/>
prayers in the open air, putting up with all the inconvenience of the weather with great patience,
and waiting for help from the Lord.</p>
<p>3. What lamentation can match these woes? What springs of tears are sufficient for
them? While, then, some men do seem to stand, while yet a trace of the old state of things
is left, before utter shipwreck comes upon the Churches, hasten to us, hasten to us now,
true brothers, we implore you; on our knees we implore you, hold out a helping hand. May
your brotherly bowels be moved toward us; may tears of sympathy flow; do not see, unmoved,
half the empire swallowed up by error; do not let the light of the faith be put out in the place
where it shone first.</p>
<p>By what action you can then help matters, and how you are to show sympathy for the
afflicted, you do not want to be told by us; the Holy Ghost will suggest to you. But unquestionably,
if the survivors are to be saved, there is need of prompt action, and of the arrival
of a considerable number of brethren, that those who visit us may complete the number of
the synod, in order that they may have weight in effecting a reform, not merely from the
dignity of those whose emissaries they are, but also from their own number: thus they will
restore the creed drawn up by our fathers at Nicæa, proscribe the heresy, and, by bringing
into agreement all who are of one mind, speak peace to the Churches. For the saddest thing
about it all is that the sound part is divided against itself, and the troubles we are suffering
are like those which once befel Jerusalem when Vespasian was besieging it. The Jews of that
time were at once beset by foes without and consumed by the internal sedition of their own
people. In our case, too, in addition to the open attack of the heretics, the Churches are reduced
to utter helplessness by the war raging among those who are supposed to be orthodox.
For all these reasons we do indeed desire your help, that, for the future all who confess the
apostolic faith may put an end to the schisms which they have unhappily devised, and be
reduced for the future to the authority of the Church; that so, once more, the body of Christ
may be complete, restored to integrity with all its members. Thus we shall not only praise
the blessings of others, which is all we can do now, but see our own Churches once more
restored to their pristine boast of orthodoxy. For, truly, the boon given you by the Lord is
fit subject for the highest congratulation, your power of discernment between the spurious
and the genuine and pure, and your preaching the faith of the Fathers without any dissimulation.
That faith we have received; that faith we know is stamped with the marks of the
Apostles; to that faith we assent, as well as to all that was canonically and lawfully promulgated
in the Synodical Letter.2327</p>
<note type="footnote">2327 After noting that the Synodical Letter is to be found in Theodoret and in Sozomen (i.e. is in Theodoret

<head>To the Patrician Cæsaria,2329 concerning Communion.</head>
<p>It is good and beneficial to communicate every day, and to partake of the holy body and
blood of Christ. For He distinctly says, “He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood
hath eternal life.”2330 And who doubts that to share frequently in life, is the same thing as
to have manifold life. I, indeed, communicate four times a week, on the Lord’s day, on
Wednesday, on Friday, and on the Sabbath, and on the other days if there is a commemoration
of any Saint.2331 It is needless to point out that for anyone in times of persecution to
be compelled to take the communion in his own hand without the presence of a priest or
minister is not a serious offence, as long custom sanctions this practice from the facts
themselves. All the solitaries in the desert, where there is no priest, take the communion
themselves, keeping communion at home. And at Alexandria and in Egypt, each one of the
laity, for the most part, keeps the communion, at his own house, and participates in it when
he likes. For when once the priest has completed the offering, and given it, the recipient,
participating in it each time as entire, is bound to believe that he properly takes and receives
it from the giver. And even in the church, when the priest gives the portion, the recipient
takes it with complete power over it, and so lifts it to his lips with his own hand. It has the
same validity whether one portion or several portions are received from the priest at the
same time.2332</p>

and ccxxxvi. and the De Sp. Sancto. § 7. On the difficulty of expressing the terms in Latin, cf. Letter ccxiv. As
ὑπόστασις was in 325 understood to be equivalent to οὐσία, and in 370 had acquired a different connotation, it
would be no more difficult for Basil than for the Church now, to assent to what is called the Nicene position,
while confessing three hypostases. In Letter cxxv. Basil does indeed try to shew, but apparently without success,
that to condemn the statement that He is of a different hypostasis is not equivalent to asserting Him to be of the
same hypostasis.</note>

<head>To Elias, Governor of the Province.</head>
<p>I too have been very anxious to meet your excellency, lest by my failure to do so I might
come off worse than my accusers; but bodily sickness has prevented me, attacking me even
more seriously than usual, and so I am perforce reduced to address you by letter. When,
not long ago, most excellent sir, I had the pleasure of meeting your excellency, I was anxious
to communicate with your wisdom about all my affairs; and I was also anxious to address
you on behalf of the Churches, that no ground might be left for future calumnies. But I restrained
myself, thinking it altogether superfluous and importunate to add troubles outside
his own necessary business to a man charged with so many responsibilities. At the same
time (for the truth shall be told) I did shrink from being driven to wound your soul by our
mutual recriminations, when it ought in pure devotion to God to reap the perfect reward
of piety. For really, if I attract your attention to me, I shall leave you but scant leisure for
your public duties; shall act something like a man overloading with additional luggage some
boatmen managing a new boat in very rough water, when all the while he ought to lessen
the cargo and do his best to lighten the craft. For this very reason, I think, our great Emperor,
after seeing how fully occupied I am, leaves me to manage the Churches by myself. Now I
should like those who are besieging your impartial ears to be asked what harm the government
suffers from me? What depreciation is suffered by any public interests, be they small
or great, by my administration of the Churches? Still, possibly, it might be urged that I have
done damage to the government by erecting a magnificently appointed church to God, and
round it a dwelling house, one liberally assigned to the bishop, and others underneath, allotted
to the officers of the Church in order, the use of both being open to you of the magistracy
and your escort. But to whom do we do any harm by building a place of entertainment for
strangers, both for those who are on a journey and for those who require medical treatment
on account of sickness, and so establishing a means of giving these men the comfort they
want, physicians, doctors, means of conveyance, and escort?2334 All these men must learn
<note type="footnote">reservation. On the doctrine of the English Church on this subject reference may be made to the Report of a
Committee of the Upper House of the Convocation of Canterbury in 1885. The Rubric of 1549 allowed reservation,
and it does not seem to have been prohibited until 1661. Bishop A. P. Forbes on Article xxviii. points out that
in the Article reservation is not forbidden, but declared not to be of Christ’s institution, and consequently not
binding on the Church. The distinction will not be forgotten between reservation and worship of the reserved
Sacrament.</note>

such occupations as are necessary to life and have been found essential to a respectable career;
they must also have buildings suitable for their employments, all of which are an honour
to the place, and, as their reputation is credited to our governor, confer glory on him. Not
indeed that for this reason you were unwillingly induced to accept the responsibility of ruling
us, for you alone are sufficient by your high qualities to restore our ruins, to people deserted
districts and turn wildernesses into towns. Would it be better to harrass and annoy, or to
honour and reverence an associate in the discharge of these duties? Do not think, most excellent
sir, that what I say is mere words. We have already, in the meanwhile, begun
providing material. So much for our defence, before our ruler. As to what is to be said in
answer to the charges of our accusers, to a Christian and to a friend who cares for my
opinion, I must now say no more; the subject is too long for a letter, and cannot, besides,
be safely committed to writing. But lest, before we have an opportunity of meeting, you are
driven by the inducement of some men’s calumnies to give up any of your good will towards
me, do as Alexander did. The story is, as you remember, that, when one of his friends was
being calumniated, he left one ear open to the slanderer, and carefully closed the other with
his hand, with the object of showing that he whose duty is to judge ought not to be easily
and wholly given over to the first occupants of his attention, but should keep half his hearing
open for the defence of the absent.2335</p>

<head>To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.</head>
<p>I had written some while since to your reverence about our meeting one another and
other subjects, but I was disappointed at my letter not reaching your excellency, for after
the blessed deacon Theophrastus had taken charge of the letter, on my setting out on an
unavoidable journey, he did not convey it to your reverence, because he was seized by the
sickness of which he died. Hence it happened that I was so late in writing, that, the time
being now so exceedingly short, I did not look for there being much use in this letter. The
godly bishop Meletius and Theodotus had strongly urged me to visit them, representing
that a meeting would be a proof of affection, and being wishful of remedying the troubles
which are at present a cause of anxiety.2337 They had appointed, as a time for our meeting,
the middle of the approaching month of June, and for the place, Phargamus, a spot famous
for martyr’s glory and for the large number of people attending the synod there every year.
Directly I returned and heard of the death of the blessed deacon, and that my letter was lying
useless at home, I felt that I must not be idle, because thirty-three days were still remaining
up to the appointed time, and so I hurriedly sent the letter to the very reverend Eustathius,
my fellow minister, with the object of its being sent on by him to your reverence and of
getting an answer without delay. If, then, it is possible and agreeable to you to come, I will
come too. If not, I, God willing, will pay the debt of meeting due from last year: unless
haply some hindrance for my sins comes in the way again, in which case I must put off my
meeting with the bishops to another time.</p>

<p>Who ever loved his city, honouring with filial love the place which gave him birth and
nurture, as you do; praying for the whole city together, and for every one in it individually,
and not merely praying but confirming your prayers by your own means? For this you are
able to effect by God’s help, and long, good man that you are, may you be able so to do.
Nevertheless in your time our city has enjoyed but a brief dream of prosperity, in being
committed to the charge of one the like of whom, according to the students of our oldest
annals, never sat in the præfectorial chair. But now the city has suddenly lost his services,
through the wickedness of men who have found a ground of attack in his very liberality and
impartiality, and, without the knowledge of your excellency, have made up calumnies against
him. There is therefore universal depression among us at the loss of a governor with unique
capacity for raising our dejected community, a true guardian of justice, accessible to the
wronged, a terror to law breakers, of like behaviour to rich and poor, and, what is most
important, one who has restored the interests of Christians to their old place of honour.
That he was, of all men that I know, the most incapable of being bribed, and never did any
one an unfair favour, I have passed by as a small point in comparison with his other virtues.
I am indeed testifying to all this too late, like men who sing dirges to console themselves
when they can get no practical relief. Yet, it is not useless that his memory should remain
in your generous heart, and that you should be grateful to him as a benefactor of your native
place. Should any of those who feel a grudge against him, for not sacrificing justice to their
interests, attack him, it will be well for you to defend and protect him. Thus you will make
it clear to all that you count his interests yours, and think it quite a sufficient reason for this
your close association with him that his record should be so unimpeachable, and his administration
so remarkable in view of the time. For what any other man would not be able to
affect in many years has been quickly accomplished by him. It will be a great favour to me,
and a comfort under the circumstances, if you will recommend him to the Emperor, and
dispel the calumnious charges brought against him. Believe me that I am speaking here not
for myself alone, but for the whole community, and that it is our unanimous prayer that he
may reap some benefit from your excellency’s aid.</p>

<head>Letter XCVII.2340</head>
<head>To the Senate of Tyana.2341</head>
<p>The Lord, Who reveals hidden things, and makes manifest the counsels of men’s hearts,
has given even to the lowly knowledge of devices apparently hard to be understood. Nothing
has escaped my notice, nor has any single action been unknown. Nevertheless I neither see
nor hear anything but the peace of God and all that pertains to it. Others may be great and
powerful and self-confident, but I am nothing and worth nothing, and so I could never take
upon myself so much as to think myself able to manage matters without support. I know
perfectly well that I stand more in need of the succour of each of the brethren than one hand
does of the other. Truly, from our own bodily constitution, the Lord has taught us the necessity
of fellowship. When I look to these my limbs and see that no out of them is selfsufficient,
how can I reckon myself competent to discharge the duties of life? One foot could
not walk securely without the support of the other; one eye could not see well, were it not
for the alliance of the other and for its being able to look at objects in conjunction with it.
Hearing is more exact when sound is received through both channels, and the grasp is made
firmer by the fellowship of the fingers. In a word, of all that is done by nature and by the
will, I see nothing done without the concord of fellow forces. Even prayer, when it is not
united prayer, loses its natural strength and the Lord has told us that He will be in the midst
where two or three call on Him in concord. The Lord Himself undertook the economy,2342
that by the blood of His cross He might make peace between things in earth and things in
heaven. For all these reasons then, I pray that I may for my remaining days remain in peace;
in peace I ask that it may be my lot to fall asleep. For peace’s sake there is no trouble that I
will not undertake, no act, no word of humility, that I will shrink from; I will reckon no
length of journey, I will undergo any inconvenience, if only I may be rewarded by being
able to make peace. If I am followed by any one in this direction, it is well, and my prayers
are answered; but if the result is different I shall not recede from my determination. Every
one will receive the fruit of his own works in the day of retribution.</p>

<head>Letter XCVIII.2343</head>
<head>To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.2344</head>
<p>1. After receiving the letter of your holiness, in which you said you would not come, I
was most anxious to set out for Nicopolis, but I have grown weaker in my wish and have
remembered all my infirmity. I bethought me, too, of the lack of seriousness in the conduct
of those who invited me. They gave me a casual invitation by the hands of our reverend
brother Hellenius, the surveyor of customs at Nazianzus, but they never took the trouble to
send a messenger to remind me, or any one to escort me. As, for my sins, I was an object
of suspicion to them, I shrank from sullying the brightness of their meeting by my presence.
In company with your excellency I do not shrink from stripping for even serious trials of
strength; but apart from you I feel myself hardly equal even to looking at every day troubles.
Since, then, my meeting with them was intended to be about Church affairs, I let the time
of the festival go by, and put off the meeting to a period of rest and freedom from distraction,
and have decided to go to Nicopolis to discuss the needs of the Churches with the godly
bishop Meletius, in case he should decline to go to Samosata. If he agrees, I shall hasten to
meet him, provided this is made clear to me by both of you, by him in reply to me (for I
have written), and by your reverence.</p>
<p>2. We were to have met the bishops of Cappadocia Secunda, who, directly they were
ranked under another prefecture, suddenly got the idea that they were made foreigners and
strangers to me. They ignored me, as though they had never been under my jurisdiction,
and had nothing to do with me. I was expecting too a second meeting with the reverend
bishop Eustathius, which actually took place. For on account of the cry raised by many
against him that he was injuring the faith, I met him, and found, by God’s grace, that he
was heartily following all orthodoxy. By the fault of the very men who ought to have conveyed

<head>Letter XCIX.2347</head>
<head>To Count Terentius.2348</head>
<p>I have had every desire and have really done my best to obey, if only in part, the imperial
order and the friendly letter of your excellency. I am sure that your every word and every
thought are full of good intentions and right sentiments. But I have not been permitted to
show my ready concurrence by practical action. The truest cause is my sins, which always
rise before me and always hamper my steps. Then, again, there is the alienation of the
bishop who had been appointed to cooperate with me, why, I know not; but my right reverend
brother Theodotus, who promised from the beginning to act with me, had cordially invited2349
me from Getasa to Nicopolis.2350 When however he saw me in the town, he was
so shocked at me, and so afraid of my sins, that he could not bear to take me either to
morning or evening prayer. In this he acted quite justly so far as my deserts go, and quite
as befits my course of life, but not in a manner likely to promote the interests of the
Churches. His alleged reason was that I had admitted the very reverend brother Eustathius
to communion. What I have done is as follows. When invited to a meeting held by our
brother Theodotus, and wishful, for love’s sake, to obey the summons, that I might not make
the gathering fruitless and vain, I was anxious to hold communication with the aforementioned
brother Eustathius. I put before him the accusations concerning the faith, advanced
against him by our brother Theodotus, and I asked him, if he followed the right faith, to
make it plain to me, that I might communicate with him; if he were of another mind he
must know plainly that I should be separated from him. We had much conversation on the
subject, and all that day was spent in its examination; when evening came on we separated
without arriving at any definite conclusion. On the morrow, we had another sitting in the
morning and discussed the same points, with the addition of our brother Poemenius, the
presbyter of Sebasteia, who vehemently pressed the argument against me. Point by point I
cleared up the questions on which he seemed to be accusing me, and brought them to agree
to my propositions. The result was, that, by the grace of the Lord, we were found to be in
mutual agreement, even on the most minute particulars. So about the ninth hour, after

<note type="footnote">2350 i.e. The Armenian Nicopolis.</note>

<pb n="535"/>
thanking God for granting us to think and say the same thing, we rose up to go to prayer.
In addition to this I ought to have got some written statement from him, so that his assent
might be made known to his opponents and the proof of his opinion might be sufficient for
the rest. But I was myself anxious, with the desire for great exactitude, to meet my brother
Theodotus, to get a written statement of the faith from him, and to propose it to Eustathius;
that so both objects might be obtained at once, the confession of the right faith by Eustathius
and the complete satisfaction of Theodotus and his friends, and they would have no
ground for objection after the acceptance of their own propositions. But Theodotus, before
learning why we were met and what had been the result of our intercourse, decided not to
allow us to take part in the meeting. So midway on our journey we set out back again, disappointed
that our efforts for the peace of the Churches had been counteracted.</p>
<p>3. After this, when I was compelled to undertake a journey into Armenia, knowing the
man’s character, and with the view both of making my own defence before a competent
witness, for what had taken place and of satisfying him, I travelled to Getasa, into the territory
of the very godly bishop Meletius, the aforementioned Theodotus being with me; and while
there, on being accused by him of my communication with Eustathius, I told him that the
result of our intercourse was my finding Eustathius to be in all things in agreement with
myself. Then he persisted that Eustathius, after leaving me, had denied this and asseverated
to his own disciples that he had never come to any agreement with me about the faith. I,
therefore, combated this statement; and see, O most excellent man, if the answer I made
was not most fair and most complete. I am convinced, I said, judging from the character
of Eustathius, that he cannot thus lightly be turning from one direction to another, now
confessing now denying what he said; that a man, shunning a lie, even in any little matter,
as an awful sin, is not likely to choose to run counter to the truth in matters of such vast
importance and so generally notorious: but if what is reported among you turns out to be
true, he must be confronted with a written statement containing the complete exposition
of the right faith; then, if I find him ready to agree in writing, I shall continue in communion
with him; but, if I find that he shrinks from the test, I shall renounce all intercourse with
him. The bishop Meletius agreed to these arguments, and the brother Diodorus the presbyter,
who was present, and then the right reverend brother Theodotus, assented, and invited me
to go to Nicopolis, both to visit the Church there, and to keep him company as far as Satala.
But he left me at Getasa, and, when I reached Nicopolis, forgetting all that he heard from
me, and the agreement he had made with me, dismissed me, disgraced by the insults and
dishonours which I have mentioned.</p>
<p>4. How, then, right honourable sir, was it possible for me to perform any of the in
junctions laid on me, and to provide bishops for Armenia? How could I act, when the sharer
of my responsibilities was thus disposed towards me,—the very man by whose aid I was
expecting to be able to find suitable persons, because of his having in his district reverend

<pb n="536"/>
and learned men, skilled in speech, and acquainted with the other peculiarities of the nation?
I know their names, but I shall refrain from mentioning them, lest there arise any hindrance
to the interests of Armenia being served at some future time.</p>
<p>Now, after getting as far as Satala in such a state of health, I seemed to settle the rest by
the grace of God. I made peace between the Armenian bishops, and made them a suitable
address, urging them to put away their customary indifference, and resume their ancient
zeal in the Lord’s cause. Moreover, I delivered them rules as to how it behoved them to give
heed to iniquities generally practised in Armenia. I further accepted a decision of the Church
of Satala, asking that a bishop might be given them through me. I was also careful to inquire
into the calumnies promulgated against our brother Cyril, the Armenian bishop, and by
God’s grace I have found them to be started by the lying slanders of his enemies. This they
confessed to me. And I seemed to some extent to reconcile the people to him, so that they
avoid communion with him no more. Small achievements these, maybe, and not worth
much, but in consequence of the mutual discord caused by the wiles of the devil, it was impossible
for me to effect more. Even this much I ought not to have said, so as not to seem
to be publishing my own disgrace. But as I could not plead my cause before your excellency
in any other way, I was under the necessity of telling you the entire truth.</p>

<head>To Eusebius, Bishop of Samosata.</head>
<p>When I saw your affectionate letter, in the country bordering on Armenia, it was like
a lighted torch held up at a distance to mariners at sea, especially if the sea happen to be
agitated by the wind. Your reverence’s letter was of itself a pleasant one, and full of comfort;
but its natural charm was very much enhanced by the time of its arrival, a time so painful
to me, that I hardly know how to describe it, after once making up my mind to forget its
troubles. However, my deacon will give you a full account. My bodily strength completely
failed me, so that I was not even able to bear the slightest movement without pain. Nevertheless
I do pray that, by the aid of your prayers, my own longing may be fulfilled; although
my journey has caused me great difficulties, in consequence of the affairs of my own Church
having been neglected through its occupying such a long time. But if, while I yet live, God
grants me to see your reverence in my Church, then truly I shall have good hope, even for
the future, that I am not wholly excluded from the gifts of God. If it be possible, I beg that
this meeting between us may take place at the Synod which we hold every year, in memory
of the blessed martyr Eupsychius,2352 now about to be held on the 7th of September. I am
compassed with anxieties which demand your help and sympathy, both in the matter of the
appointment of bishops and in the consideration of the trouble caused me by the simplicity
of Gregory of Nyssa,2353 who is summoning a Synod at Ancyra and leaving nothing undone

<head>Consolatory.2355</head>
<p>This is my first letter to you, and I could have prayed that its subject were a brighter
one. Had it been so, things would have fallen out as I desire, for it is my wish that the life
of all those who are purposed to live in true religion should be happily spent. But the Lord,
Who ordains our course in accordance with His ineffable wisdom, has arranged that all
these things should come about for the advantage of our souls, whereby He has, on the one
hand, made your life sorrowful, and on the other, roused the sympathy of one who, like
myself, is united to you in godly love. Therefore on my learning from my brothers what
has befallen you it has seemed to me that I could not but give you such comfort as I can.
Had it indeed been possible to me to travel to the place in which you are now living I would
have made every effort to do so. But my bad health and the present business which occupies
me have caused this very journey, which I have undertaken, to be injurious to the interests
of my Church. I have, therefore, determined to address your excellency in writing, to remind
you that these afflictions are not sent by the Lord, Who rules us, to the servants of God to
no purpose, but as a test of the genuineness of our love to the divine Creator. Just as athletes
win crowns by their struggles in the arena, so are Christians brought to perfection by the
trial of their temptations, if only we learn to accept what is sent us by the Lord with becoming
patience, with all thanksgiving. All things are ordained by the Lord’s love. We must not
accept anything that befalls us as grievous, even if, for the present, it affects our weakness.
We are ignorant, peradventure, of the reasons why each thing that happens to us is sent to
us as a blessing by the Lord but we ought to be convinced that all that happens to us is for
our good, either for the reward of our patience, or for the soul which we have received, lest,
by lingering too long in this life, it be filled with the wickedness to be found in this world.
If the hope of Christians is limited to this life, it might rightly have been reckoned a bitter
lot to be prematurely parted from the body; but if, to them that love God, the sundering of
the soul from these bodily fetters is the beginning of our real life, why do we grieve like them
which have no hope?2356 Be comforted then, and do not fall under your troubles, but show
that you are superior to them and can rise above them.</p>

<p>Moved by your importunity and that of all your people, I have undertaken the charge
of your Church, and have promised before the Lord that I will be wanting to you in nothing
which is within my power. So I have been compelled, as it is written, to touch as it were the
apple of my eye.2359 Thus the high honour in which I hold you has suffered me to remember
neither relationship, nor the intimacy which I have had from my boyhood with the person
in question, as making a stronger demand on me than your request. I have forgotten all the
private considerations which made him near and dear to me, making no account of the
sighs which will be heaved by all my people on being deprived of his rule, none of the tears
of all his kindred; nor have I taken to heart the affliction of his aged mother, who is supported
by his aid alone. All these considerations, great and many as they are, I have put aside,
keeping only in view the one object of giving your Church the blessing of the rule of such
a man, and of aiding her, now distressed as she is, at being so long without a head, and
needing great and powerful support to be enabled to rise again. So much for what concerns
myself. Now, on the other hand, I ask you not to fall short of the hope which I have entertained
and of the promises which I have made him, that I have sent him to close friends. I
ask every one of you to try to surpass the rest in love and affection to him. I entreat you to
show this laudable rivalry, and to comfort his heart by the greatness of your attentions to
him, that he may forget his own home, forget his kinsfolk, and forget a people so dependent
on his rule, like a child weaned from his mother’s breast.</p>

<p>Merely to write to so great a man, even though there be no other reason, must be esteemed
a great honour. For communication with personages of high distinction confers
glory upon all to whom it is permitted. My supplication, however, is one which I am driven
by necessity to make to your excellency, in my great distress at the condition of my whole
country. Bear with me, I beg you, kindly and in accordance with your own characters and
reach a helping hand to my country, now beaten to the knee. The immediate object of my
entreaty is as follows. By the old census, the clergy of God, presbyters and deacons,2364
were left exempt. The recent registrars, however, without any authority from your lordship,
have enrolled them, except that in some cases a few were granted immunity on the score of
age. I ask, then, that you will leave us this memorial of your beneficence, to preserve through
all coming time your good fame; that in accordance with the old law the clergy be exempt
from contribution. I do not ask the remission to be conceded personally and individually
to those who are now included, in which case the grace will pass to their successors, who
may not always be worthy of the sacred ministry. I would suggest that some general concession
be made to the clergy, according to the form in the open register, so that the exemption
may be given in each place to ministers by the rulers of the Church. This boon is sure to
bring undying glory to your excellency for your good deeds, and will cause many to pray
for the imperial house. It will also really be profitable to the government, if we afford the
relief of exemption, not generally to all the clergy, but to those who from time to time are
in distress. This, as any one who chooses may know, is the course we actually pursue when
we are at liberty.</p>

and when I was disappointed I could not easily bear it. When, I said, will it be possible for
me to be in your neighbourhood again? When will it be agreeable to you to come into

that my son Sophronius was setting out to you, I gladly delivered him this letter, to convey
you my salutation, and to tell you how, by God’s grace, I do not cease to remember you,
and to thank the Lord on your behalf, in that you are goodly scions of a goodly stock, fruitful
in good works, and verily like lilies among thorns. Surrounded as you are by the terrible
perversity of them that are corrupting the word of truth, you do not give in to their wiles;
you have not abandoned the apostolic proclamation of faith, you have not gone over to the
successful novelty of the day. Is not this cause of deep thankfulness to God? Shall not this
rightly bring you great renown? You have professed your faith in Father, Son and Holy
Ghost. Do not abandon this deposit; the Father—origin of all; the Son—Only begotten,
begotten of Him, very God, Perfect of Perfect, living image, shewing the whole Father in
Himself; the Holy Ghost, having His subsistence of God, the fount of holiness, power that
gives life, grace that maketh perfect, through Whom man is adopted, and the mortal made
immortal, conjoined with Father and Son in all things in glory and eternity, in power and
kingdom, in sovereignty and godhead; as is testified by the tradition of the baptism of salvation.</p>
<p>But all who maintain that either Son or Spirit is a creature, or absolutely reduce the
Spirit to ministerial and servile rank, are far removed from the truth. Flee their communion.
Turn away from their teaching. They are destructive to souls. If ever the Lord grant us to
meet, I will discourse to you further concerning the faith, to the end that you may perceive
at once the power of the truth and the rottenness of heresy by Scriptural proof.</p>

wrote also to Helladius, who is of the household of the prefect, that information might be
given through him about your affairs. I hesitated myself to make so free with an officer of
such importance, on account of my never having yet written to him about my own private

you made before me and the ex-prefect. You said that you were naming a shorter time in
writing, but that you would grant a longer term of grace, from your wish to meet the necessities
of the case, and do a favour to the widow, who is now compelled to pay out of her
substance such a large sum of money at once. What is the cause of this change I cannot
imagine. However, whatever it is, I beg you to be mindful of your own generous character,
and to look to the Lord Who requites good deeds. I beg you to grant the time of remission,
which you promised at the outset, that they may be able to sell their property and discharge
the debt. I perfectly well remember that you promised, if you received the sum agreed on,
to restore to the widow all the stipulated documents, as well those which had been executed
before the magistrates as the private papers. I do beg you then, honour me and win great

<head>To the prefect Modestus.2374</head>
<p>In kindly condescending to come down to me you give me great honour and allow me
great freedom; and these in like, aye and in greater, measure, I pray that your lordship may
receive from our good Master during the whole of your life. I have long wanted to write to
you and to receive honour at your hands, but respect for your great dignity has restrained
me, and I have been careful lest I should ever seem to abuse the liberty conceded to me.
Now, however, I am forced to take courage, not only by the fact of my having received permission
from your incomparable excellency to write, but also by the necessity of the distressed.
If, then, prayers of even the small are of any avail with the great, be moved, most
excellent sir, of your good will to grant relief to a rural population now in pitiable case, and
give orders that the tax of iron, paid by the inhabitants of iron-producing Taurus, may be
made such as it is possible to pay. Grant this, lest they be crushed once for all, instead of
being of lasting service to the state. I am sure that your admirable benevolence will see that
this is done.</p>

<head>To Modestus, the prefect.</head>
<p>Under any ordinary circumstances I should have lacked courage to intrude upon your
excellency, for I know how to gauge my own importance and to recognise dignities. But
now that I have seen a friend in a distressing position at having been summoned before you,
I have ventured to give him this letter. I hope that by using it, as a kind of propitiatory
symbol, he may meet with merciful consideration. Truly, although I am of no account,
moderation itself may be able to conciliate the most merciful of prefects, and to win pardon
for me. Thus if my friend has done no wrong, he may be saved by the mere force of truth;
if he has erred, he may be forgiven through my entreaty.</p>
<p>How we are situated here no one knows better than yourself, for you discern the weak
parts in each man and rule all with your admirable forethought.</p>

<head>Letter CXII.2376</head>
<head>To Andronicus, a general.2377</head>
<p>1. Did but my health allow of my being able to undertake a journey without difficulty,
and of putting up with the inclemency of the winter, I should, instead of writing, have
travelled to your excellency in person, and this for two reasons. First to pay my old debt,
for I know that I promised to come to Sebastia and to have the pleasure of seeing your excellency;
I did indeed come, but I failed to meet you because I arrived a little later than your
lordship; secondly, to be my own ambassador, because I have hitherto shrunk from sending,
from the idea that I am too insignificant to win such a boon, and at the same time reckoning
that no one by merely writing would be so likely to persuade any one of public or private
rank, in behalf of any one, as by a personal interview, in which one might clear up some
points in the charges, as to others make entreaty, and for others implore pardon; none of
which ends can be easily achieved by a letter. Now against all this I can only set one thing,
your most excellent self; and because it will suffice to tell you my mind in the matter, and
all that is wanting you will add of yourself, I have ventured to write as I do.</p>
<p>2. But you see how from my hesitation, and because I put off explaining the reasons of
my pleading, I write in roundabout phrase. This man Domitianus has been an intimate
friend of my own and of my parents from the beginning, and is like a brother to me. Why
should I not speak the truth? When I learnt the reasons for his being in his present troubles,
I said that he had only got what he deserved. For I hoped that no one who has ever committed
any offence be it small or great, will escape punishment. But when I saw him living a
life of insecurity and disgrace, and felt that his only hope depends on your decision, I thought
that he had been punished enough; and so I implore you to be magnanimous and humane
in the view you take of his case. To have one’s opponents under one’s power is right and
proper for a man of spirit and authority; but to be kind and gentle to the fallen is the mark
of the man supereminent in greatness of soul, and in inclemency. So, if you will, it is in
your power to exhibit your magnanimity in the case of the same man, both in punishing
him and in saving him. Let the fear Domitian has of what he suspects, and of what he knows
he deserves to suffer, be the extent of his chastisement. I entreat you to add nothing to his
punishment, for consider this: many in former times, of whom no record has reached us,
have had those who wronged them in their power. But those who surpassed their fellows
in philosophy did not persist in their wrath, and of these the memory has been handed
down, immortal through all time. Let this glory be added to what history will say of you.
Grant to us, who desire to celebrate your praises, to be able to go beyond the instances of

<note type="footnote">2377 Asking for the merciful consideration of Domitianus, a friend of Basil.</note>

kindnesses sung of in days of old. In this manner Croesus, it is said, ceased from his wrath
against the slayer of his son, when he gave himself up for punishment,2378 and the great
Cyrus was friendly to this very Croesus after his victory.2379 We shall number you with
these and shall proclaim this your glory, with all our power, unless we be counted too poor
heralds of so great a man.</p>
<p>3. Yet another plea that I ought to urge is this, that we do not chastise transgressors for
what is past and gone, (for what means can be devised for undoing the past?) but either that
they may be reformed for the future, or may be an example of good behaviour to others.
Now, no one could say that either of these points is lacking in the present case; for Domitian
will remember what has happened till the day of his death; and I think that all the rest, with
his example before them, are dead with alarm. Under these circumstances any addition
which we make to his punishment will only look like a satisfaction of our own anger. This
I should say is far from being true in your case. I could not indeed be induced to speak of
such a thing did I not see that a greater blessing comes to him that gives, than to him that
receives. Nor will your magnanimity be known only to a few. All Cappadocia is looking
to see what is to be done, and I pray that they may be able to number this among the rest
of your good deeds. I shrink from concluding my letter for fear any omission may be to my
hurt. But one thing I will add. Domitian has letters from many, who plead for him, but he
thinks mine the most important of all, because he has learnt, from whom I know not, that
I have influence with your excellency. Do not let the hopes he has placed in me be blasted;
do not let me lose my credit among my people here; be entreated, illustrious sir, and grant
my boon. You have viewed human life as clearly as ever philosopher viewed it, and you
know how goodly is the treasure laid up for all those who give their help to the needy.</p>

<head>Letter CXIII.2380</head>
<head>To the presbyters of Tarsus.2381</head>
<p>On meeting this man, I heartily thanked God that by means of his visit He had comforted
me in many afflictions and had through him shewn me clearly your love. I seem to see in
one man’s disposition the zeal of all of you for the truth. He will tell you of our discourses
with one another. What you ought to learn directly from me is as follows.</p>
<p>We live in days when the overthrow of the Churches seems imminent; of this I have
long been cognisant. There is no edification of the Church; no correction of error; no
sympathy for the weak; no single defence of sound brethren; no remedy is found either to
heal the disease which has already seized us, or as a preventive against that which we expect.
Altogether the state of the Church (if I may use a plain figure though it may seem too humble
an one) is like an old coat, which is always being torn and can never be restored to its original
strength. At such a time, then, there is need of great effort and diligence that the Churches
may in some way be benefited. It is an advantage that parts hitherto severed should be
united. Union would be effected if we were willing to accommodate ourselves to the
weaker, where we can do so without injury to souls; since, then, many mouths are open
against the Holy Ghost, and many tongues whetted to blasphemy against Him, we implore
you, as far as in you lies, to reduce the blasphemers to a small number, and to receive into
communion all who do not assert the Holy Ghost to be a creature, that the blasphemers
may be left alone, and may either be ashamed and return to the truth, or, if they abide in
their error, may cease to have any importance from the smallness of their numbers. Let us
then seek no more than this, but propose to all the brethren, who are willing to join us, the
Nicene Creed. If they assent to that, let us further require that the Holy Ghost ought not to
be called a creature, nor any of those who say so be received into communion. I do not
think that we ought to insist upon anything beyond this. For I am convinced that by longer
communication and mutual experience without strife, if anything more requires to be added
by way of explanation, the Lord Who worketh all things together for good for them that
love Him,2382 will grant it.</p>

<head>Letter CXIV.2383</head>
<head>To Cyriacus, at Tarsus.2384</head>
<p>I need hardly tell the sons of peace how great is the blessing of peace. But now this
blessing, great, marvellous, and worthy as it is of being most strenuously sought by all that
love the Lord, is in peril of being reduced to the bare name, because iniquity abounds, and
the love of most men has waxed cold.2385 I think then that the one great end of all who are
really and truly serving the Lord ought to be to bring back to union the Churches now “at
sundry times and in divers manners”2386 divided from one another. In attempting myself
to effect this, I cannot fairly be blamed as a busybody, for nothing is so characteristically
Christian as the being a peacemaker, and for this reason our Lord has promised us peacemakers
a very high reward.</p>
<p>When, therefore, I had met the brethren, and learnt how great was their brotherly love,
their regard for you, and yet more their love for Christ, and their exactitude and firmness
in all that concerns the faith, and moreover their earnestness in compassing two ends, the
not being separated from your love, and the not abandoning their sound faith, I approved
of their good disposition; and I now write to your reverence beseeching you with all love to
retain them in true union, and associated with you in all your anxiety for the Church. I
have moreover pledged myself to them for your orthodoxy, and that you too by God’s grace
are enrolled to fight with all vigour for the truth, whatever you may have to suffer for the
true doctrine. My own opinion is that the following conditions are such as will not run
counter to your own feeling and will be quite sufficient to satisfy the above mentioned
brethren; namely, that you should confess the faith put forth by our Fathers once assembled
at Nicæa, that you should not omit any one of its propositions, but bear in mind that the
three hundred and eighteen who met together without strife did not speak without the operation
of the Holy Ghost, and not to add to that creed the statement that the Holy Ghost
is a creature, nor hold communion with those who so say, to the end that the Church of
God may be pure and without any evil admixture of any tare. If this full assurance is given
them by your good feeling, they are prepared to offer proper submission to you. And I
myself promise for the brethren that they will offer no opposition, but will show themselves
entirely subordinate, if only your excellency shall have readily granted this one thing which
they ask for.</p>

<head>Letter CXV.2387</head>
<head>To the heretic Simplicia.2388</head>
<p>We often ill advisedly hate our superiors and love our inferiors. So I, for my part, hold
my tongue, and keep silence about the disgrace of the insults offered me. I wait for the Judge
above, Who knows how to punish all wickedness in the end, even though a man pour out
gold like sand; let him trample on the right, he does but hurt his own soul. God always asks
for sacrifice, not, I think, because He needs it, but because He accepts a pious and right mind
as a precious sacrifice. But when a man by his transgressions tramples on himself God
reckons his prayers impure. Bethink thyself, then, of the last day, and pray do not try to
teach me. I know more than you do, and am not so choked with thorns within. I do not
mind tenfold wickedness with a few good qualities. You have stirred up against me lizards
and toads,2389 beasts, it is true, of Spring time, but nevertheless unclean. But a bird will
come from above who will devour them. The account I have to render is not according to
your ideas, but as God thinks fit to judge. If witnesses are wanted, there will not stand before
the Judge slaves; nor yet a disgraceful and detestable set of eunuchs; neither woman nor
man, lustful, envious, ill-bribed, passionate, effeminate, slaves of the belly, mad for gold,
ruthless, grumbling about their dinner, inconstant, stingy, greedy, insatiable, savage, jealous.
What more need I say? At their very birth they were condemned to the knife. How can
their mind be right when their feet are awry? They are chaste because of the knife, and it is
no credit to them. They are lecherous to no purpose, of their own natural vileness. These
are not the witnesses who shall stand in the judgment, but rather the eyes of the just and

<note type="footnote">2388 The Ben. E. note that in the imperial codex No. lxvii. appears an argument of this letter wanting in the
editions of St. Basil. It is as follows: “Letter of the same to Simplicia about her eunuchs. She was a heretic. The
blessed Basil being ill and entering a bath to bathe, Simplicia told her eunuchs and maids to throw his towels
out. Straightway the just judgment of God slew some of them, and Simplicia sent money to the blessed Basil to
make amends for the injury. Basil refused to receive it, and wrote this Letter.” This extraordinary preface seems
to have been written by some annotator ignorant of the circumstances, which may be learnt from Greg. Naz.
Letter xxxviii. It appears that a certain Cappadocian church, long without a bishop, had elected a slave of Simplicia,
a lady wealthy and munificent, but of suspected orthodoxy. Basil and Gregory injudiciously ordained
the reluctant slave without waiting for his mistress’s consent. The angry lady wrote in indignation, and threatened
him with the vengeance of her slaves and eunuchs. After Basil’s death she returned to the charge, and pressed
Gregory to get the ordination annulled. cf. Maran, Vit. Bas. chap. xxv.</note>

<p>You write seldom, and your letters are short, either because you shrink from writing or
from avoiding the satiety that comes from excess; or perhaps to train yourself to curt speech.
I, indeed, am never satisfied and however abundant be your communication, it is less than
my desire, because I wish to know every detail about you. How are you as to health? How
as to ascetic discipline? Do you persevere in your original purpose? Or have you formed
some new plan, changing your mind according to circumstances? Had you remained the
same, I should not have wanted a great number of letters. I should have been quite satisfied
with “I am quite well and I hope you are quite well.” But I hear what I am ashamed to say,
that you have deserted the ranks of your blessed forefathers, and deserted to your paternal
grandfather, and are anxious to be rather a Brettanius than a Firminius. I am very anxious
to hear about this, and to learn the reasons which have induced you to take to this kind of
life. You have yourself been silent; ashamed, I suppose, of your intentions, and therefore I
must implore you not to entertain any project, which can be associated with shame. If any
such idea has entered into your mind, put it from you, come to yourself again, bid a long
farewell to soldiering and arms and the toils of the camp. Return home thinking it, as your
forefathers thought before you, quite enough for ease of life and all possible distinction to
hold a high place in your city. This, I am sure, you will be able to achieve without difficulty,
when I consider your natural gifts and the small number of your rivals. If, then, this was
not your original intention, or if after forming it you have rejected it, let me know at once.
If, on the other hand, which God forbid, you remain in the same mind, let the trouble come
self announced. I do not want a letter.</p>

<p>For many reasons I know that I am a debtor to your reverence, and now the anxiety in

own difficulties, by determining to leave that good discipline which alone leads to salvation.
The result was that in this trouble I soon fell into temptation. What happened has seemed
worthy of mention, so that I may not again fall into similar distress. As to the future, I wish
to give full assurance to your reverence, that, by God’s grace, all will go well, since the proceeding
is lawful, and there is no difficulty about it, as many of my friends about the court
are ready to help me. I shall therefore have a petition drawn up, similar to the form
presented to the Vicar; and, if no delay intervene, I shall promptly get my discharge, and
shall be sure to give you relief by sending you the formal document. I feel sure that in this
my own convictions have more force than the imperial orders. If I shew this fixed and firm

<head>To Eustathius, Bishop of Sebasteia.2396</head>
<p>I address you by the very honourable and reverend brother Petrus, beseeching you now
and ever to pray for me, that I may be changed from ways dangerous and to be shunned,
and may be made one day worthy of the name of Christ. Though I say nothing, you will
converse together about my affairs, and he will give you an exact account of what has taken
place. But you admit without due examination, the vile suspicions against me which will
probably be raised by men who have insulted me, in violation of the fear of God and the
regard of men. I am ashamed to tell you what treatment I have received from the illustrious
Basilius, whom I had accepted at the hands of your reverence as a protection for my life.
But, when you have heard what our brother has to say, you will know every detail. I do not
thus speak to avenge myself upon him, for I pray that it may not be put to his account by
the Lord, but in order that your affection to me may remain firm, and because I am afraid
lest it be shaken by the monstrous slanders which these men are pretty sure to make up in
defence of their fall. Whatever be the charges they adduce, I hope your intelligence will put
these enquiries to them. Have they formally accused me? Have they sought for any correction
of the error which they bring against me? Have they made their grievance against me
plain? As matters are, by their ignoble flight they have made it evident that under the
cheerfulness of their countenance, and their counterfeit expressions of affection, they are
all the while hiding in their heart an immense depth of guile and of gall. In all this, whether
I narrate it or not, your intelligence knows perfectly well what sorrow they have caused me,
and what laughter to those who, always expressing their abomination for the pious life in
this wretched city, affirm that the pretence of virtue is practised as a mere trick to get credit,
a mere assumption to deceive. So in these days no mode of life is now so suspected of vice
by people here as the profession of asceticism. Your intelligence will consider what is the
best cure for all this.</p>
<p>As to the charges patched up against me by Sophronius, far from being a prelude of
blessings, they are a beginning of division and separation, and are likely to lead to even my
love growing cold. I implore that by your merciful kindness he may be withheld from his
injurious efforts, and that your affection may strive rather to tighten the bonds of what is
falling asunder, and not to increase separation by joining with those who are eager for dissent.</p>

<head>To Meletius, bishop of Antioch.2398</head>
<p>I have received a letter from the very God-beloved bishop Eusebius, in which he enjoins
that a second letter be written to the Westerns about certain Church matters. He has expressed
a wish that the letter should be drawn up by me, and signed by all those who are in
communion. Having no means of writing a letter about these wishes of his, I have sent on
his minute to your holiness, in order that, when you have read it and can give heed to the
information given by the very dear brother Sanctissimus, our fellow presbyter, you may
yourself be so good as to indite a letter on these points as seems best to you. We are prepared
to agree to it and to lose no time in having it conveyed to those in communion with us, so
that, when all have signed it may be carried by the messenger, who is on the point of starting
on his journey to visit the bishops of the West. Give orders for the decision of your holiness
to be communicated to me as quickly as possible, that I may not be ignorant of your intentions.</p>
<p>As to the intrigue which is now being devised, or has already been devised against me,
in Antioch, the same brother will convey intimation to your holiness, unless indeed the report
of what has been done does not anticipate him and make the position clear. There is ground
for hope that the threats are coming to an end.</p>
<p>I wish your reverence to know that our brother Anthimus has ordained Faustus, who
is living with the pope2399 as bishop, without having received the votes, and in place of our
right reverend brother Cyril. Thus he has filled Armenia with schisms. I have thought it
right to tell your reverence this, lest they should lie against me, and I be responsible for these
disorderly proceedings. You will of course deem it right to make this known to the rest. I
think such irregularity will distress many.</p>

Basil’s opponent, Anthimus of Tyana. Sanctissimus, the bearer of the letter, is supposed by Tillemont (vol. ix.
p. 219) to be a Western on account of his Latin name. Maran (Vit. Bas. 26) points out that Orientals not infrequently

<head>To Poemenius,2403 bishop of Satala.</head>
<p>When the Armenians returned by your way you no doubt asked for a letter from them,
and you learnt why I had not given the letter to them. If they spoke as truth lovers should,
you forgave me on the spot; if they kept anything back (which I do not suppose), at all events
hear it from me.</p>
<p>The most illustrious Anthimus, who long ago made peace with me, when he found an
opportunity of satisfying his own vain gloriousness, and of causing me some vexation,
consecrated Faustus, by his own authority and with his own hand, without waiting for any
election from you, and ridiculing my punctiliousness in such matters. Inasmuch, then, as
he has confounded ancient order and has made light of you, for whose election I was waiting,
and has acted in a manner, as I view it, displeasing to God, for these reasons I felt pained
with them, and gave no letter for any of the Armenians, not even for your reverence.
Faustus I would not even receive into communion, thereby plainly testifying that, unless he
brought me a letter from you, I should be permanently alienated from him, and should influence
those of the same mind with me to treat him in the same manner. If there is any

<p>You were to have come to see me (and the blessing was drawing near) to cool me, aflame
in my temptations, with the tip of your finger. What then? My sins stood in the way and
hindered your start, so that I am sick without a remedy. Just as when the waves are round
us, one sinks and another rises, and another looms black and dreadful, so of my troubles:
some have ceased, some are with me, some are before me. As is generally the case, the one
remedy for these troubles is to yield to the crisis and withdraw from my persecutors. Yet
come to me, to console, to advise, or even to travel with me; in any case you will make me
better for the mere sight of you. Above all, pray, and pray again, that my reason be not
whelmed by the waves of my troubles; pray that all through I may keep a heart pleasing to
God, that I be not numbered with the wicked servants, who thank a master when he gives
them good, and refuse to submit when he chastises them by adversity; but let me reap benefit
from my very trials, trusting most in God when I need Him most.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that slaves to the passion of love, when by some inevitable necessity
they are separated from the object of their desire, are able to stay the violence of their passion
by indulging the sense of sight, if haply they can look at the picture of the beloved object.
Whether this be true or not I cannot say; but what has befallen me in your case, my friend,
is not very different. I have felt a disposition towards your godly and guileless soul, somewhat,
if I may so say, of the nature of love; but the gratification of my desire, like that of all other
blessings, is made difficult to me by the opposition of my sins. However, I have seemed to
see a very good likeness of you in the presence of my very reverend brothers. And if it had
been my lot to fall in with you when far away from them, I should have fancied that I saw
them in you. For the measure of love in each of you is so great, that in both of you there is
a plain contest for the superiority. I have thanked God for this. If any longer life be left me,
I pray that my life may be made sweet through you, just as now I look on life as a wretched
thing to be avoided, because I am separated from the companionship of those I love best.
For, in my judgment, there is nothing in which one can be cheerful when cut off from those
who truly love us.</p>

<head>Letter CXXV.2407</head>
<head>A transcript of the faith as dictated by Saint Basil, and subscribed by Eustathius, bishop of
Sebasteia.2408</head>
<p>1. Both men whose minds have been preoccupied by a heterodox creed and now wish
to change over to the congregation of the orthodox, and also those who are now for the first
time desirous of being instructed in the doctrine of truth, must be taught the creed drawn
up by the blessed fathers in the Council which met at Nicæa. The same training would also
be exceedingly useful in the case of all who are under suspicion of being in a state of hostility
to sound doctrine, and who by ingenious and plausible excuses keep the depravity of their
sentiments out of view. For these too this creed is all that is needed. They will either get
cured of their concealed unsoundness, or, by continuing to keep it concealed, will themselves
bear the load of the sentence due to their dishonesty, and will provide us with an easy defence
in the day of judgment, when the Lord will lift the cover from the hidden things of darkness,
and “make manifest the counsels of the hearts.”2409 It is therefore desirable to receive them
with the confession not only that they believe in the words put forth by our fathers at Nicæa,
but also according to the sound meaning expressed by those words. For there are men who
even in this creed pervert the word of truth, and wrest the meaning of the words in it to suit
their own notions. So Marcellus, when expressing impious sentiments concerning the hypostasis
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and describing Him as being Logos and nothing more,2410
had the hardihood to profess to find a pretext for his principles in that creed by affixing an
improper sense upon the Homoousion. Some, moreover, of the impious following of the
Libyan Sabellius, who understand hypostasis and substance to be identical, derive ground
for the establishment of their blasphemy from the same source, because of its having been
written in the creed “if any one says that the Son is of a different substance or hypostasis,
the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes him.” But they did not there state hypostasis
and substance to be identical. Had the words expressed one and the same meaning,
what need of both? It is on the contrary clear that while by some it was denied that the Son

was of the same substance with the Father, and some asserted that He was not of the substance
and was of some other hypostasis, they thus condemned both opinions as outside that held
by the Church. When they set forth their own view, they declared the Son to be of the sub-
stance of the Father, but they did not add the words “of the hypostasis.” The former clause
stands for the condemnation of the faulty view; the latter plainly states the dogma of salvation.
We are therefore bound to confess the Son to be of one substance with the Father, as
it is written; but the Father to exist in His own proper hypostasis, the Son in His, and the
Holy Ghost in His, as they themselves have clearly delivered the doctrine. They indeed
clearly and satisfactorily declared in the words Light of Light, that the Light which begat
and the Light which was begotten, are distinct, and yet Light and Light; so that the definition
of the Substance is one and the same.2411 I will now subjoin the actual creed as it was drawn
up at Nicæa.2412</p>

<note type="footnote">2411 cf. Letters xxxviii. and xcii. Basil is anxious to show that his own view is identical with the Nicene, and
does not admit a development and variation in the meaning of the word hypostasis; but on comparing such a
passage as that in Athan. c. Afros, “hypostasis is substance, and means nothing else but very being” (ἡ δὲ ὑπόστασις
οὐσία ἐστὶ καὶ οὐδὲν ἀλλὸ σημαινόμενον ἔχει ἢ αὐτὸ τὸ ὄν) with St. Basil’s words in the text it appears plain
that hypostasis is not used throughout in the same sense. An erroneous sense of “three hypostases” was understood
to be condemned at Nicæa, though Athanasius, e.g. “In illud omnia,” etc., Schaff and Wace’s ed., p. 90,
does himself use the phrase, writing probably about ten years after Nicæa; but he more commonly treats ουσία
and ὑπόστασις as identical. See specially the Tomus ad Antiochenos of a.d. 362 on the possible use of either
“three hypostases” or “one hypostasis.” cf. also n. on p. 179.</note>

<p>3. Here then all points but one are satisfactorily and exactly defined, some for the correction
of what had been corrupted, some as a precaution against errors expected to arise.
The doctrine of the Spirit, however, is merely mentioned, as needing no elaboration, because
at the time of the Council no question was mooted, and the opinion on this subject in the
hearts of the faithful was exposed to no attack. Little by little, however, the growing poisongerms
of impiety, first sown by Arius, the champion of the heresy, and then by those who
succeeded to his inheritance of mischief, were nurtured to the plague of the Church, and
the regular development of the impiety issued in blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. Under
these circumstances we are under the necessity of putting before the men who have no pity
for themselves, and shut their eyes to the inevitable threat directed by our Lord against
blasphemers of the Holy Ghost, their bounden duty. They must anathematize all who call
the Holy Ghost a creature, and all who so think; all who do not confess that He is holy by
nature, as the Father is holy by nature, and the Son is holy by nature, and refuse Him His
place in the blessed divine nature. Our not separating Him from Father and Son is a proof
of our right mind, for we are bound to be baptized in the terms we have received and to
profess belief in the terms in which we are baptized, and as we have professed belief in, so
to give glory to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and to hold aloof from the communion of all
who call Him creature, as from open blasphemers. One point must be regarded as settled;
and the remark is necessary because of our slanderers; we do not speak of the Holy Ghost
as unbegotten, for we recognise one Unbegotten and one Origin of all things,2414 the Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ: nor do we speak of the Holy Ghost as begotten, for by the tradition
of the faith we have been taught one Only-begotten: the Spirit of truth we have been taught
to proceed from the Father, and we confess Him to be of God without creation. We are also
bound to anathematize all who speak of the Holy Ghost as ministerial,2415 inasmuch as by
<note type="footnote">2414 cf. pp. 27 and 39, notes.</note>

this term they degrade Him to the rank of a creature. For that the ministering spirits are
creatures we are told by Scripture in the words “they are all ministering spirits sent forth to
minister.”2416 But because of men who make universal confusion, and do not keep the
doctrine of the Gospels, it is necessary to add yet this further, that they are to be shunned,
as plainly hostile to true religion, who invert the order left us by the Lord, and put the Son
before the Father, and the Holy Spirit before the Son. For we must keep unaltered and inviolable
that order which we have received from the very words of the Lord, “Go ye therefore
and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost.”2417</p>

<head>To Atarbius.2419</head>
<p>On arriving at Nicopolis in the double hope of settling the disturbances which had
arisen, and applying a remedy, as far as possible, to measures taken in a disorderly manner
and in violation of the law of the Church, I was exceedingly disappointed at failing to meet
you. I heard that you had hurriedly withdrawn, and actually from the very synod which
was being held by you. I am, therefore, under the necessity of having recourse to writing,
and by this letter I bid you present yourself before me, that you may in person apply some
remedy to the pain which I felt, even unto death, on hearing that you had ventured on action,
in the very middle of the church, of the like of which I hitherto have never heard. All this,
although painful and serious, is endurable, as having happened to a man who has committed
the punishment due for his sufferings to God, and is wholly devoted to peace and to preventing
harm falling from any fault of his on God’s people. Since, however, some honourable
brethren, worthy of all credit, have told me that you have introduced certain innovations
into the faith, and have spoken against sound doctrine, I am under the circumstances the
more agitated, and above measure anxious, lest, in addition to the countless wounds which
have been inflicted on the Church by traitors to the truth of the Gospel, yet a further
calamity should spring up in the renewal of the ancient heresy of Sabellius, the enemy of
the Church; for to this the brethren have reported your utterances to be akin. I have,
therefore, written to charge you not to shrink from undertaking a short journey to come to
me, and, by giving me full assurance in the matter, at once to alleviate my pangs, and to
solace the Churches of God, which are now pained to a grave, nay an unendurable extent,
at your actions and your reported words.</p>

<p>1. Hitherto I have been unable to give any adequate and practical proof of my earnest
desire to pacify the Churches of the Lord. But in my heart I affirm that I have so great a
longing, that I would gladly give up even my life, if thereby the flame of hatred, kindled by
the evil one, could be put out. If it was not for the sake of this longing for peace that I consented
to come to Colonia,2424 may my life be unblessed by peace. The peace I seek is the
true peace, left us by the Lord Himself; and what I have asked that I may have for my assur-
ance belongs to one who desires nothing but the true peace, although some perversely interpret
the truth into another sense. Let them use their tongues as they will, but assuredly they
will one day be sorry for their words.</p>
<p>2. Now I beseech your holiness to remember the original propositions, and not to be
led away by receiving answers that do not fit the questions, nor yet to give practical weight
to the quibbles of men who, without any power of argument, very cleverly pervert the truth,
from their own ideas alone. I set out propositions which were perfectly simple, clear and
easy to remember; do we decline to receive into communion those who refuse to accept the
Nicene Creed? Do we refuse to have part or lot with those who have the hardihood to assert
that the Holy Ghost is a creature? He, however,2425 instead of answering my questions
word for word, has concocted the statement which you have sent me:—and this not from
simplemindedness, as might be imagined, nor yet from his inability to see the consequences.
What he reckons is that, by repudiating my proposition, he will expose his true character
to the people; while, if he agrees to it, he will depart from that via media which has hitherto
seemed to him preferable to any other position. Let him not try to beguile me, nor, with
the rest, deceive your intelligence. Let him send a concise answer to my question, whether
he accepts or repudiates communion with the enemies of the faith. If you get him to do
this and send me such a distinct answer as I pray for, I own myself in error in all that has
gone before; I take all the blame upon myself; then ask from me a proof of humility. But,
if nothing of the kind come to pass, pardon me, most God-beloved father, in my inability
to approach God’s altar with hypocrisy. Were it not for this dread, why should I separate
myself from Euippius, so learned a man, so advanced in age, and bound to me by so many
ties of affection? If, however, in this case I acted rightly, it would, I am sure, be absurd to

appear united with those who maintain the same views as Euippius, through the mediation

receive the faith, but rather to have regard to them in accordance with the old law of love,
and to write to them with one consent, giving them all exhortation with pity, and to propose
to them the faith of the fathers, and invite them to union. If we succeed we should be united
in communion with them; if we fail we must be content with one another and purge our
conduct of this uncertain spirit, restoring the evangelical and simple conversation followed
by those who accepted the Word from the beginning. “They,” it is said, “were of one heart
and of one soul.”2426 If they obey you, this will be best; if not, recognise the real authors of
the war, and, for the future do not write me any more letters about reconciliation.</p>

<head>Letter CXXIX.2427</head>
<head>To Meletius Bishop of Antioch.2428</head>
<p>1. I knew that the charge which had lately sprung up against the loquacious Apollinarius
would sound strange in the ears of your excellency. I did not know myself, till now, that he
was accused; at the present time, however, the Sebastenes, after search in some quarter or
another, have brought these things forward, and they are carrying about a document for
which they are specially trying to condemn me on the ground that I hold the same sentiments.
It contains the following phrases. “Wherefore it is everywhere necessary to understand
the first identity in conjunction with, or rather in union with, the second, and to say
that the second and the third are the same. For what the Father is firstly, the Son is secondly,
and the Spirit thirdly. And, again, what the Spirit is firstly, the Son is secondly, in so far as
the Spirit is the Lord; and the Father thirdly, in so far as the Spirit is God. And, to express
the ineffable with greatest force, the Father is Son in a paternal sense, and the Son Father in
a filial sense, and so in the case of the Spirit, in so far as the Trinity is one God.” This is
what is being bruited about. I never can believe it to have been invented by those through
whom it has been published, although, after their slanders against me, I can regard nothing
as beyond their audacity. For writing to some of their party, they advanced their false accusation
against me, and then added the words I have quoted, describing them as the work of
heretics, but saying nothing as to the author of the document, in order that it might vulgarly
be supposed to have come from my pen. Nevertheless, in my opinion, their intelligence
would not have gone far enough in putting the phrases together. On this account, in order
to repudiate the growing blasphemy against myself, and shew to all the world that I have
nothing in common with those who make such statements, I have been compelled to mention
Apollinarius as approximating to the impiety of Sabellius. Of this subject I will say no more.</p>
<p>2. I have received a message from the court that, after the first impulse of the Emperor,
to which he was impelled by my calumniators, a second decree has been passed, that I am
not to be delivered to my accusers, nor given over to their will, as was ordered at the beginning;
but that there has been in the meanwhile some delay. If then this obtains, or any
gentler measure is determined on, I will let you know. If the former prevails, it shall not be
so, without your knowledge.</p>
<p>3. Our brother Sanctissimus has certainly been with you a long time, and you have
learnt the objects he has in view. If, then, the letter to the Westerns seems to you to contain
at all what is requisite, be so good as to have it written out and conveyed to me, that I may
get it signed by those who think with us, and may keep the subscription ready, and written

out on a separate paper, which we can fasten on to the letter which is being carried about
by our brother and fellow presbyter. As I did not find in the minute anything conclusive,
I was in a difficulty on what point to write to the Westerns. Necessary points are anticipated,
and it is useless to write what is superfluous, and on such points would it not be ridiculous
to show feeling? One subject, however, did appear to me to be hitherto untouched, and to
suggest a reason for writing, and that was an exhortation to them not indiscriminately to
accept the communion of men coming from the East; but, after once choosing one side, to
receive the rest on the testimony of their fellows, and not to assent to every one writing a
form of creed on the pretext of orthodoxy. If they do so, they will be found in communion
with men at war with one another, who often put forward the same formulæ, and yet battle
vehemently against one another, as those who are most widely separated. To the end, then,
that the heresy may not be the more widely kindled, while those who are at variance with
one another mutually object to their own formulæ, they ought to be exhorted to make a
distinction between the acts of communion which are brought them by chance comers, and
those which are duly drawn up according to the rule of the Church.2429</p>

This neglect is really not due to any contempt on my part for the way in which he has treated
me, but simply to the fact that the story is now published abroad in all men’s ears, and
nobody needs any instructions from me in order to learn what his intentions are. For this
he has had good heed, as though he were really afraid that he would have few witnesses of
his opinion, and has sent to the ends of the earth the letter which he has written against me.
He has therefore severed himself from communion with me. He did not consent to meet
me at the appointed spot, and did not bring his disciples, as he had promised. On the contrary,
he publicly stigmatized me in the public synods, with the Cilician Theophilus,2431 by
the open and undisguised slander of sowing in the souls of the people doctrines at variance
with his own teaching. This was quite enough to break up all union between us. Afterwards
he came to Cilicia, and, on meeting with a certain Gelasius, showed him the creed which
only an Arian, or a thorough disciple of Arius, could subscribe. Then, indeed, I was yet
more confirmed in my alienation from him. I felt that the Ethiopian will never change his
skin, nor the leopard his spots,2432 nor a man nurtured in doctrines of perversity ever be
able to rub off the stain of his heresy.</p>
<p>2. In addition to all this he has had the impudence to write against me, or rather to
compose long discourses full of all kinds of abuse and calumny. To these, up to this time,
I have answered nothing, taught as we are by the Apostle, not to avenge ourselves, but to
give place unto wrath.2433 Moreover, at the thought of the depth of the hypocrisy with
which he has all along approached me, I have, in a way, become speechless with amazement.
But, if all this had never happened, who would not feel horror and detestation of the fellow
at this fresh piece of audacity? Now, as I hear, if the report is really true and not a slanderous
invention, he has ventured to re-ordain certain men; a proceeding on which so far no heretic
has ventured. How then can I quietly endure such treatment? How can I look upon the
errors of the man as curable? Beware, then, of being led away by lies; do not be moved by
the suspicions of men who are prone to look at everything in a bad light, as though I were
making little of such things. For, be sure, my very dear and honourable friend, that I have

<head>Letter CXXXI.2436</head>
<head>To Olympius.2437</head>
<p>1. Truly unexpected tidings make both ears tingle. This is my case. These compositions
against me, which are being carried about, have fallen upon ears by this time pretty well
seasoned, on account of my having formerly received the letter, appropriate enough to my
sins, but which I should never have expected to be written by those who sent it. Nevertheless
what followed did seem to me so extraordinarily cruel as to blot out all that had gone before.
How could I fail to be driven almost out of my senses when I read the letter addressed to
the reverend brother Dazinas, full of outrageous insults and calumnies and of attacks against
me, as though I had been convicted of much pernicious designs against the Church?
Moreover proofs were forthwith offered of the truth of the calumnies against me, from the
document of whose authorship I am ignorant. Parts I recognise, I own, as having been
written by Apollinarius of Laodicea. These I had purposely not even ever read, but I had
heard of them from the report of others. Other portions I found included, which I had
never either read or heard of from any one else; of the truth of this there is a faithful witness
in heaven. How then can men who shun lies, who have learnt that love is the fulfilling of
the law, who profess to bear the burdens of the weak, have consented to bring these calumnies
against me and to condemn me out of other men’s writings? I have often asked myself this
question, but I cannot imagine the reason, unless it be, as I have said from the beginning,
that my pain in all this is a part of the punishment which is due to my sins.</p>
<p>2. First of all I sorrowed in soul that truths were lessened by the sons of men; in the
second place I feared for my own self, lest in addition to my other sins, I should become a
misanthrope, believing no truth and honour to be left in any man; if indeed those whom I
have most greatly trusted are proved to be so disposed both to me and to the truth. Be sure
then, my brother, and every one who is a friend of the truth, that the composition is not
mine; I do not approve of it, for it is not drawn up according to my views. Even if I did
write, a good many years ago, to Apollinarius or to any one else, I ought not to be blamed.
I find no fault myself if any member of any society has been cut off into heresy (and you
know perfectly well whom I mean though I mention nobody by name), because each man
will die in his own sin.</p>
<p>This is my reply to the document sent me, that you may know the truth, and make it
plain to all who wish not to hold the truth in unrighteousness. If it prove necessary to defend

with the soul’s eye, and to embrace you with genuine affection, and as it were, to be drawn
very near to you, and to come into close union with you in the communion of faith. I am
sure that you, disciple as you are of so great a man, and long associated with him, will walk
in the same spirit and follow the same doctrines of true religion. Under these circumstances
I address your excellency, and beseech you that among the other things in which you have
succeeded that great man, you will succeed him in love to me, that you will frequently write

what you wrote. A streamlet tells of its own spring, and so the manner of speech marks the

happened to me. For deeply anxious as I always was to receive a letter from your excellency,
when I had taken your letter into my hand and had read it, I was not so much pleased at
what you had written, as annoyed at reckoning up the loss I had suffered in your long silence.
Now that you have begun to write, pray do not leave off. You will give me greater pleasure
than men can give by sending much money to misers. I have had no writer with me, neither

<head>Letter CXXXV.2443</head>
<head>To Diodorus, presbyter of Antioch.2444</head>
<p>1. I have read the books sent me by your excellency. With the second I was delighted,
not only with its brevity, as was likely to be the case with a reader out of health and inclined
to indolence, but, because it is at once full of thought, and so arranged that the objections
of opponents, and the answers to them, stand out distinctly. Its simple and natural style
seems to me to befit the profession of a Christian who writes less for self-advertisement than
for the general good. The former work, which has practically the same force, but is much
more elaborately adorned with rich diction, many figures, and niceties of dialogue, seems
to me to require considerable time to read, and much mental labour, both to gather its
meaning and retain it in the memory. The abuse of our opponents and the support of our
own side, which are thrown in, although they may seem to add some charms of dialectic to
the treatise, do yet break the continuity of the thought and weaken the strength of the argument,
by causing interruption and delay. I know that your intelligence is perfectly well
aware that the heathen philosophers who wrote dialogues, Aristotle and Theophrastus, went
straight to the point, because they were aware of their not being gifted with the graces of
Plato. Plato, on the other hand, with his great power of writing, at the same time attacks
opinions and incidentally makes fun of his characters, assailing now the rashness and
recklessness of a Thrasymachus, the levity and frivolity of a Hippias, and the arrogance and
pomposity of a Protagoras. When, however, he introduces unmarked characters into his
dialogues, he uses the interlocutors for making the point clear, but does not admit anything
more belonging to the characters into his argument. An instance of this is in the Laws.</p>
<p>2. It is well for us too, who betake ourselves to writing, not from any vain ambition,
but from the design of bequeathing counsels of sound doctrine to the brethren, if we introduce
some character well known to all the world for presumption of manners, to interweave
into the argument some points in accordance with the quality of the character, unless indeed
we have no right at all to leave our work and to accuse men. But if the subject of the dialogue
be wide and general, digressions against persons interrupt its continuity and tend to no
good end. So much I have written to prove that you did not send your work to a flatterer,
but have shared your toil with a real brother. And I have spoken not for the correction of
what is finished, but as a precaution for the future; for assuredly one who is so accustomed
to write, and so diligent in writing, will not hesitate to do so; and the more so that there is

<head>To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.2446</head>
<p>1. In what state the good Isaaces has found me, he himself will best explain to you;
though his tongue cannot be tragic enough to describe my sufferings, so great was my illness.
However, any one who knows me ever so little, will be able to conjecture what it was. For,
if when I am called well, I am weaker even than persons who are given over, you may fancy
what I was when thus ill. Yet, since disease is my natural state, it would follow (let a fever
have its jest) that in this change of habit, my health became especially flourishing. But it is
the scourge of the Lord which goes on increasing my pain according to my deserts; therefore
I have received illness upon illness, so that now even a child may see that this shell of mine
must for certain fail, unless perchance, God’s mercy vouchsafe to me, in His long suffering,
time for repentance, and now, as often before, extricate me from evils beyond human cure.
This shall be, as it is pleasing to Him and good for myself.</p>
<p>2. I need hardly tell you how deplorable and hopeless is the condition of the Churches.
Now, for the sake of our own safety, we neglect our neighbour’s, and do not even seem able
to see that general disaster involves individual ruin. Least of all need I say this to one who,
like yourself, foresaw the future from afar, and has foretold and proclaimed it and has been
among the first to be roused, and to rouse the rest, writing letters, coming yourself in person,
leaving no deed undone, no word unspoken. I remember this in every instance, but yet we
are none the better off. Now, indeed, were not my sins in the way, (first of all, my dear
brother the reverend deacon Eustathius fell seriously ill and detained me two whole months,
looking day by day for his restoration to health; and then all about me fell sick; brother
Isaaces will tell you the rest; then last of all I myself was attacked by this complaint) I should
long ago have been to see your excellency, not indeed thereby to try to improve the general
state of affairs, but to get some good for myself from your society. I had made up my mind
to get out of the reach of the ecclesiastical artillery, because I am quite unprepared to meet
my enemies’ attacks. May God’s mighty hand preserve you for all of us, as a noble guardian
of the faith, and a vigilant champion of the Churches; and grant me, before I die, to meet
you for the comfort of my soul.</p>

<p>I do now really feel the loss which I suffer from being ill; so that, when such a man
succeeds to the government of my country, my having to nurse myself compels me to be
absent. For a whole month I have been undergoing the treatment of natural hot springs, in
the hope of drawing some benefit from them. But I seem to be troubling myself to no purpose
in my solitude, or indeed to be deservedly a laughing stock to mankind, for not heeding the

here in a proper manner. The house of our reverend mother Palladia is my own, for I am

as some disturbance has been raised about her house, I ask your excellency to postpone the
enquiry for a little while, and to wait till I come; not at all that justice may not be done, for
I had rather die ten thousand times than ask a favour of that kind from a judge who is a

<p>1. What was my state of mind, think you, when I received your piety’s letter? When I
thought of the feelings which its language expressed, I was eager to fly straight to Syria; but
when I thought of the bodily illness, under which I lay bound, I saw myself unequal, not
only to flying, but even to turning on my bed. This day, on which our beloved and excellent
brother and deacon, Elpidius, has arrived, is the fiftieth of my illness. I am much reduced
by the fever. For lack of what it might feed on, it lingers in this dry flesh as in an expiring
wick, and so has brought on a wasting and tedious illness. Next my old plague, the liver,
coming upon it, has kept me from taking nourishment, prevented sleep, and held me on
the confines of life and death, granting just life enough to feel its inflictions. In consequence
I have had recourse to the hot springs, and have availed myself of help from medical men.</p>
<p>But for all these the mischief has proved too strong. Perhaps another man might endure
it, but, coming as it did unexpectedly, no one is so stout as to bear it. Long troubled by it
as I have been, I have never been so distressed as now at being prevented by it from meeting
you and enjoying your true friendship. I know of how much pleasure I am deprived, although
last year I did touch with the tip of my finger the sweet honey of your Church.</p>

things with you and to learn many things from you. Here it is not possible even to find
genuine affection. And, could one even find a true friend, none can give counsel to me in
the present emergency with anything like the wisdom and experience which you have acquired
in your many labours on the Church’s behalf. The rest I must not write. I may,
however, safely say what follows. The presbyter Evagrius,2452 son of Pompeianus of Antioch,
who set out some time ago to the West with the blessed Eusebius, has now returned from
Rome. He demands from me a letter couched in the precise terms dictated by the Westerns.
My own he has brought back again to me, and reports that it did not give satisfaction to the
more precise authorities there. He also asks that a commission of men of repute may be
promptly sent, that they may have a reasonable pretext for visiting me. My sympathisers

to give to the Sebastenes; what attitude I should show to the propositions of Evagrius; all
these are questions to which I was anxious to get answers in a personal interview with you,

one soon coming this way, be so good as to give me your answer on them all. If not, pray

<p>1. I have already heard of the persecution in Alexandria and the rest of Egypt, and, as
might be expected, I am deeply affected. I have observed the ingenuity of the devil’s mode
of warfare. When he saw that the Church increased under the persecution of enemies and
flourished all the more, he changed his plan. He no longer carries on an open warfare, but
lays secret snares against us, hiding his hostility under the name which they bear, in order
that we may both suffer like our fathers, and, at the same time, seem not to suffer for Christ’s
sake, because our persecutors too bear the name of Christians. With these thoughts for a
long time we sat still, dazed at the news of what had happened, for, in sober earnest, both
our ears tingled on hearing of the shameless and inhuman heresy of your persecutors. They
have reverenced neither age, nor services to society,2458 nor people’s affection. They inflicted
torture, ignominy, and exile; they plundered all the property they could find; they were
careless alike of human condemnation and of the awful retribution to come at the hands of
the righteous Judge. All this has amazed me and all but driven me out of my senses. To my
reflections has been added this thought too; can the Lord have wholly abandoned His
Churches? Has the last hour come, and is “the falling away” thus coming upon us, that now
the lawless one “may be revealed, the son of perdition who opposeth and exalteth himself
above all that is called God and is worshipped”?2459 But if the temptation is for a season,
bear it, ye noble athletes of Christ. If the world is being delivered to complete, and final
destruction, let us not lose heart for the present, but let us await the revelation from heaven,
and the manifestation of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ. If all creation is to be
dissolved, and the fashion of this world transformed, why should we be surprised that we,
who are apart of creation, should feel the general woe, and be delivered to afflictions which
our just God inflicts on us according to the measure of our strength, not letting us “be
tempted above that we are able, but with the temptation giving us a way to escape that we
may be able to bear it”?2460 Brothers, martyrs’ crowns await you. The companies of the

mine has suffered from long sickness, and now is quite worn away with continuous affliction.
For no one can be so hard of heart, so wholly destitute of sympathy and kindness, as to hear
the sigh that strikes my ear from every quarter, as though from some sad choir chanting a
symphony of lamentation, without being grieved at heart, being bent to the ground, and
wasting away with these irremediable troubles. But the holy God is able to provide a remedy
for the irremediable, and to grant you a respite from your long toils. I should like you to

to fight for the truth? Then the righteous Giver of the prizes will not suffer us to be tried
above that which we are able to bear, but, in return for our previous struggles, will give us
the crown of patience and of hope in Him. Let us, therefore, not flinch from fighting a good
fight on behalf of the truth, nor, in despair, fling away the labours we have already achieved.
For the strength of the soul is not shewn by one brave deed, nor yet by effort only for a short
time; but He Who tests our hearts wishes us to win crowns of righteousness after long and
protracted trial. Only let our spirit be kept unbroken, the firmness of our faith in Christ be
maintained unshaken, and ere long our Champion will appear; He will come and will not
tarry. Expect tribulation after tribulation, hope upon hope; yet a little while; yet a little
while. Thus the Holy Ghost knows how to comfort His nurslings by a promise of the future.
After tribulations comes hope, and what we are hoping for is not far off, for let a man name
the whole of human life, it is but a tiny interval compared with the endless age which is laid
up in our hopes.</p>

the outcome of my own intelligence, lest I make the words of true religion merely
human words; but what I have been taught by the holy Fathers, that I announce to all who
question me. In my Church the creed written by the holy Fathers in synod at Nicæa is in
use. I believe that it is also repeated among you; but I do not refuse to write its exact terms

<head>To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.2467</head>
<p>1. I have now received two letters from your divine and most excellent wisdom,
whereof the one told me clearly how I had been expected by the laity under the jurisdiction
of your holiness, and what disappointment I had caused by failing to attend the sacred
synod. The other, which from the writing I conjecture to be of the earlier date, though it
was delivered later, gave me advice, at once honourable to yourself and necessary to me,
not to neglect the interests of God’s Churches, nor little by little to allow the guidance of
affairs to pass to our opponents, whereby their interests must win, and ours lose. I think
that I answered both. But, as I am uncertain whether my replies were preserved by those
who were entrusted with the duty of conveying them, I will make my defence over again.
As to my absence, I can put in an unimpeachable plea, as to which I think intelligence must
have reached your holiness, that I have been detained by illness which has brought me to
the very gates of death. Even now as I write about it, the remains of sickness are still upon
me. And they are such as to another man might be unendurable.</p>
<p>2. As to the fact of its not being owing to my neglect that the interests of the Churches
have been betrayed to our opponents, I wish your reverence to know that the bishops in
communion with me, from lack of earnestness, or because they suspect me and are not open
with me, or because the devil is always at hand to oppose good works, are unwilling to cooperate
with me. Formerly, indeed, the majority of us were united with one another, including
the excellent Bosporius.2468 In reality they give me no aid in what is most essential.
The consequence of all this is, that to a great extent my recovery is hindered by my distress,
and the sorrow I feel brings back my worst symptoms. What, however, can I do alone and
unaided, when the canons, as you yourself know, do not allow points of this kind to be
settled by one man?2469 And yet what remedy have I not tried? Of what decision have I

<head>To Aburgius.2485</head>
<p>Up to this time I used to think Homer a fable, when I read the second part of his poem,
in which he narrates the adventures of Ulysses. But the calamity which has befallen the
most excellent Maximus has led me to look on what I used to think fabulous and incredible,
as exceedingly probable. Maximus was governor of no insignificant people, just as Ulysses
was chief of the Cephallenians. Ulysses had great wealth, and returned stripped of
everything. To such straits has calamity reduced Maximus, that he may have to present
himself at home in borrowed rags. And perhaps he has suffered all this because he has irritated
some Læstrygones against him, and has fallen in with some Scylla, hiding a dog’s
fierceness and fury under a woman’s form. Since then he has barely been able to swim out
of this inextricable whirlpool. He supplicates you by my means for humanity’s sake to grieve
for his undeserved misfortunes and not be silent about his needs, but make them known to
the authorities. He hopes thus that he may find some aid against the slanders which have
been got up against him: and if not, that at all events the intention of the enemy who has
shewn such an intoxication of hostility against him may be made public. When a man has
been wronged it is a considerable comfort to him if the wickedness of his enemies can be

<p>Even the ability to bewail their own calamities brings much comfort to the distressed;
and this is specially the case when they meet with others capable, from their lofty character,
of sympathizing with their sorrows. So my right honourable brother Maximus, after being
prefect of my country, and then suffering what no other man ever yet suffered, stripped of
all his belongings both inherited from his forefathers and collected by his own labours, afflicted
in body in many and various ways, by his wanderings up and down the world, and
not having been able to keep even his civil status free from attack, to preserve which freemen
are wont to leave no labour undone, has made many complaints to me about all that has
happened to him, and has begged me to give you a short description of the Iliad of woes in
which he is involved. And I, being quite unable to relieve him in any other way in his
troubles, have readily done him the favour shortly to relate to your excellency a part of what
I have heard from him. He, indeed, seemed to me to blush at the idea of making a plain
tale of his own calamity. If what has happened shews that the inflicter of the wrong is a
villain, at all events it proves the sufferer to be deserving of great pity; since the very fact of
having fallen into troubles inflicted by Divine Providence, seems in a manner to shew that
a man has been devoted to suffering. But it would be a sufficient comfort to him if you will
only look at him kindly, and extend also to him that abundant favour which all the recipients
of it cannot exhaust,—I mean your clemency. We are all of us convinced that before the
tribunal your protection will be an immense step towards victory. He who has asked for

Would that he had never been so! Many, I think, would be likely to shun provincial governorships,
if their dignities are likely to issue in such an end. To a man, then, from the
quickness of his intelligence, able from a few circumstances to conjecture the rest, I need
hardly narrate in detail all that I have seen and all that I have heard. Perhaps, however, I
shall not seem to be telling a superfluous story if I mention that, though many and terrible
things were audaciously done against him before your coming, what went on afterwards
was such as to cause the former proceedings to be reckoned as kindness; to such an excess
of outrage and injury and actually of personal cruelty did the proceedings go which were
afterwards taken against him by the person in authority. Now he is here with an escort to
fill up the measure of his evil deeds unless you are willing to stretch out your strong hand
to protect the sufferer. In urging your goodness to an act of kindness I feel that I am undertaking

<p>To Amphilochius in the name of Heraclidas.2491</p>
<p>1. I remember our old conversations with one another, and am forgetful neither of
what I said, nor of what you said. And now public life has no hold upon me. For although
I am the same in heart and have not yet put off the old man, nevertheless, outwardly and
by withdrawing myself far from worldly life, I seem already to have begun to tread the way
of Christian conversation. I sit apart, like men who are on the point of embarking on the
deep, looking out at what is before me. Mariners, indeed, need winds to make their voyage
prosperous; I on the other hand want a guide to take me by the hand and conduct me safely
through life’s bitter waves. I feel that I need first a curb for my young manhood, and then
pricks to drive me to the course of piety. Both these seem to be provided by reason, which
at one time disciplines my unruliness of soul, and at another time my sluggishness. Again
I want other remedies that I may wash off the impurity of habit. You know how, long accustomed
as I was to the Forum, I am lavish of words, and do not guard myself against the
thoughts put into my mind by the evil one. I am the servant too of honour, and cannot
easily give up thinking great things of myself. Against all this I feel that I need a great instructor.
Then, further, I conclude that it is of no small importance, nor of benefit only for
a little while, that the soul’s eye should be so purged that, after being freed from all the
darkness of ignorance, as though from some blinding humour, one can gaze intently on the
beauty of the glory of God. All this I know very well that your wisdom is aware of; I know
that you would wish that I might have some one to give me such help, and if ever God grant
me to meet you I am sure that I shall learn more about what I ought to heed. For now, in
my great ignorance, I can hardly even form a judgment as to what I lack. Yet I do not repent
of my first impulse; my soul does not hang back from the purpose of a godly life as you have
feared for me, nobly and becomingly doing everything in your power, lest, like the woman
of whom I have heard the story, I should turn back and become a pillar of salt.2492 I am

you have made me laugh in this my dejection, because you are still an advocate and do not
give up your shrewdness. I hold, unless, indeed, like an ignorant man, I am quite missing
the truth, that there is only one way to the Lord, and that all who are journeying to Him are
travelling together and walking in accordance with one “bond” of life. If this be so, wherever
I go how can I be separated from you? How can I cease to live with you, and with you serve
God, to Whom we have both fled for refuge? Our bodies may be separated by distance, but
God’s eye still doubtless looks upon us both; if indeed a life like mine is fit to be beheld by
the divine eyes; for I have read somewhere in the Psalms that the eyes of the Lord are upon
the righteous.2493 I do indeed pray that with you and with all that are like minded with
you, I may be associated, even in body, and that night and day with you and with any other
true worshipper of God I may bow my knees to our Father which is in heaven; for I know
that communion in prayer brings great gain. If, as often as it is my lot to lie and groan in a
different corner, I am always to be accused of lying, I cannot contend against your argument,
and already condemn myself as a liar, if with my own carelessness I have said anything
which brings me under such a charge.</p>
<p>3. I was lately at Cæsarea, in order to learn what was going on there. I was unwilling
to remain in the city itself, and betook myself to the neighbouring hospital, that I might get
there what information I wanted. According to his custom the very godly bishop visited it,
and I consulted him as to the points which you had urged upon me. It is not possible for
me to remember all that he said in reply; it went far beyond the limits of a letter. In sum,
however, what he said about poverty was this, that the rule ought to be that every one should
limit his possessions to one garment. For one proof of this he quoted the words of John the
Baptist “he that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none;”2494 and for another
our Lord’s prohibition to His disciples to have two coats.2495 He further added “If thou
wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor.”2496 He said too that the
parable of the pearl bore on this point, because the merchant, who had found the pearl of
great price, went away and sold all that he had and bought it; and he added too that no one
ought even to permit himself the distribution of his own property, but should leave it in the
hands of the person entrusted with the duty of managing the affairs of the poor; and he
proved the point from the acts of the apostles,2497 because they sold their property and

brought and laid it at the feet of the apostles, and by them it was distributed to each as every
man had need.2498 For he said that experience was needed in order to distinguish between
cases of genuine need and of mere greedy begging. For whoever gives to the afflicted gives
to the Lord, and from the Lord shall have his reward; but he who gives to every vagabond
casts to a dog, a nuisance indeed from his importunity, but deserving no pity on the ground
of want.</p>
<p>4. He was moreover the first to speak shortly, as befits the importance of the subject,
about some of the daily duties of life. As to this I should wish you to hear from himself, for
it would not be right for me to weaken the force of his lessons. I would pray that we might
visit him together, that so you might both accurately preserve in your memory what he said,
and supply any omissions by your own intelligence. One thing that I do remember, out of
the many which I heard, is this; that instruction how to lead the Christian life depends less
on words, than on daily example. I know that, if you had not been detained by the duty of
succouring your aged father, there is nothing that you would have more greatly esteemed
than a meeting with the bishop, and that you would not have advised me to leave him in
order to wander in deserts. Caves and rocks are always ready for us, but the help we get
from our fellow man is not always at hand. If, then, you will put up with my giving you
advice, you will impress on your father the desirability of his allowing you to leave him for
a little while in order to meet a man who, alike from his experience of others and from his
own wisdom, knows much, and is able to impart it to all who approach him.</p>
<note type="footnote">2498 It will be observed that St. Basil’s quotation here does not quite bear out his point. There is no “by them”
in Acts iv. 35. “Distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.” In Acts ii. 45 the primitive
communists are said themselves to have “parted to all men as every man had need,” the responsibility of distribution
being apparently retained.</note>

<p>If my letters are of any good, lose no time in writing to me and in rousing me to write.
We are unquestionably made more cheerful when we read the letters of wise men who love
the Lord. It is for you to say, who read it, whether you find anything worth attention in
what I write. Were it not for the multitude of my engagements, I should not debar myself
from the pleasure of writing frequently. Pray do you, whose cares are fewer, soothe me by
your letters. Wells, it is said, are the better for being used. The exhortations which you
derive from your profession are apparently beside the point, for it is not I who am applying
the knife; it is men whose day is done, who are falling upon themselves.2501 The phrase of
the Stoics runs, “since things do not happen as we like, we like what happens;” but I cannot
make my mind fall in with what is happening. That some men should do what they do not
like because they cannot help it, I have no objection. You doctors do not cauterise a sick
man, or make him suffer pain in some other way, because you like it; but you often adopt
this treatment in obedience to the necessity of the case. Mariners do not willingly throw
their cargo overboard; but in order to escape shipwreck they put up with the loss, preferring
a life of penury to death. Be sure that I look with sorrow and with many groans upon the
separation of those who are holding themselves aloof. But yet I endure it. To lovers of the
truth nothing can be put before God and hope in Him.2502</p>

carelessness or forgetfulness. But it is not possible to forget you, when your name is in all
men’s mouths. But I cannot be careless about one who is perhaps more distinguished than
any one else in the empire. The cause of my silence is evident. I am afraid of troubling so
great a man. If, however, to all your other virtues you add that of not only receiving what
I send, but of actually asking after what is missing, lo! here I am writing to you with joyous
heart, and I shall go on writing for the future, with prayers to God that you may be requited
for the honour you pay me. For the Church, you have anticipated my supplications, by
doing everything which I should have asked. And you act to please not man but God, Who
has honoured you; Who has given you some good things in this life, and will give you others
in the life to come, because you have walked with truth in His way, and, from the beginning
to the end, have kept your heart fixed in the right faith.</p>

<p>You have done well, and in accordance with the law of spiritual love, in writing to me
first, and by your good example challenging me to like energy. The friendship of the world,
indeed, stands in need of actual sight and intercourse, that thence intimacy may begin. All,
however, who know how to love in the spirit do not need the flesh to promote affection, but
are led to spiritual communion in the fellowship of the faith. Thanks, then, to the Lord
Who has comforted my heart by showing me that love has not grown cold in all, but that
there are yet in the world men who show the evidence of the discipleship of Christ. The
state of affairs with you seems to be something like that of the stars by night, shining some
in one part of the sky and some in another, whereof the brightness is charming, and the
more charming because it is unexpected. Such are you, luminaries of the Churches, a few
at most and easily counted in this gloomy state of things, shining as in a moonless night,
and, besides being welcome for your virtue, being all the more longed for because of its being
so seldom that you are found. Your letter has made your disposition quite plain to me.
Although small, as far as regards the number of its syllables, in the correctness of its sentiments
it was quite enough to give me proof of your mind and purpose. Your zeal for the
cause of the blessed Athanasius is plain proof of your being sound as to the most important
matters. In return for my joy at your letter I am exceedingly grateful to my honourable son
Euphemius, to whom I pray that all help may be given by the Holy One, and I beg you to
join in my prayers that we may soon receive him back with his very honourable wife, my
daughter in the Lord. As to yourself, I beg that you will not stay our joy at its beginning,
but that you will write on every possible opportunity, and increase your good feeling towards
me by constant communication. Give me news, I beg you, about your Churches and how
they are situated as regards union. Pray for us here that our Lord may rebuke the winds
and the sea, and that with us there may be a great, calm.</p>

<p>Without address.2509 In the case of a trainer.</p>
<p>I am at a loss how to defend myself against all the complaints contained in the first and
only letter which your lordship has been so good as to send me. It is not that there is any
lack of right on my side, but because among so many charges it is hard to select the most
vital, and fix on the point at which I ought to begin to apply a remedy. Perhaps, if I follow
the order of your letter, I shall come upon each in turn. Up to to-day I knew nothing about
those who are setting out for Scythia; nor had any one told me even of those who came from
your house, so that I might greet you by them, although I am anxious to seize every opportunity
of greeting your lordship. To forget you in my prayers is impossible, unless first I
forget the work to which God has called me, for assuredly, faithful as by God’s grace you
are, you remember all the prayers2510 of the Church; how we pray also for our brethren
when on a journey and offer prayer in the holy church for those who are in the army, and
for those who speak for the sake of the Lord’s name, and for those who show the fruits of
the Spirit. In most, or all of these, I reckon your lordship to be included. How could I ever
forget you, as far as I am individually concerned, when I have so many reasons to stir me
to recollection, such a sister, such nephews, such kinsfolk, so good, so fond of me, house,
household, and friends? By all these, even against my will, I am perforce reminded of your
good disposition. As to this, however, our brother has brought me no unpleasant news, nor
has any decision been come to by me which could do him any injury. Free, then, the
chorepiscopus and myself from all blame, and grieve rather over those who have made false
reports. If our learned friend wishes to bring an action against me, he has law courts and
laws. In this I beg you not to blame me. In all the good deeds that you do, you are laying
up treasure for yourself; you are preparing for yourself in the day of retribution the same
refreshment which you are providing for those who are persecuted for the sake of the name
of the Lord. If you send the relics of the martyrs home you will do well; as you write that
the persecution there is, even now, causing martyrs to the Lord.2511</p>

<p>To the Presbyter Evagrius.2513</p>
<p>1. So far from being impatient at the length of your letter, I assure you I thought it even
short, from the pleasure it gave me when reading it. For is there anything more pleasing
than the idea of peace? Is anything more suitable to the sacred office, or more acceptable
to the Lord, than to take measures for effecting it? May you have the reward of the peacemaker,
since so blessed an office has been the object of your good desires and earnest efforts.
At the same time, believe me, my revered friend, I will yield to none in my earnest wish and
prayer to see the day when those who are one in sentiment shall all fill the same assembly.
Indeed it would be monstrous to feel pleasure in the schisms and divisions of the Churches,
and not to consider that the greatest of goods consists in the knitting together of the members
of Christ’s body. But, alas! my inability is as real as my desire. No one knows better than
yourself, that time alone is the remedy of ills that time has matured. Besides, a strong and
vigorous treatment is necessary to get at the root of the complaint. You will understand
this hint, though there is no reason why I should not speak out.</p>
<p>2. Self-importance, when rooted by habit in the mind, cannot be destroyed by one man,
by one single letter, or in a short time. Unless there be some arbiter in whom all parties
have confidence, suspicions and collisions will never altogether cease. If, indeed, the influence
of Divine grace were shed upon me, and I were given power in word and deed and spiritual
gifts to prevail with these rival parties, then this daring experiment might be demanded of
me; though, perhaps, even then, you would not advise me to attempt this adjustment of
things by myself, without the co-operation of the bishop,2514 on whom principally falls the
care of the church. But he cannot come hither, nor can I easily undertake a long journey
while the winter lasts, or rather I cannot anyhow, for the Armenian mountains will be soon
impassable, even to the young and vigorous, to say nothing of my continued bodily ailments.
I have no objection to write to tell him of all this; but I have no expectation that writing will
lead to anything, for I know his cautious character, and after all written words have little
power to convince the mind. There are so many things to urge, and to bear, and to reply
to, and to object, that a letter has no soul, and is in fact but waste paper. However, as I have
said, I will write. Only give me credit, most religious and dear brother, for having no private
feeling in the matter. Thank God. I have no such feeling towards any one. I have not busied

<head>Letter CLIX.2518</head>
<p>To Eupaterius and his daughter.2519</p>
<p>1. You may well imagine what pleasure the letter of your excellencies gave me, if only
from its very contents. What, indeed, could give greater gratification to one who prays ever
to be in communication with them who fear the Lord, and to share their blessings, than a
letter of this kind, wherein questions are asked about the knowledge of God? For if, to me,
“to live is Christ,”2520 truly my words ought to be about Christ, my every thought and deed
ought to depend upon His commandments, and my soul to be fashioned after His. I rejoice,
therefore, at being asked about such things, and congratulate the askers. By me, to speak
shortly, the faith of the Fathers assembled at Nicæa is honoured before all later inventions.
In it the Son is confessed to be con-substantial with the Father and to be naturally of the
same nature with Him who begat Him, for He was confessed to be Light of Light, God of
God, and Good of Good, and the like. Both by those holy men the same doctrine was declared,
and by me now who pray that I may walk in their footsteps.</p>
<p>2. But since the question now raised by those who are always endeavouring to introduce
novelties, but passed over in silence by the men of old, because the doctrine was never
gainsaid, has remained without full explanation (I mean that which concerns the Holy
Ghost) I will add a statement on this subject in conformity with the sense of Scripture. As
we were baptized, so we profess our belief. As we profess our belief, so also we offer praise.
As then baptism has been given us by the Saviour, in the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost, so, in accordance with our baptism, we make the confession of the
creed, and our doxology in accordance with our creed. We glorify the Holy Ghost together
with the Father and the Son, from the conviction that He is not separated from the Divine
Nature; for that which is foreign by nature does not share in the same honors. All who call
the Holy Ghost a creature we pity, on the ground that, by this utterance, they are falling into
the unpardonable sin of blasphemy against Him. I need use no argument to prove to those
who are even slightly trained in Scripture, that the creature is separated from the Godhead.
The creature is a slave; but the Spirit sets free.2521 The creature needs life; the Spirit is the
Giver of life.2522 The creature requires teaching. It is the Spirit that teaches.2523 The

creature is sanctified; it is the Spirit that sanctifies.2524 Whether you name angels, archangels,
or all the heavenly powers, they receive their sanctification through the Spirit, but the Spirit
Himself has His holiness by nature, not received by favour, but essentially His; whence He
has received the distinctive name of Holy. What then is by nature holy, as the Father is by
nature holy, and the Son by nature holy, we do not ourselves allow to be separated and
severed from the divine and blessed Trinity, nor accept those who rashly reckon it as part
of creation. Let this short summary be sufficient for you, my pious friends. From little
seeds, with the co-operation of the Holy Ghost, you will reap the fuller crop of piety. “Give
instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser.”2525 I will put off fuller demonstration
till we meet. When we do, it will be possible for me to answer objections, to give you fuller
proofs from Scripture, and to confirm all the sound rule of faith. For the present pardon
my brevity. I should not have written at all had I not thought it a greater injury to you to
refuse your request altogether than to grant it in part.</p>

<head>Letter CLX.2526</head>
<p>To Diodorus.2527</p>
<p>1. I have received the letter which has reached me under the name of Diodorus, but in
what it contains creditable to any one rather than to Diodorus. Some ingenious person
seems to have assumed your name, with the intention of getting credit with his hearers. It
appears that he was asked by some one if it was lawful to contract marriage with his deceased
wife’s sister; and, instead of shuddering at such a question, he heard it unmoved, and quite
boldly and bravely supported the unseemly desire. Had I his letter by me I would have sent
it you, and you would have been able to defend both yourself and the truth. But the person
who showed it me took it away again, and carried it about as a kind of trophy of triumph
against me who had forbidden it from the beginning, declaring that he had permission in
writing. Now I have written to you that I may attack that spurious document with double
strength, and leave it no force whereby it may injure its readers.</p>
<p>2. First of all I have to urge, what is of most importance in such matters, our own custom,
which has the force of law, because the rules have been handed down to us by holy men. It
is as follows: if any one, overcome by impurity, falls into unlawful intercourse with two
sisters, this is not to be looked upon as marriage, nor are they to be admitted at all into the
Church until they have separated from one another. Wherefore, although it were possible
to say nothing further, the custom would be quite enough to safeguard what is right. But,
since the writer of the letter has endeavoured to introduce this mischief into our practice
by a false argument, I am under the necessity of not omitting the aid of reasoning; although
in matters which are perfectly plain every man’s instinctive sentiment is stronger than argument.</p>
<p>3. It is written, he says, in Leviticus “Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex
her, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.”2528 From this it is plain,
he argues, that it is lawful to take her when the wife is dead. To this my first answer shall
be, that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law; otherwise we shall be
subject to circumcision, the sabbath, abstinence from meats. For we certainly must not,
when we find anything which falls in with our pleasures, subject ourselves to the yoke of
slavery to the law; and then, if anything in the law seems hard, have recourse to the freedom
which is in Christ. We have been asked if it is written that one may be taken to wife after
her sister. Let us say what is safe and true, that it is not written. But to deduce by sequence
of argument what is passed over in silence is the part of a legislator, not of one who quotes
<note type="footnote">2526 Placed in 373 or 374.</note>

<pb n="616"/>
the articles of the law. Indeed, on these terms, any one who likes will be at liberty to take
the sister, even in the lifetime of the wife. The same sophism fits in this case also. It is
written, he says, “Thou shalt not take a wife to vex her:” so that, apart from vexation, there
is no prohibition to take her. The man who wants to indulge his desire will maintain that
the relationship of sisters is such that they cannot vex one another. Take away the reason
given for the prohibition to live with both, and what is there to prevent a man’s taking both
sisters? This is not written, we shall say. Neither is the former distinctly stated. The deduction
from the argument allows liberty in both cases. But a solution of the difficulty might
be found by going a little back to what is behind the enactment. It appears that the legislator
does not include every kind of sin, but particularly prohibits those of the Egyptians, from
among whom Israel had gone forth, and of the Canaanites among whom they were going.
The words are as follows, “After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye
not do; and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not do:
neither shall ye walk in their ordinances.”2529 It is probable that this kind of sin was not
practised at that time among the Gentiles. Under these circumstances the lawgiver was, it
may be supposed, under no necessity of guarding against it; the unwritten custom sufficed
to condemn the crime. How then is it that while forbidding the greater he was silent about
the less? Because the example of the patriarch seemed injurious to many who indulged their
flesh so far as to live with sisters in their life time. What ought to be my course? To quote
the Scriptures, or to work out what they leave unsaid? In these laws it is not written that a
father and son ought not to have the same concubine, but, in the prophet, it is thought deserving
of the most extreme condemnation, “A man and his father” it is said “will go in
unto the same maid.”2530 And how many other forms of unclean lust have been found out
in the devils’ school, while divine scripture is silent about them, not choosing to befoul its
dignity with the names of filthy things and condemning their uncleanness in general terms!
As the apostle Paul says, “Fornication and all uncleanness…let it not be once named among
you as becometh saints,”2531 thus including the unspeakable doings of both males and females
under the name of uncleanness. It follows that silence certainly does not give license to
voluptuaries.</p>
<p>4. I, however, maintain that this point has not been left in silence, but that the lawgiver
has made a distinct prohibition. The words “None of you shall approach to any one that is
<note type="footnote">2529 Lev. xviii. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">2530 Amos ii. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">2531 Eph. v. 3.</note>

<pb n="617"/>
near of kin to him, to uncover their nakedness,”2532 embraces also this form of kinsmanship,
for what could be more akin to a man than his own wife, or rather than his own flesh? “For
they are no more twain but one flesh.”2533 So, through the wife, the sister is made akin to
the husband. For as he shall not take his wife’s mother, nor yet his wife’s daughter, because
he may not take his own mother nor his own daughter, so he may not take his wife’s sister,
because he may not take his own sister. And, on the other hand, it will not be lawful for the
wife to be joined with the husband’s kin, for the rights of relationship hold good on both
sides. But, for my part, to every one who is thinking about marriage I testify that, “the
fashion of this world passeth away,”2534 and the time is short: “it remaineth that both they
that have wives be as though they had none.”2535 If he improperly quotes the charge “Increase
and multiply,”2536 I laugh at him, for not discerning the signs of the times. Second
marriage is a remedy against fornication, not a means of lasciviousness. “If they cannot
contain,” it is said “let them marry;”2537 but if they marry they must not break the law.</p>
<p>5. But they whose souls are blinded by dishonourable lust do not regard even nature,
which from old time distinguished the names of the family. For under what relationship
will those who contract these unions name their sons? Will they call them brothers or
cousins of one another? For, on account of the confusion, both names will apply. O man,
do not make the aunt the little one’s stepmother; do not arm with implacable jealousy her
who ought to cherish them with a mother’s love. It is only stepmothers who extend their
hatred even beyond death; other enemies make a truce with the dead; stepmothers begin
their hatred after death.2538 The sum of what I say is this. If any one wants to contract a
lawful marriage, the whole world is open to him: if he is only impelled by lust, let him be
the more restricted, “that he may know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour,
not in the lust of concupiscence.”2539 I should like to say more, but the limits of my letter
leave me no further room. I pray that my exhortation may prove stronger than lust, or at

believers in Christ are one people; all Christ’s people, although He is hailed from many regions,
are one Church; and so our country is glad and rejoices at the dispensation of the
Lord, and instead of thinking that she is one man the poorer, considers that through one
man she has become possessed of whole Churches. Only may the Lord grant me both to
see you in person, and, so long as I am parted from you, to hear of your progress in the
gospel, and of the good order of your Churches.</p>

has entrusted to your hand. Like a skilful pilot, rise in mind above every wave lifted by
heretical blasts; keep the boat from being whelmed by the salt and bitter billows of false
doctrine; and wait for the calm to be made by the Lord so soon as there shall have been
found a voice worthy of rousing Him to rebuke the winds and the sea. If you wish to visit
me, now hurried by long sickness towards the inevitable end, do not wait for an opportunity,
or for the word from me. You know that to a father’s heart every time is suitable to embrace
a well-loved son, and that affection is stronger than words. Do not lament over a responsibility
transcending your strength. If you had been destined to bear the burden unaided, it
would have been not merely heavy; it would have been intolerable. But if the Lord shares
the load with you, “cast all your care upon the Lord”2543 and He will Himself act. Only be
exhorted ever to give heed lest you be carried away by wicked customs. Rather change all

<p>To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.2545</p>
<p>The same cause seems to make me hesitate to write, and to prove that I must write.
When I think of the visit which I owe, and reckon up the gain at meeting you, I cannot help
despising letters, as being not even shadows in comparison with the reality. Then, again,
when I reckon that my only consolation, deprived as I am of all that is best and most important,
is to salute such a man and beg him, as I am wont, not to forget me in his prayers, I
bethink me that letters are of no small value. I do not, myself, wish to give up all hope of
my visit, nor to despair of seeing you. I should be ashamed not to seem to put so much
confidence in your prayers as even to expect to be turned from an old man into a young
one, if such a need were to arise, and not merely from a sick and emaciated one, as I am
now, into one a little bit stronger. It is not easy to express in words the reason of my not
being with you already, because I am not only prevented by actual illness, but have not even
force of speech enough at any time to give you an account of such manifold and complex
disease. I can only say that, ever since Easter up to now, fever, diarrhoea, and intestinal
disturbance, drowning me like waves, do not suffer me to lift my head above them. Brother
Barachus may be able to tell you the character of my symptoms, if not as their severity deserves,
at least clearly enough to make you understand the reason of my delay. If you join
cordially in my prayers, I have no doubt that my troubles will easily pass away.</p>

your words exactly characterized your steadfastness, your real dignity, your unfailing sincerity;
in all those things it comforted me greatly though I could not see you. Never fail, then,
to seize every opportunity of writing to me, and to give me the pleasure of conversing with
you at a distance; for to see you face to face I am now forbidden by the distressing state of
my health. How serious this is you will learn from the God-beloved bishop Amphilochius,
who is both able to report to you from his having been constantly with me, and fully competent
to tell you what he has seen. But the only reason why I wish you to know of my sufferings
is, that you will forgive me for the future, and acquit me of lack of energy, if I fail to
come and see you, though in truth my loss does not so much need defence from me as
comfort from you. Had it been possible for me to come to you, I should have very much

<head>Letter CLXIV.2547</head>
<p>To Ascholius.2548</p>
<p>1. It would not be easy for me to say how very much delighted I am with your holiness’s
letter. My words are too weak to express all that I feel; you, however, ought to be able to
conjecture it, from the beauty of what you have written. For what did not your letter contain?
It contained love to God; the marvellous description of the martyrs, which put the manner
of their good fight so plainly before me that I seemed actually to see it; love and kindness
to myself; words of surpassing beauty. So when I had taken it into my hands, and read it
many times, and perceived how abundantly full it was of the grace of the Spirit, I thought
that I had gone back to the good old times, when God’s Churches flourished, rooted in faith,
united in love, all the members being in harmony, as though in one body. Then the persecutors
were manifest, and manifest too the persecuted. Then the people grew more numerous
by being attacked. Then the blood of the martyrs, watering the Churches, nourished many
more champions of true religion, each generation stripping for the struggle with the zeal of
those that had gone before. Then we Christians were in peace with one another, the peace
which the Lord bequeathed us, of which, so cruelly have we driven it from among us, not a
single trace is now left us. Yet my soul did go back to that blessedness of old, when a letter
came from a long distance, bright with the beauty of love, and a martyr travelled to me from
wild regions beyond the Danube, preaching in his own person the exactitude of the faith
which is there observed. Who could tell the delight of my soul at all this? What power of
speech could be devised competent to describe all that I felt in the bottom of my heart?
However, when I saw the athlete, I blessed his trainer: he, too, before the just Judge, after
strengthening many for the conflict on behalf of true religion, shall receive the crown of
righteousness.</p>
<p>2. By bringing the blessed Eutyches2549 to my recollection, and honouring my country
for having sown the seeds of true religion, you have at once delighted me by your reminder
of the past, and distressed me by your conviction of the present. None of us now comes
near Eutyches in goodness: so far are we from bringing barbarians under the softening
power of the Spirit, and the operation of His graces, that by the greatness of our sins we turn
gentle hearted men into barbarians, for to ourselves and to our sins I attribute it that the
influence of the heretics is so widely diffused. Peradventure no part of the world has escaped

the conflagration of heresy. You tell me of struggles of athletes, bodies lacerated for the
truth’s sake, savage fury despised by men of fearless heart, various tortures of persecutors,
and constancy of the wrestlers through them all, the block and the water whereby the martyrs
died.2550 And what is our condition? Love is grown cold; the teaching of the Fathers is
being laid waste; everywhere is shipwreck of the Faith; the mouths of the Faithful are silent;
the people, driven from the houses of prayer, lift up their hands in the open air to their Lord
which is in heaven. Our afflictions are heavy, martyrdom is nowhere to be seen, because
those who evilly entreat us are called by the same name as ourselves. Wherefore pray to the
Lord yourself, and join all Christ’s noble athletes with you in prayer for the Churches, to
the end that, if any further time remains for this world, and all things are not being driven
to destruction, God may be reconciled to his own Churches and restore them to their ancient
peace.</p>

glorifying God; then they flung him down, and put a block about his neck, and plunged him into the depth. So
slain by wood and water, he kept the symbol of salvation undefiled, being 38 years old.” cf. Ruinart., Act. Sinc.

<p>To Ascholius, bishop of Thessalonica.2552</p>
<p>God has fulfilled my old prayer in deigning to allow me to receive the letter of your
veritable holiness. What I most of all desire is to see you and to be seen by you, and to enjoy
in actual intercourse all the graces of the Spirit with which you are endowed. This, however,
is impossible, both on account of the distance which separates us, and the engrossing occupations
of each of us. I therefore pray, in the second place, that my soul may be fed by frequent
letters from your love in Christ. This has now been granted me on taking your epistle
into my hands. I have been doubly delighted at the enjoyment of your communication. I
felt as though I could really see your very soul shining in your words as in some mirror; and
I was moved to exceeding joy, not only at your proving to be what all testimony says of you,
but that your noble qualities are the ornament of my country. You have filled the country
beyond our borders with spiritual fruits, like some vigorous branch sprung from a glorious
root. Rightly, then, does our country rejoice in her own offshoots. When you were engaging
in conflicts for the Faith she heard that the goodly heritage of the Fathers was preserved in
you, and she glorified God. And now what are you about? You have honoured the land
that gave you birth by sending her a martyr who has just fought a good fight in the barbarian
country on your borders, just as a grateful gardener might send his first fruits to those who
had given him the seeds. Verily the gift is worthy of Christ’s athlete, a martyr of the truth
just crowned with the crown of righteousness, whom we have gladly welcomed, glorifying
God who has now fulfilled the gospel of His Christ in all the world. Let me ask you to remember
in your prayers me who love you, and for my soul’s sake earnestly to beseech the
Lord that one day I, too, may be deemed worthy to begin to serve God, according to the
way of His commandments which He has given us to salvation.</p>

<p>Basil to Gregory.2560</p>
<p>You have undertaken a kindly and charitable task in getting together the captive troop
of the insolent Glycerius (at present I must so write), and, so far as in you lay, covering our
common shame. It is only right that your reverence should undo this dishonour with a full
knowledge of the facts about him.</p>
<p>This grave and venerable Glycerius of yours was ordained by me deacon of the church
of Venesa2561 to serve the presbyter, and look after the work of the Church, for, though the
fellow is in other respects intractable, he is naturally clever at manual labour. No sooner
was he appointed than he neglected his work, as though there had been absolutely nothing
to do. But, of his own private power and authority, he got together some wretched virgins,
some of whom came to him of their own accord (you know how young people are prone
to anything of this kind), and others were unwillingly forced to accept him as leader of their
company. Then he assumed the style and title of patriarch, and began all of a sudden to
play the man of dignity. He had not attained to this on any reasonable or pious ground; his
only object was to get a means of livelihood, just as some men start one trade and some another.
He has all but upset the whole Church, scorning his own presbyter, a man venerable
both by character and age; scorning his chorepiscopus, and myself, as of no account at all,
continually filling the town and all the clergy with disorder and disturbance. And now, on
being mildly rebuked by me and his chorepiscopus, that he may not treat us with contempt
(for he was trying to stir the younger men to like insubordination), he is meditating conduct
most audacious and inhuman. After robbing as many of the virgins as he could, he has
made off by night. I am sure all this will have seemed very sad to you. Think of the time
too. The feast was being held there, and, as was natural, large numbers of people were
gathered together. He, however, on his side, brought out his own troop, who followed young
men and danced round them, causing all well-disposed persons to be most distressed, while
loose chatterers laughed aloud. And even this was not enough, enormous as was the scandal.
I am told that even the parents of the virgins, finding their bereavement unendurable,
wishful to bring home the scattered company, and falling with not unnatural sighs and tears
at their daughters’ feet, have been insulted and outraged by this excellent young man and

of it attaches to us all alike. First of all, order him to come back with the virgins. He might
find some mercy, if he were to come back with a letter from you. If you do not adopt this
course, at least send the virgins back to their mother the Church. If this cannot be done, at
all events do not allow any violence to be done to those that are willing to return, but get
them to return to me. Otherwise I call God and man to witness that all this is ill done, and
a breach of the law of the Church. The best course would be for Glycerius to come back
with a letter,2562 and in a becoming and proper frame of mind; if not, let him be deprived
of his ministry.2563</p>

<p>There is no need for me to say how much I was delighted by your letter. Your own
words will enable you to conjecture what I felt on receiving it. You have exhibited to me in
your letter, the first fruits of the Spirit, love. Than this what can be more precious to me in
the present state of affairs, when, because iniquity abounds, the love of many has waxed
cold?2570 Nothing is rarer now than spiritual intercourse with a brother, a word of peace,
and such spiritual communion as I have found in you. For this I thank the Lord, beseeching
Him that I may have part in the perfect joy that is found in you. If such be your letter, what
must it be to meet you in person? If when you are far away you so affect me, what will you
be to me when you are seen face to face? Be sure that if I had not been detained by innumerable
occupations, and all the unavoidable anxieties which tie me down, I should have hurried
to see your excellency. Although that old complaint of mine is a great hindrance to my
moving about, nevertheless in view of the good I expect, I would not have allowed this to
stand in my way. To be permitted to meet a man holding the same views and reverencing
the faith of the Fathers, as you are said to do by our honourable brethren and fellow presbyters,
is in truth to go back to the ancient blessedness of the Churches, when the sufferers
from unsound disputation were few, and all lived in peace, “workmen” obeying the commandments
and not “needing to be ashamed,”2571 serving the Lord with simple and clear
confession, and keeping plain and inviolate their faith in Father, Son and Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>To Theodora the Canoness.2573</p>
<p>I should be more diligent in writing to you but for my belief that my letters do not always,
my friend, reach your own hands. I am afraid that through the naughtiness of those on
whose service I depend, especially at a time like this when the whole world is in a state of
confusion, a great many other people get hold of them. So I wait to be found fault with, and
to be eagerly asked for my letters, that so I may have this proof of their delivery. Yet,
whether I write or not, one thing I do without failing, and that is to keep in my heart the
memory of your excellency, and to pray the Lord to grant that you may complete the course
of good living which you have chosen. For in truth it is no light thing for one, who makes
a profession, to follow up all that the promise entails. Any one may embrace the gospel life,
but only a very few of those who have come within my knowledge have completely carried
out their duty in its minutest details, and have overlooked nothing that is contained therein.
Only a very few have been consistent in keeping the tongue in check and the eye under
guidance, as the Gospel would have it; in working with the hands according to the mark of
doing what is pleasing to God; in moving the feet, and using every member, as the Creator
ordained from the beginning. Propriety in dress, watchfulness in the society of men, moderation
in eating and drinking, the avoidance of superfluity in the acquisition of necessities;
all these things seem small enough when they are thus merely mentioned, but, as I have
found by experience, their consistent observance requires no light struggle. Further, such
a perfection of humility as not even to remember nobility of family, nor to be elevated by
any natural advantage of body or mind which we may have, nor to allow other people’s
opinion of us to be a ground of pride and exaltation, all this belongs to the evangelic life.
There is also sustained self-control, industry in prayer, sympathy in brotherly love, generosity
to the poor, lowliness of temper, contrition of heart, soundness of faith, calmness in depression,
while we never forget the terrible and inevitable tribunal. To that judgment we are all
hastening, but those who remember it, and are anxious about what is to follow after it, are
very few.</p>

yourself, and very good it is of you to do so, sending me needful information about all that
is in your mind, I am stirred to write back to you. Let me then set right what has been
omitted in the past, and at the same time reply to what your excellency has written. Truly
blessed is the soul, which by night and by day has no other anxiety than how, when the great
day comes wherein all creation shall stand before the Judge and shall give an account for its
deeds, she too may be able easily to get quit of the reckoning of life.</p>
<p>For he who keeps that day and that hour ever before him, and is ever meditating upon
the defence to be made before the tribunal where no excuses will avail, will sin not at all, or
not seriously, for we begin to sin when there is a lack of the fear of God in us. When men
have a clear apprehension of what is threatened them, the awe inherent in them will never
allow them to fall into inconsiderate action or thought. Be mindful therefore of God. Keep
the fear of Him in your heart, and enlist all men to join with you in your prayers, for great
is the aid of them that are able to move God by their importunity. Never cease to do this.
Even while we are living this life in the flesh, prayer will be a mighty helper to us, and when
we are departing hence it will be a sufficient provision for us on the journey to the world to
come.2575</p>
<p>Anxiety is a good thing; but, on the other hand, despondency, dejection, and despair
of our salvation, are injurious to the soul. Trust therefore in the goodness of God, and look
for His succour, knowing that if we turn to Him rightly and sincerely, not only will He not
cast us off forever, but will say to us, even while we are in the act of uttering the words of
our prayer, “Lo! I am with you.”</p>

<p>To Count Magnenianus.2577</p>
<p>Your excellency lately wrote to me, plainly charging me, besides other matters, to write
concerning the Faith. I admire your zeal in the matter, and I pray God that your choice of
good things may be persistent, and that, advancing in knowledge and good works, you may
be made perfect. But I have no wish to leave behind me a treatise on the Faith, or to write
various creeds, and so I have declined to send what you asked.2578 You seem to me to be
surrounded by the din of your men there, idle fellows, who say certain things to calumniate
me, with the idea that they will improve their own position by lying disgracefully against
me.2579 The past shews what they are, and future experience will shew them in still plainer
colours. I, however, call on all who trust in Christ not to busy themselves in opposition to
the ancient faith, but, as we believe, so to be baptized, and, as we are baptized, so to offer
the doxology.2580 It is enough for us to confess those names which we have received from
Holy Scripture, and to shun all innovation about them. Our salvation does not lie in the
invention of modes of address, but in the sound confession of the Godhead in which we
have professed our faith.</p>

held by disorderly presbyters or bishops or by uninstructed laymen. As, for instance, if a
man be convicted of crime, and prohibited from discharging ministerial functions, and then
refuses to submit to the canons, but arrogates to himself episcopal and ministerial rights,

receive them on their repentance, into the same rank. Now the Pepuzeni are plainly
heretical, for, by unlawfully and shamefully applying to Montanus and Priscilla the title of
the Paraclete, they have blasphemed against the Holy Ghost. They are, therefore, to be
condemned for ascribing divinity to men; and for outraging the Holy Ghost by comparing
Him to men. They are thus also liable to eternal damnation, inasmuch as blasphemy against
the Holy Ghost admits of no forgiveness. What ground is there, then, for the acceptance
of the baptism of men who baptize into the Father and the Son and Montanus or Priscilla?
For those who have not been baptized into the names delivered to us have not been baptized
at all. So that, although this escaped the vigilance of the great Dionysius, we must by no
means imitate his error. The absurdity of the position is obvious in a moment, and evident

Cyprian and our own2621 Firmilianus, to reject all these, Cathari, Encratites,2622 and Hydroparastatæ,
2623 by one common condemnation, because the origin of separation arose through
schism, and those who had apostatized from the Church had no longer on them the grace
of the Holy Spirit, for it ceased to be imparted when the continuity was broken. The first
separatists had received their ordination from the Fathers, and possessed the spiritual gift
by the laying on of their hands. But they who were broken off had become laymen, and,
because they are no longer able to confer on others that grace of the Holy Spirit from which
they themselves are fallen away, they had no authority either to baptize or to ordain. And
therefore those who were from time to time baptized by them, were ordered, as though
baptized by laymen, to come to the church to be purified by the Church’s true baptism.
Nevertheless, since it has seemed to some of those of Asia that, for the sake of management
of the majority, their baptism should be accepted, let it be accepted. We must, however,
perceive the iniquitous action of the Encratites; who, in order to shut themselves out from
being received back by the Church have endeavoured for the future to anticipate readmission
by a peculiar baptism of their own, violating, in this manner even their own special prac-
tice.2624 My opinion, therefore, is that nothing being distinctly laid down concerning them,
it is our duty to reject their baptism, and that in the case of any one who has received baptism
from them, we should, on his coming to the church, baptize him. If, however, there is any

likelihood of this being detrimental to general discipline, we must fall back upon custom,
and follow the fathers who have ordered what course we are to pursue. For I am under
some apprehension lest, in our wish to discourage them from baptizing, we may, through
the severity of our decision, be a hindrance to those who are being saved. If they accept our
baptism, do not allow this to distress us. We are by no means bound to return them the
same favour, but only strictly to obey canons. On every ground let it be enjoined that those
who come to us from their baptism be anointed2625 in the presence of the faithful, and only
on these terms approach the mysteries. I am aware that I have received into episcopal rank
Izois and Saturninus from the Encratite following.2626 I am precluded therefore from separating
from the Church those who have been united to their company, inasmuch as, through
my acceptance of the bishops, I have promulgated a kind of canon of communion with
them.</p>

punishment, however, of these women should not be for life, but for the term of ten years.
And let their treatment depend not on mere lapse of time, but on the character of their repentance.</p>
<p>III. A deacon who commits fornication after his appointment to the diaconate is to be
deposed. But, after he has been rejected and ranked among the laity, he is not to be excluded
from communion. For there is an ancient canon that those who have fallen from their degree
are to be subjected to this kind of punishment alone.2627</p>
<p>Herein, as I suppose, the ancient authorities followed the old rule “Thou shalt not avenge
twice for the same thing.”2628 There is this further reason too, that laymen, when expelled
from the place of the faithful, are from time to time restored to the rank whence they have
fallen; but the deacon undergoes once for all the lasting penalty of deposition. His deacon’s
orders not being restored to him, they rested at this one punishment. So far is this as regards
what depends on law laid down. But generally a truer remedy is the departure from sin.
Wherefore that man will give me full proof of his cure who, after rejecting grace for the sake
of the indulgence of the flesh, has then, through bruising of the flesh2629 and the enslaving
of it2630 by means of self control, abandoned the pleasures whereby he was subdued. We
ought therefore to know both what is of exact prescription and what is of custom; and, in
cases which do not admit of the highest treatment, to follow the traditional direction.</p>
<p>IV. In the case of trigamy and polygamy they laid down the same rule, in proportion,
as in the case of digamy; namely one year for digamy (some authorities say two years); for
trigamy men are separated for three and often for four years; but this is no longer described
as marriage at all, but as polygamy; nay rather as limited fornication. It is for this reason
that the Lord said to the woman of Samaria, who had five husbands, “he whom thou now
hast is not thy husband.”2631 He does not reckon those who had exceeded the limits of a
second marriage as worthy of the title of husband or wife. In cases of trigamy we have accepted
a seclusion of five years, not by the canons, but following the precept of our predecessors.
Such offenders ought not to be altogether prohibited from the privileges of the

indiscriminately, but on trial of exhibition of true repentance and of producing fruit in
evidence of their zeal for salvation.2632</p>
<p>VI. The fornication of canonical persons is not to be reckoned as wedlock, and their
union is to be completely dissolved, for this is both profitable for the security of the Church
and will prevent the heretics from having a ground of attack against us, as though we induced
men to join us by the attraction of liberty to sin.</p>
<p>VII. Abusers of themselves with mankind, and with beasts, as also murderers, wizards,
adulterers, and idolaters, are deserving of the same punishment. Whatever rule you have
in the case of the rest, observe also in their case. There can, however, be no doubt that we
ought to receive those who have repented of impurity committed in ignorance for thirty
years.2633 In this case there is ground for forgiveness in ignorance, in the spontaneity of
confession, and the long extent of time. Perhaps they have been delivered to Satan for a
whole age of man that they may learn not to behave unseemly;2634 wherefore order them
to be received without delay, specially if they shed tears to move your mercy, and shew a
manner of living worthy of compassion.2635</p>

<p>VIII. The man who in a rage has taken up a hatchet against his own wife is a murderer.
But it is what I should have expected from your intelligence that you should very properly
remind me to speak on these points more fully, because a wide distinction must be drawn
between cases where there is and where there is not intent. A case of an act purely unintentional,
and widely removed from the purpose of the agent, is that of a man who throws a
stone at a dog or a tree, and hits a man. The object was to drive off the beast or to shake
down the fruit. The chance comer falls fortuitously in the way of the blow, and the act is
unintentional. Unintentional too is the act of any one who strikes another with a strap or
a flexible stick, for the purpose of chastising him, and the man who is being beaten dies. In
this case it must be taken into consideration that the object was not to kill, but to improve,
the offender. Further, among unintentional acts must be reckoned the case of a man in a
fight who when warding off an enemy’s attack with cudgel or hand, hits him without mercy
in some vital part, so as to injure him, though not quite to kill him. This, however, comes
very near to the intentional; for the man who employs such a weapon in self defence, or
who strikes without mercy, evidently does not spare his opponent, because he is mastered
by passion. In like manner the case of any one who uses a heavy cudgel, or a stone too big
for a man to stand, is reckoned among the unintentional, because he does not do what he
meant: in his rage he deals such a blow as to kill his victim, yet all he had in his mind was
to give him a thrashing, not to do him to death. If, however, a man uses a sword, or anything
of the kind, he has no excuse: certainly none if he throws his hatchet. For he does not strike
with the hand, so that the force of the blow may be within his own control, but throws, so
that from the weight and edge of the iron, and the force of the throw, the wound cannot fail
to be fatal.</p>
<p>On the other hand acts done in the attacks of war or robbery are distinctly intentional,
and admit of no doubt. Robbers kill for greed, and to avoid conviction. Soldiers who inflict
death in war do so with the obvious purpose not of fighting, nor chastising, but of killing
their opponents. And if any one has concocted some magic philtre for some other reason,
and then causes death, I count this as intentional. Women frequently endeavour to draw
men to love them by incantations and magic knots, and give them drugs which dull their
<note type="footnote">tamen non ita pridem amicos habuerat; ac anno 568, Musonii morte affictos litteris amicissimis consolatus fuerat.

intelligence. Such women, when they cause death, though the result of their action may not
be what they intended, are nevertheless, on account of their proceedings being magical and
prohibited, to be reckoned among intentional homicides. Women also who administer
drugs to cause abortion, as well as those who take poisons to destroy unborn children, are
murderesses. So much on this subject.</p>
<p>IX. The sentence of the Lord that it is unlawful to withdraw from wedlock, save on account
of fornication,2636 applies, according to the argument, to men and women alike.
Custom, however, does not so obtain. Yet, in relation with women, very strict expressions
are to be found; as, for instance, the words of the apostle “He which is joined to a harlot is
one body”2637 and of Jeremiah, If a wife “become another man’s shall he return unto her
again? shall not that land be greatly polluted?”2638 And again, “He that hath an adulteress
is a fool and impious.”2639 Yet custom ordains that men who commit adultery and are in
fornication be retained by their wives. Consequently I do not know if the woman who lives
with the man who has been dismissed can properly be called an adulteress; the charge in
this case attaches to the woman who has put away her husband, and depends upon the cause
for which she withdrew from wedlock.2640 In the case of her being beaten, and refusing to
submit, it would be better for her to endure than to be separated from her husband; in the
case of her objecting to pecuniary loss, even here she would not have sufficient ground. If
her reason is his living in fornication we do not find this in the custom of the church; but
from an unbelieving husband a wife is commanded not to depart, but to remain, on account
of the uncertainty of the issue. “For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save
thy husband?”2641 Here then the wife, if she leaves her husband and goes to another, is an
adulteress. But the man who has been abandoned is pardonable, and the woman who lives
with such a man is not condemned. But if the man who has deserted his wife goes to another,

<p>X. Those who swear that they will not receive ordination, declining orders upon oath,
must not be driven to perjure themselves, although there does seem to be a canon making
concessions to such persons. Yet I have found by experience that perjurers never turn out
well.2642 Account must however be taken of the form of the oath, its terms, the frame of
mind in which it was taken, and the minutest additions made to the terms, since, if no
ground of relief can anywhere be found, such persons must be dismissed. The case, however,
of Severus, I mean of the presbyter ordained by him, does seem to me to allow of relief of
this kind, if you will permit it. Give directions for the district placed under Mestia, to which
the man was appointed, to be reckoned under Vasoda. Thus he will not forswear himself
by not departing from the place, and Longinus, having Cyriacus with him, will not leave
the Church unprovided for, nor himself be guilty of neglect of work.2643 I moreover shall
not be held guilty of taking action in contravention of any canons by making a concession
to Cyriacus who had sworn that he would remain at Mindana and yet accepted the transfer.
His return will be in accordance with his oath, and his obedience to the arrangement will
not be reckoned against him as perjury, because it was not added to his oath that he would
not go, even a short time, from Mindana, but would remain there for the future. Severus,
who pleads forgetfulness, I shall pardon, only telling him that One who knows what is secret
will not overlook the ravaging of His Church by a man of such a character; a man who originally
appoints uncanonically, then imposes oaths in violation of the Gospel, then tells a

in eleven years. We shall, without doubt, observe what is laid down by Moses in the case

who lies down after he has been struck, and walks again leaning on his staff.2644 If, however,
he does not rise again after he has been struck, nevertheless, from there being no intent to
kill, the striker is a homicide, but an unintentional homicide.</p>

<p>XV. I am astonished at your requiring exactitude in Scripture, and arguing that there
is something forced in the diction of the interpretation which gives the meaning of the original,
but does not exactly render what is meant by the Hebrew word. Yet I must not carelessly
pass by the question started by an enquiring mind. At the creation of the world, birds
of the air and the fishes of the sea had the same origin;2648 for both kinds were produced
from the water.2649 The reason is that both have the same characteristics. The latter swim
in the water, the former in the air. They are therefore mentioned together. The form of
expression is not used without distinction, but of all that lives in the water it is used very
properly. The birds of the air and the fishes of the sea are subject to man; and not they
alone, but all that passes through the paths of the sea. For every water-creature is not a fish,
as for instance the sea monsters, whales, sharks, dolphins, seals, even sea-horses, sea-dogs,
saw-fish, sword-fish, and sea-cows; and, if you like, sea nettles, cockles and all hard-shelled
creatures of whom none are fish, and all pass through the paths of the sea; so that there are
three kinds, birds of the air, fishes of the sea, and all water-creatures which are distinct from
fish, and pass through the paths of the sea.</p>

<p>To Eustathius the physician.2652</p>
<p>Humanity is the regular business of all you who practise as physicians. And, in my
opinion, to put your science at the head and front of life’s pursuits is to decide reasonably
and rightly. This at all events seems to be the case if man’s most precious possession, life,
is painful and not worth living, unless it be lived in health, and if for health we are dependent
on your skill. In your own case medicine is seen, as it were, with two right hands; you enlarge
the accepted limits of philanthropy by not confining the application of your skill to men’s
bodies, but by attending also to the cure of the diseases of their souls. It is not only in ac-

which I have had on many occasions and to a remarkable degree at the present time, in the
midst of the unspeakable wickedness of our enemies, which has flooded our life like a noxious
torrent. You have most skilfully dispersed it and by pouring in your soothing words have
allayed the inflammation of my heart. Having regard to the successive and diversified attacks
of my enemies against me, I thought that I ought to keep silence and to bear their successive
assaults without reply, and without attempting to contradict foes armed with a lie, that terrible
weapon which too often drives its point through the heart of truth herself. You did well in
urging me not to abandon the defence of truth, but rather to convict our calumniators, lest
haply, by the success of lies, many be hurt.</p>
<p>2. In adopting an unexpected attitude of hatred against me my opponents seem to be
repeating the old story in Æsop. He makes the wolf bring certain charges against the lamb,
as being really ashamed to seem to kill a creature who had done him no harm without some
reasonable pretext; then when the lamb easily rebuts the slander, the wolf, none the less,
continues his attack, and, though defeated in equity, comes off winner in biting. Just so
with those who seem to count hatred to me as a virtue. They will perhaps blush to hate me
without a cause, and so invent pleas and charges against me, without abiding by any of their
allegations, but urging as the ground of their detestation now this, now that, and now
something else. In no single case is their malice consistent; but when they are baulked in
one charge they cling to another and, foiled in this, have recourse to a third; and if all their
accusations are scattered they do not drop their ill-will. They say that I preach three Gods,
dinning the charge into the ears of the mob and pressing the calumny plausibly and persistently.
Nevertheless, truth is fighting on my side; and both in public to all the world, and in
private to all whom I meet, I prove that I anathematize every one who maintains three Gods

and do not even allow him to be a Christian. No sooner do they hear this than Sabellius is
handy for them to urge against me, and it is noised abroad that my teaching is tainted with
his error. Once more I hold out in my defence my wonted weapon of truth, and demonstrate
that I shudder at Sabellianism as much as at Judaism.</p>
<p>3. What then? After all these efforts were they tired? Did they leave off? Not at all.
They are charging me with innovation, and base their charge on my confession of three
hypostases, and blame me for asserting one Goodness, one Power, one Godhead. In this
they are not wide of the truth, for I do so assert. Their complaint is that their custom does
not accept this, and that Scripture does not agree. What is my reply? I do not consider it
fair that the custom which obtains among them should be regarded as a law and rule of orthodoxy.
If custom is to be taken in proof of what is right, then it is certainly competent
for me to put forward on my side the custom which obtains here. If they reject this, we are
clearly not bound to follow them. Therefore let God-inspired Scripture decide between us;
and on whichever side be found doctrines in harmony with the word of God, in favour of
that side will be cast the vote of truth. What then is the charge? Two points are advanced
at one and the same time in the accusations levelled against me. I am accused on the one
hand of parting the hypostases asunder; on the other of never using in the plural any one
of the nouns relating to the Divinity, but of always speaking in the singular number of one
Goodness, as I have already said; of one Power; one Godhead; and so on. As to the parting
of the hypostases, there ought to be no objection nor opposition on the part of those who
assert in the case of the divine nature a distinction of essences. For it is unreasonable to
maintain three essences and to object to three hypostases. Nothing, then, is left but the
charge of using words of the divine nature in the singulars.</p>
<p>4. I have quite a little difficulty in meeting the second charge. Whoever condemns
those who assert that the Godhead is one, must of necessity agree with all who maintain
many godheads, or with those who maintain that there is none. No third position is conceivable.
The teaching of inspired Scripture does not allow of our speaking of many godheads,
but, wherever it mentions the Godhead, speaks of it in the singular number; as, for instance,
“in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.”2653 And again; “for the invisible
things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things
that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead.”2654 If, then, to multiply godheads is
the special mark of the victims of polytheistic error, and to deny the Godhead altogether is
<note type="footnote">2653 Col. ii. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">2654 Rom. i. 20.</note>

<pb n="662"/>
to fall into atheism, what sense is there in this charge against me of confessing one Godhead?
But they make a plainer disclosure of the end they have in view; namely, in the case of the
Father to agree that He is God, and consenting in like manner that the Son be honoured
with the attribute of Godhead; but to refuse to comprehend the Spirit, though reckoned
with Father and with Son in the idea of Godhead. They allow that the power of the Godhead
extends from the Father to the Son, but they divide the nature of the Spirit from the divine
glory. Against this view, to the best of my ability, I must enter a brief defence of my own
position.</p>
<p>5. What, then, is my argument? In delivering the Faith of Salvation to those who are
being made disciples in His doctrine, the Lord conjoins with Father and with Son the Holy
Spirit also. That which is conjoined once I maintain to be conjoined everywhere and always.
There is no question here of a ranking together in one respect and isolation in others. In
the quickening power whereby our nature is transformed from the life of corruption to
immortality, the power of the Spirit is comprehended with Father and with Son, and in
many other instances, as in the conception of the good, the holy, the eternal, the wise, the
right, the supreme, the efficient, and generally in all terms which have the higher meaning,
He is inseparably united. Wherefrom I judge it right to hold that the Spirit, thus conjoined
with Father and Son in so many sublime and divine senses, is never separated. Indeed I am
unaware of any degrees of better or worse in the terms concerning the divine nature, nor
can I imagine its being reverent and right to allow the Spirit a participation in those of
lesser dignity, while He is judged unworthy of the higher. For all conceptions and terms
which regard the divine are of equal dignity one with another, in that they do not vary in
regard to the meaning of the subject matter to which they are applied. Our thought is not
led to one subject by the attribution of good, and to another by that of wise, powerful, and
just; mention any attributes you will, the thing signified is one and the same. And if you
name God, you mean the same Being whom you understood by the rest of the terms.
Granting, then, that all the terms applied to the divine nature are of equal force one with
another in relation to that which they describe, one emphasizing one point and another
another, but all bringing our intelligence to the contemplation of the same object; what
ground is there for conceding to the Spirit fellowship with Father and Son in all other terms,
and isolating Him from the Godhead alone? There is no escape from the position that we
must either allow the fellowship here, or refuse it everywhere. If He is worthy in every
other respect, He is certainly not unworthy in this. If, as our opponents argue, He is too
insignificant to be allowed fellowship with Father and with Son in Godhead, He is not worthy
to share any single one of the divine attributes: for when the terms are carefully considered,
and compared with one another, by the help of the special meaning contemplated in each,
they will be found to involve nothing less than the title of God. A proof of what I say lies
in the fact that even many inferior objects are designated by this name. Nay, Holy Scripture

<pb n="663"/>
does not even shrink from using this term in the case of things of a totally opposite character,
as when it applies the title god to idols. “Let the gods,” it is written, “who have not made
heaven and earth, be taken away, and cast beneath the earth;”2655 and again, “the gods of
the nations are idols.”2656 And the witch, when she called up the required spirits for Saul,
is said to have seen gods.2657 Balaam too, an augur and seer, with the oracles in his hand,
as Scripture says, when he had got him the teaching of the demons by his divine ingenuity,
is described by Scripture as taking counsel with God.2658 From many similar instances in
Holy Scripture it may be proved that the name of God has no pre-eminence over other
words which are applied to the divine, since, as has been said, we find it employed without
distinction even in the case of things of quite opposite character. On the other hand we are
taught by Scripture that the names holy, incorruptible, righteous, and good, are nowhere
indiscriminately used of unworthy objects. It follows, then, that if they do not deny that
the Holy Spirit is associated with the Son and with the Father, in the names which are specially
applied, by the usage of true religion, to the divine nature alone, there is no reasonable
ground for refusing to allow the same association in the case of that word alone which, as
I have shown, is used as a recognised homonym even of demons and idols.</p>
<p>6. But they contend that this title sets forth the nature of that to which it is applied; that
the nature of the Spirit is not a nature shared in common with that of Father and of Son;
and that, for this reason, the Spirit ought not to be allowed the common use of the name.
It is, therefore, for them to show by what means they have perceived this variation in the
nature. If it were indeed possible for the divine nature to be contemplated in itself; could
what is proper to it and what is foreign to it be discovered by means of visible things; we
should then certainly stand in no need of words or other tokens to lead us to the apprehension
of the object of the enquiry. But the divine nature is too exalted to be perceived as objects
of enquiry are perceived, and about things which are beyond our knowledge we reason on
probable evidence. We are therefore of necessity guided in the investigation of the divine
nature by its operations. Suppose we observe the operations of the Father, of the Son, of
the Holy Ghost, to be different from one another, we shall then conjecture, from the diversity
of the operations that the operating natures are also different. For it is impossible that things
which are distinct, as regards their nature, should be associated as regards the form of their
operations; fire does not freeze; ice does not warm; difference of natures implies difference
of the operations proceeding from them. Grant, then, that we perceive the operation of
<note type="footnote">2655 Jer. x. 11, LXX.</note>
<note type="footnote">2656 Ps. xcvi. 5.</note>
<note type="footnote">2657 1 Sam. xxviii. 13.</note>
<note type="footnote">2658 Num. xxii. 20. Contrast Bp. Butler, Serm. vii.</note>

<pb n="664"/>
Father, Son and Holy Ghost to be one and the same, in no respect showing difference or
variation; from this identity of operation we necessarily infer the unity of the nature.</p>
<p>7. The Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost alike hallow, quicken, enlighten, and comfort.
No one will attribute a special and peculiar operation of hallowing to the operation of the
Spirit, after hearing the Saviour in the Gospel saying to the Father about His disciples,
sanctify them in Thy name.2659 In like manner all other operations are equally performed,
in all who are worthy of them, by the Father and by the Son and by the Holy Ghost; every
grace and virtue, guidance, life, consolation, change into the immortal, the passage into
freedom and all other good things which come down to man. Nay even the dispensation
which is above us in relation to the creature considered both in regard to intelligence and
sense, if indeed it is possible for any conjecture concerning what lies above us to be formed
from what we know, is not constituted apart from the operation and power of the Holy
Ghost, every individual sharing His help in proportion to the dignity and need of each.
Truly the ordering and administration of beings above our nature is obscure to our perception;
nevertheless any one, arguing from what is known to us, would find it more reasonable
to conclude that the power of the Spirit operates even in those beings, than that He is excluded
from the government of supramundane things. So to assert is to advance a blasphemy bare
and unsupported; it is to support absurdity on fallacy. On the other hand to agree that even
the world beyond us is governed by the power of the Spirit, as well as by that of the Father
and of the Son, is to advance a contention, supported on the plain testimony of what is seen
in human life. Identity of operation in the case of Father and of Son and of Holy Ghost
clearly proves invariability of nature. It follows that, even if the name of Godhead does
signify nature, the community of essence proves that this title is very properly applied to
the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>8. I am, however, at a loss to understand how our opponents with all their ingenuity
can adduce the title of Godhead in proof of nature, as though they had never heard from
Scripture that nature does not result from institution and appointment.2660 Moses was
made2661 a god of the Egyptians when the divine voice said, “See I have made thee a god to
Pharaoh.2662 The title therefore does give proof of a certain authority of oversight or of
action. The divine nature, on the other hand, in all the words which are contrived, remains
always inexplicable, as I always teach. We have learnt that it is beneficent, judicial, righteous,
good, and so on; and so have been taught differences of operations. But we are, nevertheless,
unable to understand the nature of the operator through our idea of the operations. Let

<pb n="665"/>
any one give an account of each one of these names, and of the actual nature to which they
are applied, and it will be found that the definition will not in both cases be the same. And
where the definition is not identical the nature is different. There is, then, a distinction to
be observed between the essence, of which no explanatory term has yet been discovered,
and the meaning of the names applied to it in reference to some operation or dignity. That
there should be no difference in the operations we infer from the community of terms. But,
we derive no clear proof of variation in nature, because, as has been said, identity of operations
indicates community of nature. If then Godhead be the name of an operation, we say
that the Godhead is one, as there is one operation of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; if, however,
as is popularly supposed, the name of Godhead indicates nature, then, since we find no
variation in the nature, we reasonably define the Holy Trinity to be of one Godhead.</p>

<p>1. The interest which you have shewn in the affairs of the Isaurian Church is only what
might have been expected from that zeal and propriety of conduct which so continually
rouses my admiration of you. The most careless observer must at once perceive that it is
in all respects more advantageous for care and anxiety to be divided among several bishops.
This has not escaped your observation, and you have done well in noting, and in acquainting
me with, the position of affairs. But it is not easy to find fit men. While, then, we are desirous
of having the credit that comes of numbers, and cause God’s Church to be more effectively
administered by more officers, let us be careful lest we unwittingly bring the word into
contempt on account of the unsatisfactory character of the men who are called to office,
and accustom the laity to indifference. You yourself know well that the conduct of the
governed is commonly of a piece with that of those who are set over them. Perhaps therefore
it might be better to appoint one well approved man, though even this may not be an easy
matter, to the supervision of the whole city, and entrust him with the management of details
on his own responsibility. Only let him be a servant of God, “a workman that needeth not
to be ashamed,”2665 not “looking on his own things,”2666 but on the things of the most,
“that they be saved.”2667 If he finds himself overweighted with responsibility, he will associate
other labourers for the harvest with himself. If only we can find such a man, I own
that I think the one worth many, and the ordering of the cure of souls in this way likely to
be attended at once with more advantage to the Churches and with less risk to us. If, however,
this course prove difficult, let us first do our best to appoint superintendents2668 to the small
townships or villages which have of old been episcopal sees. Then afterwards we will appoint

and his refusal to accept the ordination of the bishops, we may find ourselves suddenly involved

<p>On reading the letter of your reverence I heartily thanked God. I did so because I found
in your expressions traces of ancient affection. You are not like the majority. You did not
persist in refusing to begin an affectionate correspondence. You have learned the greatness
of the prize promised to the saints for humility, and so you have chosen, by taking the second

who is content to take the second place who wins a crown. But I must not be behindhand
in this virtuous rivalry, and so I thus salute your reverence in return; and inform you as to
how I am minded, in that, since agreement in the faith is established among us,2673 there
is nothing further to prevent our being one body and one spirit, as we have been called in
one hope of our calling.2674 It is for you, then, of your charity to follow up a good beginning
to rally men of like mind to stand at your side, and to appoint both time and place for
meeting. Thus, by God’s grace, through mutual accommodation we may govern the Churches
by the ancient kind of love; receiving as our own members brothers coming from the other
side, sending as to our kin, and in turn receiving as from our own kin. Such, indeed, was
once the boast of the Church. Brothers from each Church, travelling from one end of the
world to the other, were provided with little tokens, and found all men fathers and brothers.
This is a privilege whereof, like all the rest, the enemy of Christ’s Churches has robbed us.
We are confined each in his own city, and every one looks at his neighbour with distrust.
What more is to be said but that our love has grown cold,2675 whereby alone our Lord has
told us that His disciples are distinguished?2676 First of all, if you will, do you become known
to one another, that I may know with whom I am to be in agreement. Thus by common
consent we will fix on some place convenient to both, and, at a season suitable for travelling,

<p>To Aburgius.</p>
<p>Rumour, messenger of good news, is continually reporting how you dart across, like
the stars, appearing now here, now there, in the barbarian regions; now supplying the troops
with provisions, now appearing in gorgeous array before the emperor. I pray God that your
doings may prosper as they deserve, and that you may achieve eminent success. I pray that,
so long as I live and breathe this air, (for my life now is no more than drawing breath), our
country may from time to time behold you.</p>

<head>Letter CXCVII.2684</head>
<p>To Ambrose, bishop of Milan.2685</p>
<p>1. The gifts of the Lord are ever great and many; in greatness beyond measure, in
number incalculable. To those who are not insensible of His mercy one of the greatest of
these gifts is that of which I am now availing myself, the opportunity allowed us, far apart
in place though we be, of addressing one another by letter. He grants us two means of becoming
acquainted; one by personal intercourse, another by epistolary correspondence.
Now I have become acquainted with you through what you have said. I do not mean that
my memory is impressed with your outward appearance, but that the beauty of the inner
man has been brought home to me by the rich variety of your utterances, for each of us
“speaketh out of the abundance of the heart.”2686 I have given glory to God, Who in every
generation selects those who are well-pleasing to Him; Who of old indeed chose from the
sheepfold a prince for His people;2687 Who through the Spirit gifted Amos the herdman
with power and raised him up to be a prophet; Who now has drawn forth for the care of
Christ’s flock a man from the imperial city, entrusted with the government of a whole nation,
exalted in character, in lineage, in position, in eloquence, in all that this world admires.
This same man has flung away all the advantages of the world, counting them all loss that
he may gain Christ,2688 and has taken in his hand the helm of the ship, great and famous
for its faith in God, the Church of Christ. Come, then, O man of God; not from men have
you received or been taught the Gospel of Christ; it is the Lord Himself who has transferred
you from the judges of the earth to the throne of the Apostles; fight the good fight; heal the
infirmity of the people, if any are infected by the disease of Arian madness; renew the ancient
footprints of the Fathers. You have laid the foundation of affection towards me; strive to
build upon it by the frequency of your salutations. Thus shall we be able to be near one
another in spirit, although our earthly homes are far apart.</p>
<p>2. By your earnestness and zeal in the matter of the blessed bishop Dionysius you
testify all your love to the Lord, your honour for your predecessors, and your zeal for the
faith. For our disposition towards our faithful fellow-servants is referred to the Lord Whom

they have served. Whoever honours men that have contended for the faith proves that he
has like zeal for it. One single action is proof of much virtue.</p>
<p>I wish to acquaint your love in Christ that the very zealous brethren who have been
commissioned by your reverence to act for you in this good work have won praise for all
the clergy by the amiability of their manners; for by their individual modesty and conciliatoriness
they have shewn the sound condition of all. Moreover, with all zeal and diligence
they have braved an inclement season; and with unbroken perseverance have persuaded
the faithful guardians of the blessed body to transmit to them the custody of what they have
regarded as the safeguard of their lives. And you must understand that they are men who
would never have been forced by any human authority or sovereignty, had not the perseverance
of these brethren moved them to compliance. No doubt a great aid to the attainment
of the object desired was the presence of our well beloved and reverend son Therasius the
presbyter. He voluntarily undertook all the toil of the journey; he moderated the energy of
the faithful on the spot; he persuaded opponents by his arguments; in the presence of priests
and deacons, and of many others who fear the Lord, he took up the relics with all becoming
reverence, and has aided the brethren in their preservation. These relics do you receive with
a joy equivalent to the distress with which their custodians have parted with them and sent
them to you. Let none dispute; let none doubt. Here you have that unconquered athlete.
These bones, which shared in the conflict with the blessed soul, are known to the Lord.
These bones He will crown, together with that soul, in the righteous day of His requital, as
it is written, “we must stand before the judgment seat of Christ, that each may give an account
of the deeds he has done in the body.”2689 One coffin held that honoured corpse. None
other lay by his side. The burial was a noble one; the honours of a martyr were paid him.
Christians who had welcomed him as a guest and then with their own hands laid him in the
grave, have now disinterred him. They have wept as men bereaved of a father and a champion.
But they have sent him to you, for they put your joy before their own consolation.
Pious were the hands that gave; scrupulously careful were the hands that received. There
has been no room for deceit; no room for guile. I bear witness to this. Let the untainted
truth be accepted by you.</p>

<head>Letter CXCVIII.2690</head>
<p>To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.</p>
<p>After the letter conveyed to me by the officiales2691 I have received one other despatched
to me later. I have not sent many myself, for I have not found any one travelling in your
direction. But I have sent more than the four, among which also were those conveyed to
me from Samosata after the first epistle of your holiness. These I have sealed and sent to
our honourable brother Leontius, peræquator of Nicæa, urging that by his agency they may
be delivered to the steward of the household of our honourable brother Sophronius, that
he may see to their transmission to you. As my letters are going through many hands, it is
likely enough that because one man is very busy or very careless, your reverence may never
get them. Pardon me, then, I beseech you, if my letters are few. With your usual intelligence
you have properly found fault with me for not sending, as I ought, a courier of my own
when there was occasion for doing so; but you must understand that we have had a winter
of such severity that all the roads were blocked till Easter, and I had no one disposed to brave
the difficulties of the journey. For although our clergy do seem very numerous, they are
men inexperienced in travelling because they never traffic, and prefer not to live far away
from home, the majority of them plying sedentary crafts, whereby they get their daily bread.
The brother whom I have now sent to your reverence I have summoned from the country,
and employed in the conveyance of my letter to your holiness, that he may both give you
clear intelligence as to me and my affairs, and, moreover, by God’s grace, bring me back
plain and prompt information about you and yours. Our dear brother Eusebius the reader
has for some time been anxious to hasten to your holiness, but I have kept him here for the
weather to improve. Even now I am under no little anxiety lest his inexperience in travelling
may cause him trouble, and bring on some illness; for he is not robust.</p>
<p>2. I need say nothing to you by letter about the innovations of the East, for the brothers
can themselves give you accurate information. You must know, my honoured friend, that,
when I was writing these words, I was so ill that I had lost all hope of life. It is impossible
for me to enumerate all my painful symptoms, my weakness, the violence of my attacks of
fever, and my bad health in general. One point only may be selected. I have now completed
the time of my sojourn in this miserable and painful life.</p>

<head>Letter CXCIX.2692</head>
<p>Canonica Secunda.</p>
<p>To Amphilochius, concerning the Canons.</p>
<p>I wrote some time ago in reply to the questions of your reverence, but I did not send
the letter, partly because from my long and dangerous illness I had not time to do so; partly
because I had no one to send with it. I have but few men with me who are experienced in
travelling and fit for service of this kind. When you thus learn the causes of my delay, forgive
me. I have been quite astonished at your readiness to learn and at your humility. You are
entrusted with the office of a teacher, and yet you condescend to learn, and to learn of me,
who pretend to no great knowledge. Nevertheless, since you consent, on account of your
fear of God, to do what another man might hesitate to do, I am bound for my part to go
even beyond my strength in aiding your readiness and righteous zeal.</p>
<p>XVII. You asked me about the presbyter Bianor—can he be admitted among the clergy,
because of his oath? I know that I have already given the clergy of Antioch a general sentence
in the case of all those who had sworn with him; namely, that they should abstain from the
public congregations, but might perform priestly functions in private.2693 Moreover, he
has the further liberty for the performance of his ministerial functions, from the fact that

his sacred duties lie not at Antioch, but at Iconium; for, as you have written to me yourself,
he has chosen to live rather at the latter than at the former place. The man in question may,
therefore, be received; but your reverence must require him to shew repentance for the rash
readiness of the oath which he took before the unbeliever,2694 being unable to bear the
trouble of that small peril.</p>
<p>XVIII. Concerning fallen virgins, who, after professing a chaste life before the Lord,
make their vows vain, because they have fallen under the lusts of the flesh, our fathers, tenderly2695
and meekly making allowance for the infirmities of them that fall, laid down that
they might be received after a year, ranking them with the digamists. Since, however, by
God’s grace the Church grows mightier as she advances, and the order of virgins is becoming
more numerous, it is my judgment that careful heed should be given both to the act as it
appears upon consideration, and to the mind of Scripture, which may be discovered from
the context. Widowhood is inferior to virginity; consequently the sin of the widows comes
far behind that of the virgins. Let us see what Paul writes to Timothy. “The young widows
refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry; having
damnation because they have cast off their first faith.”2696 If, therefore, a widow lies under
a very heavy charge, as setting at naught her faith in Christ, what must we think of the virgin,
who is the bride of Christ, and a chosen vessel dedicated to the Lord? It is a grave fault even
on the part of a slave to give herself away in secret wedlock and fill the house with impurity,
and, by her wicked life, to wrong her owner; but it is forsooth far more shocking for the
bride to become an adulteress, and, dishonouring her union with the bridegroom, to yield
herself to unchaste indulgence. The widow, as being a corrupted slave, is indeed condemned;
but the virgin comes under the charge of adultery. We call the man who lives with another
man’s wife an adulterer, and do not receive him into communion until he has ceased from
his sin; and so we shall ordain in the case of him who has the virgin. One point, however,
must be determined beforehand, that the name virgin is given to a woman who voluntarily
devotes herself to the Lord, renounces marriage, and embraces a life of holiness. And we
admit professions dating from the age of full intelligence.2697 For it is not right in such
cases to admit the words of mere children. But a girl of sixteen or seventeen years of age,
in full possession of her faculties, who has been submitted to strict examination, and is then
<note type="footnote">2694 Videtur infidelis ille vir unus aliquis fuisse ex potentioribus Arianis ejusque furor idcirco in presbyteros

<pb n="680"/>
constant, and persists in her entreaty to be admitted, may then be ranked among the virgins,
her profession ratified, and its violation rigorously punished. Many girls are brought forward
by their parents and brothers, and other kinsfolk, before they are of full age, and have no
inner impulse towards a celibate life. The object of the friends is simply to provide for
themselves. Such women as these must not be readily received, before we have made public
investigation of their own sentiments.</p>
<p>XIX. I do not recognise the profession of men, except in the case of those who have
enrolled themselves in the order of monks, and seem to have secretly adopted the celibate
life. Yet in their case I think it becoming that there should be a previous examination, and
that a distinct profession should be received from them, so that whenever they may revert
to the life of the pleasures of the flesh, they may be subjected to the punishment of fornicators.</p>
<p>XX. I do not think that any condemnation ought to be passed on women who professed
virginity while in heresy, and then afterwards preferred marriage. “What things soever the
law saith, it saith to them who are under the law.”2698 Those who have not yet put on
Christ’s yoke do not recognise the laws of the Lord. They are therefore to be received in the
church, as having remission in the case of these sins too, as of all, from their faith in Christ.
As a general rule, all sins formerly committed in the catechumenical state are not taken into
account.2699 The Church does not receive these persons without baptism; and it is very
necessary that in such cases the birthrights should be observed.</p>
<p>XXI. If a man living with a wife is not satisfied with his marriage and falls into fornication,
I account him a fornicator, and prolong his period of punishment. Nevertheless, we
have no canon subjecting him to the charge of adultery, if the sin be committed against an
unmarried woman. For the adulteress, it is said, “being polluted shall be polluted,”2700 and
she shall not return to her husband: and “He that keepeth an adulteress is a fool and impious.”
2701 He, however, who has committed fornication is not to be cut off from the society
of his own wife. So the wife will receive the husband on his return from fornication, but
the husband will expel the polluted woman from his house. The argument here is not easy,
but the custom has so obtained.2702</p>

<p>XXII. Men who keep women carried off by violence, if they carried them off when betrothed
to other men, must not be received before removal of the women and their restoration
to those to whom they were first contracted, whether they wish to receive them, or to separate
from them. In the case of a girl who has been taken when not betrothed, she ought first to
be removed, and restored to her own people, and handed over to the will of her own people
whether parents, or brothers, or any one having authority over her. If they choose to give
her up, the cohabitation may stand; but, if they refuse, no violence should be used. In the
case of a man having a wife by seduction, be it secret or by violence, he must be held guilty
of fornication. The punishment of fornicators is fixed at four years. In the first year they
must be expelled from prayer, and weep at the door of the church; in the second they may
be received to sermon; in the third to penance; in the fourth to standing with the people,
while they are withheld from the oblation. Finally, they may be admitted to the communion
of the good gift.</p>
<p>XXIII. Concerning men who marry two sisters, or women who marry two brothers a
short letter of mine has been published, of which I have sent a copy to your reverence.2703
The man who has taken his own brother’s wife is not to be received until he have separated
from her.</p>
<p>XXIV. A widow whose name is in the list of widows, that is, who is supported2704 by
the Church, is ordered by the Apostle to be supported no longer when she marries.2705</p>
<p>There is no special rule for a widower. The punishment appointed for digamy may
suffice. If a widow who is sixty years of age chooses again to live with a husband, she shall
be held unworthy of the communion of the good gift until she be moved no longer by her
impure desire. If we reckon her before sixty years, the blame rests with us, and not with the
woman.</p>
<p>XXV. The man who retains as his wife the woman whom he has violated, shall be liable
to the penalty of rape, but it shall be lawful for him to have her to wife.</p>

best, if possible, to put asunder those who are united in fornication. If they are set on cohab

itation, let them admit the penalty of fornication. Let them be allowed to live together, lest
a worse thing happen.</p>
<p>XXVII. As to the priest ignorantly involved in an illegal marriage,2706 I have made the
fitting regulation, that he may hold his seat, but must abstain from other functions. For
such a case pardon is enough. It is unreasonable that the man who has to treat his own
wounds should be blessing another, for benediction is the imparting of holiness. How can
he who through his fault, committed in ignorance, is without holiness, impart it to another?
Let him bless neither in public nor in private, nor distribute the body of Christ to others,
nor perform any other sacred function, but, content with his seat of honour, let him beseech
the Lord with weeping, that his sin, committed in ignorance, may be forgiven.</p>
<p>XXVIII. It has seemed to me ridiculous that any one should make a vow to abstain
from swine’s flesh. Be so good as to teach men to abstain from foolish vows and promises.
Represent the use to be quite indifferent. No creature of God, received with thanksgiving,
is to be rejected.2707 The vow is ridiculous; the abstinence unnecessary.</p>
<p>XXIX. It is especially desirable that attention should be given to the case of persons in
power who threaten on oath to do some hurt to those under their authority. The remedy
is twofold. In the first place, let them be taught not to take oaths at random: secondly, not
to persist in their wicked determinations. Any one who is arrested in the design of fulfilling
an oath to injure another ought to shew repentance for the rashness of his oath, and must
not confirm his wickedness under the pretext of piety. Herod was none the better for fulfilling
his oath, when, of course only to save himself from perjury, he became the prophet’s murderer.
2708 Swearing is absolutely forbidden,2709 and it is only reasonable that the oath which
tends to evil should be condemned. The swearer must therefore change his mind, and not
persist in confirming his impiety. Consider the absurdity of the thing a little further. Suppose
a man to swear that he will put his brother’s eyes out: is it well for him to carry his oath
into action? Or to commit murder? or to break any other commandment? “I have sworn,
and I will perform it,”2710 not to sin, but to “keep thy righteous judgments.” It is no less
our duty to undo and destroy sin, than it is to confirm the commandment by immutable
counsels.</p>
<p>XXX. As to those guilty of abduction we have no ancient rule, but I have expressed my
own judgment. The period is three years;2711 the culprits and their accomplices to be ex-

cluded from service. The act committed without violence is not liable to punishment,
whenever it has not been preceded by violation or robbery. The widow is independent, and
to follow or not is in her own power. We must, therefore, pay no heed to excuses.</p>
<p>XXXI. A woman whose husband has gone away and disappeared, and who marries
another, before she has evidence of his death, commits adultery. Clerics who are guilty of
the sin unto death2712 are degraded from their order, but not excluded from the communion
of the laity. Thou shalt not punish twice for the same fault.2713</p>
<p>XXXIII. Let an indictment for murder be preferred against the woman who gives birth
to a child on the road and pays no attention to it.</p>
<p>XXXIV. Women who had committed adultery, and confessed their fault through piety,
or were in any way convicted, were not allowed by our fathers to be publicly exposed, that
we might not cause their death after conviction. But they ordered that they should be excluded
from communion till they had fulfilled their term of penance.</p>
<p>XXXV. In the case of a man deserted by his wife, the cause of the desertion must be
taken into account. If she appear to have abandoned him without reason, he is deserving
of pardon, but the wife of punishment. Pardon will be given to him that he may communicate
with the Church.</p>
<p>XXXVI. Soldiers’ wives who have married in their husbands’ absence will come under
the same principle as wives who, when their husbands have been on a journey, have not
waited their return. Their case, however, does admit of some concession on the ground of
there being greater reason to suspect death.</p>
<p>XXXVII. The man who marries after abducting another man’s wife will incur the charge
of adultery for the first case; but for the second will go free.</p>
<p>XXXVIII. Girls who follow against their fathers’ will commit fornication; but if their
fathers are reconciled to them, the act seems to admit of a remedy. They are not however
immediately restored to communion, but are to be punished for three years.</p>
<p>XXXIX. The woman who lives with an adulterer is an adulteress the whole time.2714</p>
<p>XL. The woman who yields to a man against her master’s will commits fornication; but
if afterwards she accepts free marriage, she marries. The former case is fornication; the
latter marriage. The covenants of persons who are not independent have no validity.</p>
<note type="footnote">2712 St. Basil on Isaiah iv. calls sins wilfully committed after full knowledge “sins unto death.” But in the
same commentary he applies the same designation to sins which lead to hell. The sense to be applied to the
phrase in Canon xxxii. is to be learnt, according to the Ben. note, from Canons lxix. and lxx., where a less punishment
is assigned to mere wilful sins unto death than in Canon xxxii.</note>
<note type="footnote">2713 Nahum i. 9, LXX.</note>
<note type="footnote">2714 Or, according to another reading, in every way.</note>

<pb n="684"/>
<p>XLI. The woman in widowhood, who is independent, may dwell with a husband without
blame, if there is no one to prevent their cohabitation; for the Apostle says; “but if her husband
be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.”2715</p>
<p>XLII. Marriages contracted without the permission of those in authority, are fornication.
If neither father nor master be living the contracting parties are free from blame; just as if
the authorities assent to the cohabitation, it assumes the fixity of marriage.</p>
<p>XLIII. He who smites his neighbour to death is a murderer, whether he struck first or
in self defence.</p>
<p>XLIV. The deaconess who commits fornication with a heathen may be received into

<p>XLVI. The woman who unwillingly marries a man deserted at the time by his wife, and
is afterwards repudiated, because of the return of the former to him, commits fornication,
but involuntarily. She will, therefore, not be prohibited from marriage; but it is better if she
remain as she is.2716</p>
<p>XLVII. Encratitæ,2717 Saccophori,2718 and Apotactitæ2719 are not regarded in the same
manner as Novatians, since in their case a canon has been pronounced, although different;
while of the former nothing has been said. All these I re-baptize on the same principle. If
among you their re-baptism is forbidden, for the sake of some arrangement, nevertheless
let my principle prevail. Their heresy is, as it were, an offshoot of the Marcionites, abominating,
as they do, marriage, refusing wine, and calling God’s creature polluted. We do not
therefore receive them into the Church, unless they be baptized into our baptism. Let them
not say that they have been baptized into Father, Son and Holy Ghost, inasmuch as they
make God the author of evil, after the example of Marcion and the rest of the heresies.

<p>XLVIII. The woman who has been abandoned by her husband, ought, in my judgment,
to remain as she is. The Lord said, “If any one leave2720 his wife, saving for the cause of
fornication, he causeth her to commit adultery;”2721 thus, by calling her adulteress, He excludes
her from intercourse with another man. For how can the man being guilty, as having
caused adultery, and the woman, go without blame, when she is called adulteress by the
Lord for having intercourse with another man?</p>
<p>XLIX. Suffering violation should not be a cause of condemnation. So the slave girl, if
she has been forced by her own master, is free from blame.

<p>To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.</p>
<p>I am attacked by sickness after sickness, and all the work given me, not only by the affairs
of the Church, but by those who are troubling the Church, has detained me during the whole
winter, and up to the present time. It has been therefore quite impossible for me to send
any one to you or to pay you a visit. I conjecture that you are similarly situated; not, indeed,
as to sickness, God forbid; may the Lord grant you continued health for carrying out His
commandments. But I know that the care of the Churches gives you the same distress as it
does me. I was now about to send some one to get me accurate information about your
condition. But when my well beloved son Meletius, who is moving the newly enlisted troops,
reminded me of the opportunity of my saluting you by him, I gladly accepted the occasion
to write and had recourse to the kind services of the conveyor of my letter. He is one who
may himself serve instead of a letter, both because of his amiable disposition, and of his
being well acquainted with all which concerns me. By him, then, I beseech your reverence
especially to pray for me, that the Lord may grant to me a riddance from this troublesome
body of mine; to His Churches, peace; and to you, rest; and, whenever you have settled the
affairs of Lycaonia in apostolic fashion, as you have began, an opportunity to visit also this
place. Whether I be sojourning in the flesh, or shall have been already bidden to take my
departure to the Lord, I hope that you will interest yourself in our part of the world, as your
own, as indeed it is, strengthening all that is weak, rousing all that is slothful and, by the
help of the Spirit Which abides in you, transforming everything into a condition well
pleasing to the Lord. My very honourable sons, Meletius and Melitius, whom you have
known for some time, and know to be devoted to yourself, keep in your good care and pray
for them. This is enough to keep them in safety. Salute in my name, I beg you, all who are
with your holiness, both all the clergy, and all the laity under your pastoral care, and my
very religious brothers and fellow ministers. Bear in mind the memory of the blessed martyr
Eupsychius, and do not wait for me to mention him again. Do not take pains to come on
the exact day, but anticipate it, and so give me joy, if I be yet living on this earth. Till then
may you, by the grace of the Holy One, be preserved for me and for God’s Churches, enjoying
health and wealth in the Lord, and praying for me.</p>

<p>Under other circumstances I should think it a special privilege to meet with your reverence,

But so much of my illness as still clings to me is enough to prevent my stirring ever
so short a distance. I tried to drive as far as the martyrs2726 and had a relapse almost into
my old state. You must therefore forgive me. If the matter can be put off for a few days, I
will, by God’s grace join you, and share your anxieties. If the business presses, do, by God’s

<head>Letter CCIII.2727</head>
<p>To the bishops of the sea coast.2728</p>
<p>I have had a strong desire to meet you, but from time to time some hindrance has supervened
and prevented my fulfilling my purpose. I have either been hindered by sickness,
and you know well how, from my early manhood to my present old age, this ailment has
been my constant companion, brought up with me, and chastising me, by the righteous
judgment of God, Who ordains all things in wisdom; or by the cares of the Church, or by
struggles with the opponents of the doctrines of truth. <del>Up to this day I live in much affliction
and grief, having the feeling present before me, that you are wanting to me. For when God
tells me, who took on Him His sojourn in the flesh for the very purpose that, by patterns of
duty, He might regulate our life, and might by His own voice announce to us the Gospel of
the kingdom,—when He says, ‘By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye love
one another,’ and whereas the Lord left His own peace to His disciples as a farewell gift,2729
when about to complete the dispensation in the flesh, saying, ‘Peace I leave with you, My
peace I give you,’ I cannot persuade myself that without love to others, and without, as far
as rests with me, peaceableness towards all, I can be called a worthy servant of Jesus Christ.
I have waited a long while for the chance of your love paying us a visit. For ye are not ignorant
that we, being exposed to all, as rocks running out in the sea, sustain the fury of the
heretical waves, which, in that they break around us, do not cover the district behind. I say
“we” in order to refer it, not to human power, but to the grace of God, Who, by the weakness
of men shows His power, as says the prophet in the person of the Lord, ‘Will ye not fear Me,
who have placed the sand as a boundary to the sea?’ for by the weakest and most contemptible
of all things, the sand, the Mighty One has bounded the great and full sea. Since, then, this
is our position, it became your love to be frequent in sending true brothers to visit us who
labour with the storm, and more frequently letters of love, partly to confirm our courage,
partly to correct any mistake of ours. For we confess that we are liable to numberless mistakes,
being men, and living in the flesh.</del></p>

he addressed an expostulation with these separatists for not coming to him. (Ch. of the Fathers, p. 95.) The

some of the calumnies spread abroad about me, you did not think me deserving of being
visited by you in love. Now, therefore, I myself take the initiative. I beg to state that I am
perfectly ready to rid myself, in your presence, of the charges urged against me, but only on
condition that my revilers are admitted to stand face to face with me before your reverences.
If I am convicted, I shall not deny my error. You, after the conviction, will receive pardon
from the Lord for withdrawing yourselves from the communion of me a sinner. The successful
accusers, too, will have their reward in the publication of my secret wickedness. If,
however, you condemn me before you have the evidence before you, I shall be none the
worse, barring the loss I shall sustain of a possession I hold most dear—your love: while
you, for your part, will suffer the same loss in losing me, and will seem to be running counter
to the words of the Gospel: “Doth our law judge any man before it hear him?”2730 The reviler,
moreover, if he adduce no proof of what he says, will be shewn to have got nothing
from his wicked language but a bad name for himself. For what name can be properly applied
to the slanderer2731 except that which he professes to bear by the very conduct of which he
is guilty? Let the reviler, therefore, appear not as slanderer,2732 but as accuser; nay, I will
not call him accuser, I will rather regard him as a brother, admonishing in love, and producing
conviction for my amendment. And you must not be hearers of calumny, but triers
of proof. Nor must I be left uncured, because my sin is not being made manifest.</p>
<p><del>3. Let not this consideration influence you. ‘We dwell on the sea, we are exempt from
the sufferings of the generality, we need no succour from others; so what is the good to us
of foreign communion?’ For the same Lord Who divided the islands from the continent
by the sea, bound the island Christians to those of the continent by love. Nothing, brethren,
separates us from each other, but deliberate estrangement. We have one Lord, one faith,
the same hope. The hands need each other; the feet steady each other. The eyes possess
their clear apprehension from agreement. We, for our part, confess our own weakness, and
we seek your fellow feeling. For we are assured, that though ye are not present in body, yet
by the aid of prayer, ye will do us much benefit in these most critical times. It is neither
decorous before men, nor pleasing to God, that you should make avowals which not even
the Gentiles adopt, which know not God. Even they, as we hear, though the country they
live in be sufficient for all things, yet, on account of the uncertainty of the future, make
much of alliances with each other, and seek mutual intercourse as being advantageous to
them. Yet we, the sons of fathers who have laid down the law that by brief notes the proofs
of communion should be carried about from one end of the earth to the other, and that all
should be citizens and familiars with all, now sever ourselves from the whole world, and are </del>

<del>neither ashamed at our solitariness, nor shudder that on us is fallen the fearful prophecy of
the Lord, ‘Because of lawlessness abounding, the love of the many shall wax cold.’</del></p>
<p>4. Do not, most honourable brethren, do not suffer this. Rather, by letters of peace and
by salutations of love, comfort me for the past. You have made a wound in my heart by
your former neglect. Soothe its anguish, as it were, by a tender touch. Whether you wish
to come to me, and examine for yourselves into the truth of what you hear of my infirmities,
or whether by the addition of more lies my sins are reported to you to be yet more grievous,
I must accept even this. I am ready to welcome you with open hands and to offer myself to
the strictest test, only let love preside over the proceedings. Or if you prefer to indicate any
spot in your own district to which I may come and pay you the visit which is due, submitting
myself, as far as may be, to examination, for the healing of the past, and the prevention of
slander for the future, I accept this. Although my flesh is weak, yet, as long as I breathe, I
am responsible for the due discharge of every duty which may tend to the edification of the
Churches of Christ. Do not, I beseech you, make light of my entreaty. Do not force me to
disclose my distress to others. Hitherto, brethren, as you are well aware, I have kept my
grief to myself, for I blush to speak of your alienation from me to those of our communion
who are at a distance. I shrink at once from paining them and from gratifying those who
hate me. I alone am writing this now; but I send in the name of all the brethren in Cappadocia,
who have charged me not to employ any chance messenger, but some one who, in case
I should, from my anxiety not to be too prolix, leave out any points of importance, might
supply them with the intelligence wherewith God has gifted him. I refer to my beloved and
reverend fellow presbyter Petrus. Welcome him in love, and send him forth to me in peace,
that he may be a messenger to me of good things.</p>

<p>To the Neocæsareans.2734</p>
<p>1. <del>There has been a long silence on both sides, revered and well-beloved brethren, just
as if there were angry feelings between us. Yet who is there so sullen and implacable towards
the party which has injured him, as to lengthen out the resentment which has begun in
disgust through almost a whole life of man?</del> This <del>is happening in our case, no just occasion
of estrangement existing, as far as I myself know, but on the contrary, there being, from the
first, many strong reasons for the closest friendship and unity. The greatest and first is this,
our Lord’s command, pointedly saying, “By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples
if ye have love one to another.”273</del> Again, the apostle clearly sets before us the good of
charity where he tells us that love is the fulfilling of the law;2736 and again where he says
that charity is a good thing to be preferred to all great and good things, in the words, “Though
I speak with tongues of men and of angels and have not charity, I am become as sounding
brass or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all
mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains,
and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and
though I give my body to be burnt and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.”2737 Not
that each of the points enumerated could be performed without love, but that the Holy One
wishes, as He Himself has said, to attribute to the commandment super-eminent excellency
by the figure of hyperbole.2738</p>

in order to the throne of your episcopate, like stars rising one after another, have tracked

union and fellowship, these rights also exist naturally for you and me. [Why is it,
then, O venerable among cities, for through you I address the whole city, that no civil writing
comes from you, no welcome voice, but your ears are open to those who aim at slander?]
I am therefore the more bound to groan, the more I perceive the end they have in view.
There is no doubt as to who is the originator of the slander.2739 He is known by many evil
deeds, but is best distinguished by this particular wickedness, and it is for this reason that
the sin is made his name.2740 But you must put up with my plain speaking. You have
opened both ears to my slanderers. You heartily welcome all you hear without any enquiry.
Not one of you distinguishes between lies and truth. Who ever suffered for lack of wicked
accusations when struggling all alone? Who was ever convicted of lying in the absence of
his victim? What plea does not sound plausible to the hearers when the reviler persists that
such and such is the case, and the reviled is neither present nor hears what is urged against
him? Does not even the accepted custom of this world teach you, in reference to these
matters, that if any one is to be a fair and impartial hearer, he must not be entirely led away
by the first speaker, but must wait for the defence of the accused, that so truth may be
demonstrated by a comparison of the arguments on both sides? “Judge righteous judgment.”
2741 This precept is one of those most necessary for salvation.</p>
<p>3. When I say this I am not forgetful of the words of the Apostle, who fled from human
tribunals and reserved the defence of all his life for the unerring judgment seat, when he
said, “With me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you or of man’s judgment.”
2742 Your ears have been preoccupied by lying slanders, slanders that have touched
my conduct, slanders that have touched my faith in God. Nevertheless, knowing, as I do,
that three persons at once are injured by the slanderer, his victim, his hearer, and himself;
as to my own wrong, I would have held my tongue, be sure; not because I despise your good
opinion, (how could I, writing now as I do and earnestly pleading as I do that I may not lose
it?) but because I see that of the three sufferers the one who is least injured is myself. It is
true that I shall be robbed of you, but you are being robbed of the truth, and he who is at
the bottom of all this is parting me from you, but he is alienating himself from the Lord,
inasmuch as no one can be brought near to the Lord by doing what is forbidden. Rather

shall not be judged;”2744 and “Condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned.”2745 <del>In a
word, brethren, if my offences admit of cure, why does not such an one obey the teacher of
the Churches, “Reprove, exhort, rebuke”?2746 If, on the other hand, my iniquity be past

The same thing frequently takes place with regard to the force of words, when the critic is
inferior to the writer. The critic ought really to set out with much the same training and
equipment as the author. A man ignorant of agriculture is quite incapable of criticising
husbandry, and the distinctions between harmony and discord can only be adequately
judged by a trained musician. But any one who chooses will set up for a literary critic,
though he cannot tell us where he went to school, or how much time was spent in his education,
and knows nothing about letters at all. I see clearly that, even in the case of the
words2749 of the Holy Spirit, the investigation of the terms is to be attempted not by every
one, but by him who has the spirit of discernment, as the Apostle has taught us, in the differences
of gifts;—“For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word
of knowledge by the same Spirit; to another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gift of
healing by the same Spirit; to another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another
discerning of spirits.”2750 If, therefore, my gifts are spiritual, he who wishes to judge
them must shew proof of his own possession of the gift of “discerning of spirits.” If, on the
contrary, as he calumniously contends, my gifts are of the wisdom of this world, let him
shew that he is an adept in this world’s wisdom, and I will submit myself to his verdict. And

taught me the words of the blessed Gregory; which, as far as memory had preserved down
to her day, she cherished herself, while she fashioned and formed me, while yet a child, upon
the doctrines of piety. And when I gained the capacity of thought, my reason being matured

journey to God. And up to this day, by the grace of Him who has called me in His holy
calling to the knowledge of Himself, I know of no doctrine opposed to the sound teaching
having sunk into my heart; nor was my soul ever polluted by the ill-famed blasphemy of
Arius. If I have ever received into communion any who have come from that teacher, hiding
their unsoundness deep within them, or speaking words of piety, or, at any rate, not opposing
what has been said by me, it is on these terms that I have admitted them; and I have not allowed
my judgment concerning them to rest wholly with myself, but have followed the decisions
given about them by our Fathers. For after receiving the letter of the very blessed
Father Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, which I hold in my hand, and shew to any one
who asks, wherein he has distinctly declared that any one expressing a wish to come over
from the heresy of the Arians and accepting the Nicene Creed, is to be received without
hesitation and difficulty, citing in support of his opinion the unanimous assent of the bishops
of Macedonia and of Asia; I, considering myself bound to follow the high authority of such
a man and of those who made the rule, and with every desire on my own part to win the
reward promised to peacemakers, did enroll in the lists of communicants all who accepted
that creed.</p>
<p>7. <del>The fair thing would be to judge of me, not from one or two who do not walk uprightly
in the truth, but from the multitude of bishops throughout the world, connected
with me by the grace of the Lord. Make enquiries of Pisidians, Lycaonians, Isaurians,
Phrygians of both provinces, Armenians your neighbours, Macedonians, Achæans, Illyrians,
Gauls, Spaniards, the whole of Italy, Sicilians, Africans, the healthy part of Egypt, whatever
is left of Syria; all of whom send letters to me, and in turn receive them from me.</del> From
these letters, alike from all which are despatched from them. and from all which go out from
us to them, you may learn that we are all of one mind, and of one opinion. <del>Whoso shuns
communion with me, it cannot escape your accuracy, cuts himself off from the whole
Church. Look round about, brethren, with whom do you hold communion? If you will
not receive it from me, who remains to acknowledge you? Do not reduce me to the necessity
of counselling anything unpleasant concerning a Church so dear to me.</del> There are things
now which I hide in the bottom of my heart, in secret groaning over and bewailing the evil
days in which we live, in that the greatest Churches which have long been united to one
another in brotherly love, now, without any reason, are in mutual opposition. Do not, oh!
do not, drive me to complain of these things to all who are in communion with me. Do not
force me to give utterance to words which hitherto I have kept in check by reflection and
have hidden in my heart. Better were it for me to be removed and the Churches to be at
one, than that God’s people should suffer such evil through our childish ill-will. <del>Ask your

<p>To Elpidius the bishop.2752</p>
<p>Once again I have started the well-beloved presbyter Meletius to carry my greeting to
you. I had positively determined to spare him, on account of the weakness which he has
voluntarily brought upon himself, by bringing his body into subjection for the sake of the
gospel of Christ. But I have judged it fitting to salute you by the ministry of such men as
he is, able to supply of themselves all the shortcomings of my letter, and to become, alike
to writer and recipient, a kind of living epistle. I am also carrying out the very strong wish,
which he has always had, to see your excellency, ever since he has had experience of the
high qualities you possess. So now I have besought him to travel to you, and through him
I discharge the debt of the visit I owe you, and beseech you to pray for me and for the Church
of God, that the Lord may grant me deliverance from the injuries of the enemies of the
Gospel, and to pass my life in peace and quiet. Nevertheless, if you in your wisdom, think
it needful that we should travel to the same spot, and meet the rest of our right honourable
brother bishops of the sea board regions, do you yourself point out a suitable place and time
where and when this meeting may take place. Write to our brethren to the end that each
and all may, at the appointed time, leave the business they may have in hand, and may be
able to effect something for the edification of the Churches of God, do away with the pain
which we now suffer from our mutual suspicions, and establish love, without which the
Lord Himself has ordained that obedience to every commandment must be of none effect.</p>

<p>To Elpidius the bishop. Consolatory.</p>
<p>Now, most of all, do I feel my bodily infirmity, when I see how it stands in the way of
my soul’s good. Had matters gone as I hoped, I should not now be speaking to you by letter
or by messenger, but should in my own person have been paying the debt of affection and
enjoying spiritual advantage face to face. Now, however, I am so situated that I am only too
glad if I am able even to move about in my own country in the necessary visitation of parishes
in my district. But may the Lord grant to you both strength and a ready will, and to me, in
addition to my eager desire, ability to enjoy your society when I am in the country of
Comana. I am afraid lest your domestic trouble may be some hindrance to you. For I have
learnt of your affliction in the loss of your little boy. To a grandfather his death cannot but
be grievous. On the other hand to a man who has attained to so high a degree of virtue, and
alike from his experience of this world and his spiritual training knows what human nature
is, it is natural that the removal of those who are near and dear should not be wholly intolerable.
The Lord requires from us what He does not require from every one. The common
mass of mankind lives by habit, but the Christian’s rule of life is the commandment of the
Lord, and the example of holy men of old, whose greatness of soul was, above all, exhibited
in adversity. To the end, then, that you may yourself leave to them that come after you an
example of fortitude and of genuine trust in what we hope for, show that you are not vanquished
by your grief, but are rising above your sorrows, patient in affliction, and rejoicing
in hope. Pray let none of these things be a hindrance to our hoped for meeting. Children,
indeed, are held blameless on account of their tender age; but you and I are under the responsibility
of serving the Lord, as He commands us, and in all things to be ready for the
administration of the affairs of the Churches. For the due discharge of that duty the Lord
has reserved great rewards for faithful and wise stewards.</p>

<head>Letter CCVII.2754</head>
<p>To the clergy of Neocæsarea.</p>
<p>You all concur in hating me. To a man you have followed the leader of the war against
me.2755 I was therefore minded to say not a word to any one. I determined that I would
write no friendly letter; that I would start no communication, but keep my sorrow in silence
to myself. Yet it is wrong to keep silence in the face of calumny; not that by contradiction
we may vindicate ourselves, but that we may not allow a lie to travel further and its victims
to be harmed. I have therefore thought it necessary to put this matter also before you all,
and to write a letter to you, although, when I recently wrote to all the presbyterate in common,
you did not do me the honour to send me a reply. Do not, my brethren, gratify the vanity
of those who are filling your minds with pernicious opinions. Do not consent to look lightly
on, when, to your knowledge, God’s people are being subverted by impious teaching. None
but Sabellius the Libyan2756 and Marcellus the Galatian2757 have dared to teach and write
what the leaders of your people are attempting to bring forward among you as their own
private discovery. They are making a great talk about it, but they are perfectly powerless to
give their sophisms and fallacies even any colour of truth. In their harangues against me
they shrink from no wickedness, and persistently refuse to meet me. Why? Is it not because
they are afraid of being convicted for their own wicked opinions? Yes; and in their attacks
upon me they have become so lost to all sense of shame as to invent certain dreams to my
discredit while they falsely accuse my teaching of being pernicious. Let them take upon
their own heads all the visions of the autumn months; they can fix no blasphemy on me,
for in every Church there are many to testify to the truth.</p>
<p>2. When they are asked the reason for this furious and truceless war, they allege psalms
and a kind of music varying from the custom which has obtained among you, and similar
pretexts of which they ought to be ashamed. We are, moreover, accused because we maintain
men in the practice of true religion who have renounced the world and all those cares of
this life, which the Lord likens to thorns that do not allow the word to bring forth fruit.
Men of this kind carry about in the body the deadness of Jesus; they have taken up their
own cross, and are followers of God. I would gladly give my life if these really were my
faults, and if I had men with me owning me as teacher who had chosen this ascetic life. I
hear that virtue of this kind is to be found now in Egypt, and there are, peradventure, some

men in Palestine whose conversation follows the precepts of the Gospel. I am told too that
some perfect and blessed men are to be found in Mesopotamia. We, in comparison with
the perfect, are children. But if women also have chosen to live the Gospel life, preferring
virginity to wedlock, leading captive the lust of the flesh, and living in the mourning which
is called blessed, they are blessed in their profession wherever they are to be found. We,
however, have few instances of this to show, for with us people are still in an elementary
stage and are being gradually brought. to piety. If any charges of disorder are brought against
the life of our women I do not undertake to defend them. One thing, however, I do say and
that is, that these bold hearts, these unbridled mouths are ever fearlessly uttering what Satan,
the father of lies, has hitherto been unable to say. I wish you to know that we rejoice to have
assemblies of both men and women, whose conversation is in heaven and who have crucified
the flesh with the affections and lusts thereof; they take no thought for food and raiment,
but remain undisturbed beside their Lord, continuing night and day in prayer. Their lips
speak not of the deeds of men: they sing hymns to God continually, working with their own
hands that they may have to distribute to them that need.</p>
<p>3. Now as to the charge relating to the singing of psalms, whereby my calumniators
specially scare the simpler folk, my reply is this. The customs which now obtain are agreeable
to those of all the Churches of God. Among us the people go at night to the house of prayer,
and, in distress, affliction, and continual tears, making confession to God, at last rise from
their prayers and begin to sing psalms. And now, divided into two parts, they sing antiphonally
with one another, thus at once confirming their study of the Gospels,2758 and at the
same time producing for themselves a heedful temper and a heart free from distraction.
Afterwards they again commit the prelude of the strain to one, and the rest take it up; and
so after passing the night in various psalmody, praying at intervals as the day begins to dawn,
all together, as with one voice and one heart, raise the psalm of confession to the Lord, each
forming for himself his own expressions of penitence. If it is for these reasons that you renounce
me, you will renounce the Egyptians; you will renounce both Libyans, Thebans,
Palestinians, Arabians, Phoenicians, Syrians, the dwellers by the Euphrates; in a word all
those among whom vigils, prayers, and common psalmody have been held in honour.</p>
<p>4. But, it is alleged, these practices were not observed in the time of the great Gregory.
My rejoinder is that even the Litanies2759 which you now use were not used in his time. I
do not say this to find fault with you; for my prayer would be that every one of you should
live in tears and continual penitence. We, for our part, are always offering supplication for

our sins, but we propitiate our God not as you do, in the words of mere man, but in the oracles
of the Spirit. And what evidence have you that this custom was not followed in the
time of the great Gregory? You have kept none of his customs up to the present time.2760
Gregory did not cover his head at prayer. How could he? He was a true disciple of the
Apostle who says, “Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth
his head.”2761 And “a man indeed ought not to cover his head forasmuch as he is the image
of God.”2762 Oaths were shunned by Gregory, that pure soul, worthy of the fellowship of
the Holy Ghost, content with yea and nay, in accordance with the commandment of the
Lord Who said, “I say unto you swear not at all.”2763 Gregory could not bear to call his
brother a fool,2764 for he stood in awe of the threat of the Lord. Passion, wrath, and bitterness
never proceeded out of his mouth. Railing he hated, because it leads not to the kingdom of
heaven. Envy and arrogance had been shut out of that guiltless soul. He would never have
stood at the altar before being reconciled to his brother. A lie, or any word designed to
slander any one, he abominated, as one who knew that lies come from the devil, and that
the Lord will destroy all that utter a lie.2765 If you have none of these things, and are clear
of all, then are you verily disciples of the disciple of the Lord; if not, beware lest, in your
disputes about the mode of singing psalms, you are straining at the gnat and setting at naught
the greatest of the commandments.</p>
<p>I have been driven to use these expressions by the urgency of my defence, that you may
be taught to cast the beam out of your own eyes before you try to remove other men’s motes.
Nevertheless, I am conceding all, although there is nothing that is not searched into before
God. Only let great matters prevail, and do not allow innovations in the faith to make
themselves heard. Do not disregard the hypostases. Do not deny the name of Christ. Do

tolerate no change, and allowed no monasteries and no enrichment of their liturgies with new rites. “Litanies,”
however, are regarded as comparatively unimportant innovations. The note concludes: Neque enim secum ipse

<p>To the notables of Neocæsarea.</p>
<p>I am really under no obligation to publish my own mind to you, or to state the reasons
for my present sojourn where I am; it is not my custom to indulge in self advertisement,
nor is the matter worth publicity. I am not, I think, following my own inclinations; I am
answering the challenge of your leaders. I have always striven to be ignored more earnestly
than popularity hunters strive after notoriety. But, I am told, the ears of everybody in your
town are set a thrilling, while certain tale-mongers, creators of lies, hired for this very work,
are giving you a history of me and my doings. I therefore do not think that I ought to
overlook your being exposed to the teaching of vile intention and foul tongue; I think that
I am bound to tell you myself in what position I am placed. From my childhood I have been
familiar with this spot, for here I was brought up by my grandmother;2769 hither I have often
retreated, and here I have spent many years, when endeavouring to escape from the hubbub
of public affairs, for experience has taught me that the quiet and solitude of the spot are favourable
to serious thought. Moreover as my brothers2770 are now living here, I have gladly
retired to this retreat, and have taken a brief breathing time from the press of the labours
that beset me, not as a centre from which I might give trouble to others, but to indulge my
own longing.</p>

and making me matter for talk over the cups at public entertainments? Had slander been

among you came to see me.2771 Afterwards, when you all crowded round me, what were
you not ready to give? what not to promise? Nevertheless you were not able to keep me.
How then could I, who at that time would not listen when you invited me, now attempt to
thrust myself on you uninvited? How could I, who when you complimented and admired
me, avoided you, have been intending to court you now that you calumniate me? Nothing
of the kind, sirs; I am not quite so cheap. No man in his senses would go on board a boat
without a steersman, or get alongside a Church where the men sitting at the helm are
themselves stirring up tempest and storm. Whose fault was it that the town was all full of
tumult, when some were running away with no one after them, and others stealing off when
no invader was near, and all the wizards and dream-tellers were flourishing their bogeys?
Whose fault was it else? Does not every child know that it was the mob-leaders’? The
reasons of their hatred to me it would be bad taste on my part to recount; but they are quite
easy for you to apprehend. When bitterness and division have come to the last pitch of
savagery, and the explanation of the cause is altogether groundless and ridiculous, then the
mental disease is plain, dangerous indeed to other people’s comfort, but greatly and personally
calamitous to the patient. And there is one charming point about them. Torn and racked
with inward agony as they are, they cannot yet for very shame speak out about it. The state
they are in may be known not only from their behaviour to me, but from the rest of their
conduct. If it were unknown, it would not much matter. But the veritable cause of their
shunning communication with me may be unperceived by the majority among you. Listen;
and I will tell you.</p>
<p>3. There is going on among you a movement ruinous to the faith, disloyal to the
apostolical and evangelical dogmas, disloyal too to the tradition of Gregory the truly great,2772
and of his successors up to the blessed Musonius, whose teaching is still ringing in your
ears.2773 For those men, who, from fear of confutation, are forging figments against me,
are endeavouring to renew the old mischief of Sabellius, started long ago, and extinguished
by the tradition of the great Gregory. But do you bid goodbye to those wine-laden heads,
bemuddled by the swelling fumes that mount from their debauch, and from me who am
wide awake and from fear of God cannot keep silence, hear what plague is rife among you.

and makes the hypostasis of the three one,2776 what is this but to deny the everlasting preexistence
of the Only begotten? He denies too the Lord’s sojourn among men in the incarnation,
2777 the going down into hell, the resurrection, the judgment; he denies also the
proper operations of the Spirit. And I hear that even rasher innovations than those of the
foolish Sabellius are now ventured on among you. It is said, and that on the evidence of ear
witnesses, that your clever men go to such an extreme as to say that there is no tradition of
the name of the Only-begotten, while of the name of the adversary there is; and at this they
are highly delighted and elated, as though it were a discovery of their own. For it is said, “I
came in my Father’s name and ye received me not; if another shall come in his own name,
him ye will receive.”2778 And because it is said, “Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them
in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,”2779 it is obvious, they
urge, that the name is one, for it is not “in the names,” but “in the name.”</p>
<p>4. I blush so to write to you, for the men thus guilty are of my own blood;2780 and I
groan for my own soul, in that, like boxers fighting two men at once, I can only give the
truth its proper force by hitting with my proofs, and knocking down, the errors of doctrine
on the right and on the left. On one side I am attacked by the Anomoean: on the other by
the Sabellian. Do not, I implore you, pay any attention to these abominable and impotent
sophisms. Know that the name of Christ which is above every name is His being called Son
of God, as Peter says, “There is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby
we must be saved.”2781 And as to the words “I came in my Father’s name,” it is to be understood
that He so says describing His Father as origin and cause of Himself.2782 And if it is
said “Go and baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost,” we
must not suppose that here one name is delivered to us. For just as he who said Paul and
Silvanus and Timothy mentioned three names, and coupled them one to the other by the
word “and,” so He who spoke of the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, mentioned three,
and united them by the conjunction, teaching that with each name must be understood its
own proper meaning; for the names mean things. And no one gifted with even the smallest
particle of intelligence doubts that the existence belonging to the things is peculiar and

Basil’s sumpter mules, and Gregory of Nazianzus fought stoutly for his friend, that led to Basil’s erecting Sasima

two, but in hypostasis one.2786 The men who congratulate themselves on the subtilty of
their intelligence could not perceive that this is said not in reference to dogmatic opinion,
but in controversy with Ælian. And in this dispute there are not a few copyists’ blunders,
as, please God, I shall shew in the case of the actual expressions used. But in his endeavour
to convince the heathen, he deemed it needless to be nice about the words he employed; he
judged it wiser sometimes to make concessions to the character of the subject who was being
persuaded, so as not to run counter to the opportunity given him. This explains how it is
that you may find there many expressions which now give great support to the heretics, as
for instance “creature”2787 and “thing made”2788 and the like. But those who ignorantly
criticise these writings refer to the question of the Godhead much that is said in reference
to the conjunction with man; as is the case with this passage which they are hawking about.
For it is indispensable to have clear understanding that, as he who fails to confess the community
of the essence or substance falls into polytheism, so he who refuses to grant the
distinction of the hypostases is carried away into Judaism. For we must keep our mind
stayed, so to say, on certain underlying subject matter, and, by forming a clear impression
of its distinguishing lines, so arrive at the end desired. For suppose we do not bethink us
of the Fatherhood, nor bear in mind Him of whom this distinctive quality is marked off,
how can we take in the idea of God the Father? For merely to enumerate the differences of
Persons2789 is insufficient; we must confess each Person2790 to have a natural existence in
real hypostasis. Now Sabellius did not even deprecate the formation of the persons without
hypostasis, saying as he did that the same God, being one in matter,2791 was metamorphosed
as the need of the moment required, and spoken of now as Father, now as Son, and now as
Holy Ghost. The inventors of this unnamed heresy are renewing the old long extinguished
error; those, I mean, who are repudiating the hypostases, and denying the name of the Son
of God. They must give over uttering iniquity against God,2792 or they will have to wail
with them that deny the Christ.</p>
<note type="footnote">2786 The Ben. note refused to believe that so Sabellian an expression can have been used by Gregory. Basil’s
explanation is that it was used in controversy with a heathen on another subject, loosely and not dogmatically.
The words are said not to be found in any extant document attributed to Gregory, whether genuine or doubtful.
But they may be matched in some of the expressions of Athanasius. cf. p. 195. Ath., Tom. ad Af. § 4 and Hom.

<p>6. I have felt compelled to write to you in these terms, that you may be on your guard
against the mischief arising from bad teaching. If we may indeed liken pernicious teachings
to poisonous drugs, as your dream-tellers have it, these doctrines are hemlock and
monkshood, or any other deadly to man. It is these that destroy souls; not my words, as
this shrieking drunken scum, full of the fancies of their condition, make out. If they had
any sense they ought to know that in souls, pure and cleansed from all defilement, the
prophetic gift shines clear. In a foul mirror you cannot see what the reflexion is, neither
can a soul preoccupied with cares of this life, and darkened with the passions of the lust of
the flesh, receive the rays of the Holy Ghost. Every dream is not a prophecy, as says
Zechariah, “The Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain,…for the
idols have spoken vanity and the diviners have told false dreams.”2793 Those who, as Isaiah
says, dream and love to sleep in their bed2794 forget that an operation of error is sent to “the
children of disobedience.”2795 And there is a lying spirit, which arose in false prophecies,
and deceived Ahab.2796 Knowing this they ought not to have been so lifted up as to ascribe
the gift of prophecy to themselves. They are shewn to fall far short even of the case of the
seer Balaam; for Balaam when invited by the king of Moab with mighty bribes brooked not
to utter a word beyond the will of God, nor to curse Israel whom the Lord cursed not.2797
If then their sleep-fancies do not tally with the commandments of the Lord, let them be
content with the Gospels. The Gospels need no dreams to add to their credit. The Lord
has sent His peace to us, and left us a new commandment, to love one another, but dreams
bring strife and division and destruction of love. Let them therefore not give occasion to
the devil to attack their souls in sleep; nor make their imaginations of more authority than
the instruction of salvation.</p>

<p>To Hilarius.2801</p>
<p>1. You can imagine what I felt, and in what state of mind I was, when I came to Dazimon
and found that you had left a few days before my arrival. From my boyhood I have held
you in admiration, and, therefore, ever since our old school days, have placed a high value
on intercourse with you. But another reason for my doing so is that nothing is so precious
now as a soul that loves the truth, and is gifted with a sound judgment in practical affairs.
This, I think, is to be found in you. I see most men, as in the hippodrome, divided into
factions, some for one side and some for another, and shouting with their parties. But you
are above fear, flattery, and every ignoble sentiment, and so naturally look at truth with an
unprejudiced eye. And I see that you are deeply interested in the affairs of the Churches,
about which you have sent me a letter, as you have said in your last. I should like to know
who took charge of the conveyance of this earlier epistle, that I may know who has wronged
me by its loss. No letter from you on this subject has yet reached me.</p>
<p>2. How much, then, would I not have given to meet you, that I might tell you all my
troubles? When one is in pain it is, as you know, some alleviation, even to describe it. How
gladly would I have answered your questions, not trusting to lifeless letters, but in my own
person, narrating each particular. The persuasive force of living words is more efficient and
they are not so susceptible as letters to attack and to misrepresentation. For now no one
has left anything untried, and the very men in whom I put the greatest confidence, men,
who when I saw them among others, I used to think something more than human, have
received documents written by some one, and have sent them on, whatever they are, as
mine, and on their account are calumniating me to the brethren as though there is nothing
now that pious and faithful men ought to hold in greater abhorrence than my name. From
the beginning it has been my object to live unknown, to a degree not reached by anyone
who has considered human infirmity; but now, just as though on the other hand it had been
my purpose to make myself notorious to the world, I have been talked about all over the
earth, and I may add all over the sea too. For men, who go to the last limit of impiety, and
are introducing into the Churches the godless opinion of Unlikeness,2802 are waging war
against me. Those too who hold the via media,2803 as they think, and, though they start

in your bodily infirmity, to bear yourself bravely and worthy of the God Who has called us.

<p>Without address.</p>
<p>1. May the Lord, Who has brought me prompt help in my afflictions, grant you the
help of the refreshment wherewith you have refreshed me by writing to me, rewarding you
for your consolation of my humble self with the real and great gladness of the Spirit. For I
was indeed downcast in soul when I saw in a great multitude the almost brutish and unreasonable
insensibility of the people, and the inveterate and ineradicable unsatisfactoriness of
their leaders. But I saw your letter; I saw the treasure of love which it contained; then I knew
that He Who ordains all our lives had made some sweet consolation shine on me in the
bitterness of my life. I therefore salute your holiness in return, and exhort you, as is my
wont, not to cease to pray for my unhappy life, that I may never, drowned in the unrealities
of this world, forget God, “who raiseth up the poor out of the dust;”2805 that I may never
be lifted up with pride and fall into the condemnation of the devil;2806 that I may never be
found by the Lord neglectful of my stewardship and asleep; never discharging it amiss, and
wounding the conscience of my fellow-servants;2807 and, never companying with the
drunken, suffer the pains threatened in God’s just judgment against wicked stewards. I beseech
you, therefore, in all your prayers to pray God that I may be watchful in all things;
that I may be no shame or disgrace to the name of Christ, in the revelation of the secrets of
my heart, in the great day of the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ.</p>

to the court, in the name of peace. Learn too that on being so informed, this bishop2808
wrote to me to hasten to Mesopotamia, and, after assembling together those who in that
country are of like sentiments with us, and are strengthening the state of the Church, to
travel in their company to the emperor. But perhaps my health will not be good enough to
allow me to undertake a journey in the winter. Indeed, hitherto I have not thought the
matter pressing, unless you advise it. I shall therefore await your counsel that my mind may
be made up. Lose no time then, I beg you, in making known to me, by means of one of our
trusty brethren, what course seems best to the divinely guided intelligence of your excellency.</p>

<head>Letter CCXIV.2809</head>
<p>To Count Terentius.2810</p>
<p>1. When I heard that your excellency had again been compelled to take part in public
affairs, I was straightway distressed (for the truth must be told) at the thought of how contrary
to your mind it must be that you after once giving up the anxieties of official life, and allowing
yourself leisure for the care of your soul, should again be forced back into your old career.
But then I bethought me that peradventure the Lord has ordained that your lordship should
again appear in public from this wish to grant the boon of one alleviation for the countless
pains which now beset the Church in our part of the world. I am, moreover, cheered by the
thought that I am about to meet your excellency once again before I depart this life.</p>
<p>2. But a further rumour has reached me that you are in Antioch, and are transacting
the business in hand with the chief authorities. And, besides this, I have heard that the
brethren who are of the party of Paulinus are entering on some discussion with your excellency
on the subject of union with us; and by “us” I mean those who are supporters of the
blessed man of God, Meletius.2811 I hear, moreover, that the Paulinians are carrying about
a letter of the Westerns,2812 assigning to them the episcopate of the Church in Antioch, but
speaking under a false impression of Meletius, the admirable bishop of the true Church of
God. I am not astonished at this. They2813 are totally ignorant of what is going on here;
the others, though they might be supposed to know, give an account to them in which party
is put before truth; and it is only what one might expect that they should either be ignorant
of the truth, or should even endeavour to conceal the reasons which led the blessed Bishop
Athanasius to write to Paulinus. But your excellency has on the spot those who are able to
tell you accurately what passed between the bishops in the reign of Jovian, and from them
I beseech you to get information.2814 I accuse no one; I pray that I may have love to all, and

“especially unto them who are of the household of faith;”2815 and therefore I congratulate
those who have received the letter from Rome. And, although it is a grand testimony in
their favour, I only hope it is true and confirmed by facts. But I shall never be able to persuade
myself on these grounds to ignore Meletius, or to forget the Church which is under him, or
to treat as small, and of little importance to the true religion, the questions which originated
the division. I shall never consent to give in, merely because somebody is very much elated
at receiving a letter from men.2816 Even if it had come down from heaven itself, but he does
not agree with the sound doctrine of the faith, I cannot look upon him as in communion
with the saints.</p>
<p>3. Consider well, my excellent friend, that the falsifiers of the truth, who have introduced
the Arian schism as an innovation on the sound faith of the Fathers, advance no other
reason for refusing to accept the pious opinion of the Fathers than the meaning of the homoousion
which they hold in their wickedness, and to the slander of the whole faith, alleging
our contention to be that the Son is consubstantial in hypostasis. If we give them any opportunity
by our being carried away by men who propound these sentiments and their like,
rather from simplicity than from malevolence, there is nothing to prevent our giving them
an unanswerable ground of argument against ourselves and confirming the heresy of those
whose one end is in all their utterances about the Church, not so much to establish their
own position as to calumniate mine. What more serious calumny could there be? What
better calculated to disturb the faith of the majority than that some of us could be shewn to
assert that there is one hypostasis of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost? We distinctly lay down
that there is a difference of Persons; but this statement was anticipated by Sabellius, who
affirms that God is one by hypostasis, but is described by Scripture in different Persons,
according to the requirements of each individual case; sometimes under the name of Father,
when there is occasion for this Person; sometimes under the name of Son when there is a
descent to human interests or any of the operations of the oeconomy;2817 and sometimes
under the Person of Spirit when the occasion demands such phraseology. If, then, any
among us are shewn to assert that Father, Son and Holy Ghost are one in substance,2818
while we maintain the three perfect Persons, how shall we escape giving clear and incontrovertible
proof of the truth of what is being asserted about us?</p>
<p>4. The non-identity of hypostasis and ousia is, I take it, suggested even by our western
brethren, where, from a suspicion of the inadequacy of their own language, they have given
the word ousia in the Greek, to the end that any possible difference of meaning might be

<pb n="718"/>
preserved in the clear and unconfounded distinction of terms. If you ask me to state shortly
my own view, I shall state that ousia has the same relation to hypostasis as the common has
to the particular. Every one of us both shares in existence by the common term of essence
(ousia) and by his own properties is such an one and such an one. In the same manner, in
the matter in question, the term ousia is common, like goodness, or Godhead, or any similar
attribute; while hypostasis is contemplated in the special property of Fatherhood, Sonship,
or the power to sanctify. If then they describe the Persons as being without hypostasis,2819
the statement is per se absurd; but if they concede that the Persons exist in real hypostasis,
as they acknowledge, let them so reckon them that the principle of the homoousion may be
preserved in the unity of the Godhead, and that the doctrine preached may be the recognition
of true religion, of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in the perfect and complete hypostasis of
each of the Persons named. Nevertheless, there is one point which I should like to have
pressed on your excellency, that you and all who like you care for the truth, and honour the
combatant in the cause of true religion, ought to wait for the lead to be taken in bringing
about this union and peace by the foremost authorities in the Church, whom I count as
pillars and foundations of the truth and of the Church, and reverence all the more because
they have been sent away for punishment, and have been exiled far from home. Keep
yourself, I implore you, clear of prejudice, that in you, whom God has given me as a staff
and support in all things, I may be able to find rest.2820</p>

respect, but what possible good could accrue to the cause by communication between a man

<p>To Meletius, bishop of Antioch.</p>
<p>Many other2824 journeys have taken me from home. I have been as far as Pisidia to
settle the matters concerning the brethren in Isauria in concert with the Pisidian bishops.
Thence I journeyed into Pontus, for Eustathius had caused no small disturbance at Dazimon,
and had caused there a considerable secession from our church. I even went as far as the
home of my brother Peter,2825 and, as this is not far from Neocæsarea, there was occasion
of considerable trouble to the Neocæsareans, and of much rudeness to myself. Some men
fled when no one was in pursuit. And I was supposed to be intruding uninvited, simply to

from the bad weather and my anxieties, I straightway received a letter from the East to tell
me that Paulinus had had certain letters from the West addressed to him, in acknowledgement
of a sort of higher claim; and that the Antiochene rebels were vastly elated by them,
and were next preparing a form of creed, and offering to make its terms a condition of
union with our Church. Besides all this it was reported to me that they had seduced to their
faction that most excellent man Terentius. I wrote to him at once as forcibly as I could, to

<p>To Amphilochius, the Canons.2826</p>
<p>On my return from a long journey (for I have been into Pontus on ecclesiastical business,
and to visit my relations) with my body weak and ill, and my spirits considerably broken, I
took your reverence’s letter into my hand. No sooner did I receive the tokens of that voice
which to me is of all voices the sweetest, and of that hand that I love so well, than I forgot
all my troubles. And if I was made so much more cheerful by the receipt of your letter, you
ought to be able to conjecture at what value I price your actual presence. May this be
granted me by the Holy One, whenever it may be convenient to you and you yourself send
me an invitation. And if you were to come to the house at Euphemias it would indeed be
pleasant for me to meet you, escaping from my vexations here, and hastening to your unfeigned
affection. Possibly also for other reasons I may be compelled to go as far as Nazianzus
by the sudden departure of the very God-beloved bishop Gregory. How or why this has
come to pass, so far I have no information.2827 The man about whom I had spoken to your
excellency, and whom you expected to be ready by this time, has, you must know, fallen ill
of a lingering disease, and is moreover now suffering from an affection of the eyes, arising
from his old complaint and from the illness which has now befallen him, and he is quite
unfit to do any work. I have no one else with me. It is consequently better, although the
matter was left by them to me, for some one to be put forward by them. And indeed one
cannot but think that the expressions were used merely as a necessary form, and that what
they really wished was what they originally requested, that the person selected for the leadership
should be one of themselves. If there is any one of the lately baptized,2828 whether

to his craving for retirement and his anxiety not to complicate the appointment of a successor to his father (who
died early in 374) in the see of Nazianzus. He found a refuge in the monastery of Thecla at the Isaurian Seleucia.

<note type="footnote">2828 The Ben. note appositely points out that any astonishment, such as expressed by Tillemont, at the consecration
of a neophyte, is quite out of place, in view of the exigencies of the times and the practice of postponing
baptism. St. Ambrose at Milan and Nectarius at Constantinople were not even “neophytes,” but were actually
unbaptized at the time of their appointment to their respective sees. “If there is any one among the lately baptized,”
argues the Ben. note, is tantamount to saying “If there is any one fit to be bishop.”</note>

<p>LI. As to the clergy, the Canons have enjoined without making any distinction that one
penalty is assigned for the lapsed,—ejection from the ministry, whether they be in orders2829
or remain in the ministry which is conferred without imposition of hands.</p>
<p>LII. The woman who has given birth to a child and abandoned it in the road, if she was
able to save it and neglected it, or thought by this means to hide her sin, or was moved by
some brutal and inhuman motive, is to be judged as in a case of murder. If, on the other
hand, she was unable to provide for it. and the child perish from exposure and want of the
necessities of life, the mother is to be pardoned.</p>
<p>LIII. The widowed slave is not guilty of a serious fall if she adopts a second marriage
under colour of rape. She is not on this ground open to accusation. It is rather the object
than the pretext which must be taken into account, but it is clear that she is exposed to the
punishment of digamy.2830</p>
<p>LIV. I know that I have already written to your reverence, so far as I can, on the distinctions
to be observed in cases of involuntary homicide,2831 and on this point I can say no
more. It rests with your intelligence to increase or lessen the severity of the punishment as
each individual case may require.</p>
<p>LV. Assailants of robbers, if they are outside, are prohibited from the communion of
the good thing.2832 If they are clerics they are degraded from their orders. For, it is said,
“All they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.”2833</p>
<note type="footnote">2829 ἐίτε ἐν βαθυῷ. This is understood by Balsamon and Zonaras to include Presbyters, Deacons, and subdeacons;
while the ministry conferred without imposition of hands refers to Readers, Singers, Sacristans, and
the like. Alexius Aristenus ranks Singers and Readers with the higher orders, and understands by the lower,
keepers of the sacred vessels, candle-lighters, and chancel door keepers. The Ben. note inclines to the latter view
on the ground that the word “remain” indicates a category where there was no advance to a higher grade, as
was the case with Readers and Singers.</note>

<p>LVI. The intentional homicide, who has afterwards repented, will be excommunicated
from the sacrament2834 for twenty years. The twenty years will be appointed for him as
follows: for four he ought to weep, standing outside the door of the house of prayer, beseeching
the faithful as they enter in to offer prayer in his behalf, and confessing his own sin.
After four years he will be admitted among the hearers, and during five years will go out
with them. During seven years he will go out with the kneelers,2835 praying. During four
years he will only stand with the faithful, and will not take part in the oblation. On the
completion of this period he will be admitted to participation of the sacrament.</p>
<p>LVII. The unintentional homicide will be excluded for ten years from the sacrament.
The ten years will be arranged as follows: For two years he will weep, for three years he will
continue among the hearers; for four he will be a kneeler; and for one he will only stand.
Then he will be admitted to the holy rites.</p>

he will be a weeper, and during five a hearer, during four a kneeler, and for two a slander

<note type="footnote">2840 On the earlier part of the canon the Ben. note says: “Balsamon, Zonaras, et Aristenus varia commentantur
in hunc canonem, sed a mente Basilii multum abludentia. Liquet enim hoc labiorum peccatum, cui remissior
poena infligitur ipsa actione, quam Basilius minime ignoscendam esse judicat, levius existimari debere. Simili
ratione sanctus Pater in cap. vi. Isaiæ n. 185, p. 516, labiorum peccata actionibus, ut leviora, opponit, ac prophetæ
delecta non ad actionem et operationem erupisse, sed labiis tenus constitisse observat. In eodem commentario n.
170, p. 501, impuritatis peccatum variis gradibus constare demonstrat, inter quos enumerat ῥήματα φθοροποιά,
verba ad corruptelam apta, ὁμιλίας μαχράς, longas confabulationes, quibus ad stuprum pervenitur. Ex his perspici
arbitror peccatum aliquod in hoc canone designari, quod ipsa actione levius sit: nedum ea suspicari liceat, quæ
Basilii interpretibus in mentem venerunt. Sed tamen cum dico Basilium in puniendis labiorum peccatis leniorem
esse, non quodlibet turpium sermonum genus, non immunda colloquia (quomodo enim presbyteris hoc vitio pollutis
honorem cathedræ reliquisset?), sed ejusmodi intelligenda est peccandi voluntas, quæ foras quidem aliquo sermone
prodit, sed tamen quominus in actum erumpat, subeunte meliori cogitatione, reprimitur. Quemadmodum enim
peccata, quæ sola cogitatione committuntur, idcirca leviora esse pronuntiat Basilius, comment. in Isaiam n. 115,
p. 459, et n. 243, p. 564, qui repressa est actionis turpitudo; ita hoc loco non quælibet labiorum peccata; non calumnias,
non blasphemias, sed ea tantum lenius tractat, quæ adeo gravia non erant, vel etiam ob declinatam actionis
turpitudinem, ut patet ex his verbis, seque eo usque peccasse confessus est, aliquid indulgentiæ merere videbantur.”
On the word καθαιρεθήσεται it is remarked: “In his canonibus quos de clericorum peccatis edidit Basilius, duo
videntur silentio prætermissa. Quæri enim possit 1o cur suspensionis poenam soli lectori ac ministro, sive subdiacono,
imponat, diaconis autem et presbyteris depositionem absque ulla prorsus exceptione infligat, nisi quod eis communionem
cum diaconis et presbyteris relinquit, si peccatum non ita grave fuerit. Erat tamen suspensionis poena in
ipsos presbyteros non inusitata, ut patet ex plurimis apostolicis canonibus, in quibus presbyteri ac etiam ipsi episcopi
segregantur, ac postea, si sese non emendaverint, deponuntur. Forte hæc reliquit Basilius episcopo dijudicanda
quemadmodum ejusdem arbitrio permittet in canonibus 74 et 84, ut poenitentiæ tempus imminuat, si bonus
evasint is qui peccavit. 2o Hæc etiam possit institui quæstio, utrumne in gravissimis quidem criminibus poenitentiam
publicam depositioni adjercerit. Adhibita ratio in Canone 3, cur aliquid discriminis clericos inter et laicos ponendum
sit, non solum ad gravia peccata, sed etiam ad gravissima pertinet. Ait enim æquum esse ut, cum laici post poenitentiam
in eumdem locum restituantur, clerici vero non restituantur, liberalius et mitius cum clericis agatur.
Nolebat ergo clericos lapsos quadruplicem poenitentiæ gradum percurrere. Sed quemadmodum lapso in fornicationem
diacono non statim communionem reddit, sed ejus conversionem et morum emendationem probandam</note>

<p>LXXI. Whoever is aware of the commission of any one of the aforementioned sins, and
is convicted without having confessed, shall be under punishment for the same space of

to weep all his life long, and is bound to remain in penitence, being deemed worthy of the

<p>LXXIV. If, however, each man who has committed the former sins is made good,

of loosing and binding2843 will not be deserving of condemnation, if he become less severe,

of penitential discipline, the outward act and performance of penance. From this it came to mean that public
acknowledgment of sin which formed so important a part of penitence. Irenæus (c. Hær. i. 13, § 5) speaks of
an adulterer who, having been converted, passed her whole life in a state of penitence (ἐξομολογουμένη, in exomologesi);

as is implied in the force of the tenses alike in the passages of St. Matthew cited and in St. John xx. 23, the recognition

three years to hearing alone, and while hearing the Scriptures and the instruction, let him
be expelled and not be admitted to prayer. Afterwards, if he has asked it with tears and has
fallen before the Lord with contrition of heart and great humiliation, let kneeling be accorded
to him during other three years. Thus, when he shall have worthily shown the fruits of repentance,
let him be received in the tenth year to the prayer of the faithful without oblation;
and after standing with the faithful in prayer for two years, then, and not till then, let him

of the Lord to the penalty of adultery. But it has been laid down as a canon by our Fathers
that such sinners should weep for a year, be hearers for two years, in kneeling for three years,
stand with the faithful in the seventh; and thus be deemed worthy of the oblation, if they
have repented with tears.2846</p>

<p>LXXX. On polygamy the Fathers are silent, as being brutish and altogether inhuman.
The sin seems to me worse than fornication. It is therefore reasonable that such sinners
should be subject to the canons; namely a year’s weeping, three years kneeling and then reception.2849</p>

tasted things unlawfully offered them in magic temples and so have broken their faith in
God. Let regulations be made in the case of these men in accordance with the canons laid
down by our Fathers.2850 Those who have endured grievous tortures and have been forced
to denial, through inability to sustain the anguish, may be excluded for three years, hearers
for two, kneelers for three, and so be received into communion. Those who have abandoned
their faith in God, laying hands on the tables of the demons and swearing heathen oaths,
without under going great violence, should be excluded for three years, hearers for two.
When they have prayed for three years as kneelers, and have stood other three with the
faithful in supplication, then let them be received into the communion of the good thing.</p>
<p>LXXXII. As to perjurers, if they have broken their oaths under violent compulsion,
they are under lighter penalties and may therefore be received after six years. If they break
their faith without compulsion, let them be weepers for two years, hearers for three, pray
as kneelers for five, during two be received into the communion of prayer, without oblation,
and so at last, after giving proof of due repentance, they shall be restored to the communion
of the body of Christ.</p>

marriage; trigamy being permitted (cf. Canon l. p. 240) though discouraged. The Ben. annotator dissents,
pointing out that in Canon iv. Basil calls trigamy, polygamy, and quoting Gregory of Nazianzus (Orat. 31) as
calling a third marriage παρανομία . Maran confirms this opinion by the comparison of the imposition on
polygamy of the same number of years of penance as are assigned to trigamy in Canon iv. “Theodore of Canterbury
a.d. 687 imposes a penance of seven years on trigamists but pronounces the marriages valid (Penitential,
lib. 1. c. xiv. § 3). Nicephorus of Constantinople, a.d. 814, suspends trigamists for five years. (Hard. Concil.
tom. iv. p. 1052.) Herard of Tours, a.d. 858 declares any greater number of wives than two to be unlawful (Cap
cxi. ibid. tom.v. p. 557). Leo the Wise, Emperor of Constantinople, was allowed to marry three wives without
public remonstrance, but was suspended from communion by the patriarch Nicholas when he married a fourth.
This led to a council being held at Constantinople, a.d. 920, which finally settled the Greek discipline on the
subject of third and fourth marriages. It ruled that the penalty for a fourth marriage was to be excommunication
and exclusion from the church; for a third marriage, if a man were forty years old, suspension for five years, and

<p>LXXXIII. Consulters of soothsayers and they who follow heathen customs, or bring

<p>LXXXIV. I write all this with a view to testing the fruits of repentance.2851 I do not
decide such matters absolutely by time, but I give heed to the manner of penance. If men
are in a state in which they find it hard to be weaned from their own ways and choose rather
to serve the pleasures of the flesh than to serve the Lord, and refuse to accept the Gospel
life, there is no common ground between me and them. In the midst of a disobedient and
gainsaying people I have been taught to hear the words “Save thy own soul.”2852 Do not
then let us consent to perish together with such sinners. Let us fear the awful judgment.
Let us keep before our eyes the terrible day of the retribution of the Lord. Let us not consent
to perish in other men’s sins, for if the terrors of the Lord have not taught us, if so great
calamities have not brought us to feel that it is because of our iniquity that the Lord has
abandoned us, and given us into the hands of barbarians, that the people have been led
captive before our foes and given over to dispersion, because the bearers of Christ’s name
have dared such deeds; if they have not known nor understood that it is for these reasons
that the wrath of God has come upon us, what common ground of argument have I with
them?</p>
<p>But we ought to testify to them day and night, alike in public and in private. Let us not
consent to be drawn away with them in their wickedness. Let us above all pray that we may
do them good, and rescue them from the snare of the evil one. If we cannot do this, let us
at all events do our best to save our own souls from everlasting damnation.</p>

<head>Letter CCXVIII.2853</head>
<p>To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.</p>
<p>Brother Ælianus has himself completed the business concerning which he came, and
has stood in need of no aid from me. I owe him, however, double thanks, both for bringing
me a letter from your reverence and for affording me an opportunity of writing to you. By
him, therefore, I salute your true and unfeigned love, and beseech you to pray for me more
than ever now, when I stand in such need of the aid of your prayers. My health has suffered
terribly from the journey to Pontus and my sickness is unendurable. One thing I have long
been anxious to make known to you. I do not mean to say that I have been so affected by
any other cause as to forget it, but now I wish to put you in mind to send some good man
into Lycia, to enquire who are of the right faith, for peradventure they ought not to be neglected,
if indeed the report is true, which has been brought to me by a pious traveller from
thence, that they have become altogether alienated from the opinion of the Asiani2854 and
wish to embrace communion with us. If any one is to go let him enquire at Corydala2855
for Alexander, the late monk, the bishop; at Limyra2856 for Diotimus, and at Myra2857 for
Tatianus, Polemo,2858 and Macarius presbyters; at Patara2859 for Eudemus,2860 the bishop;
at Telmessus2861 for Hilarius, the bishop; at Phelus for Lallianus, the bishop. Of these and
of more besides I have been informed that they are sound in the faith, and I have been
grateful to God that even any in the Asian region should be clear of the heretic’s pest. If,
then, it be possible, let us in the meanwhile make personal enquiry about them. When we
have obtained information I am for writing a letter, and am anxious to invite one of them
to meet me. God grant that all may go well with that Church at Iconium, which is so dear
to me. Through you I salute all the honourable clergy and all who are associated with your
reverence.</p>

<p>To the clergy of Samosata.</p>
<p>The Lord ordereth “all things in measure and weight,”2863 and brings on us the
temptations which do not exceed our power to endure them,2864 but tests all that fight in
the cause of true religion by affliction, not suffering them to be tempted above that they are
able to bear.2865 He gives tears to drink in great measure2866 to all who ought to show
whether in their affections they are preserving their gratitude to Him. Especially in His
dispensation concerning you has He shown His loving-kindness, not suffering such a persecution
to be brought on you by your enemies as might turn some of you aside, or cause
you to swerve from the faith of Christ. He has matched you with adversaries who are of
small importance and easy to be repelled, and has prepared the prize for your patience in
your victory over them. But the common enemy of our life, who, in his wiles, strives against
the goodness of God, because he has seen that, like a strong wall, you are despising attack
from without, has devised, as I hear, that there should arise among yourselves mutual offences
and quarrels. These indeed, at the outset, are insignificant and easy of cure; as time goes
on, however, they are increased by contention and are wont to result in irremediable mischief.
2867 I have, therefore, undertaken to exhort you by this letter. Had it been possible,
I would have come myself and supplicated you in person. But this is prevented by present
circumstances, and so, in lieu of supplication, I hold out this letter to you, that you may respect
my entreaty, may put a stop to your mutual rivalries, and may soon send me the good
news that all cause of offence among you is at an end.</p>
<p>2. I am very anxious that you should know that he is great before God who humbly
submits to his neighbour and submits to charges against himself, without having cause for
shame, even though they are not true, that he may bring the great blessing of peace upon
God’s Church.</p>
<p>I hope that there will arise among you a friendly rivalry, as to who shall first be worthy
of being called God’s son, after winning this rank for himself because of his being a peacemaker.
A letter has also been written to you by your very God-beloved bishop as to the
course which you ought to pursue. He will write again what it belongs to him to say. But

<head>Letter CCXX.2868</head>
<p>To the Beræans.2869</p>
<p>The Lord has given great consolation to all who are deprived of personal intercourse in
allowing them to communicate by letter. By this means, it is true, we cannot learn the express
image of the body, but we can learn the disposition of the very soul. Thus on the present
occasion, when I had received the letter of your reverences, I at the same moment recognised
you, and took your love towards me into my heart, and needed no long time to create intimacy
with you. The disposition shewn in your letter was quite enough to enkindle in me affection
for the beauty of your soul. And, besides your letter, excellent as it was, I had a yet
plainer proof of how things are with you from the amiability of the brethren who have been
the means of communication between us. The well-beloved and reverend presbyter Acacius,
has told me much in addition to what you have written, and has brought before my eyes
the conflict you have to keep up day by day, and the stoutness of the stand you are making
for the true religion. He has thus so moved my admiration, and roused in me so earnest a
desire of enjoying the good qualities in you, that I do pray the Lord that a time may come
when I may know you and yours by personal experience. He has told me of the exactitude
of those of you who are entrusted with the ministry of the altar, and moreover of the harmonious
agreement of all the people, and the generous character and genuine love towards
God of the magistrates and chief men of your city. I consequently congratulate the Church
on consisting of such members, and pray that spiritual peace may be given to you in yet
greater abundance, to the end that in quieter times you may derive enjoyment from your
labours in the day of affliction. For sufferings that are painful while they are being experienced
are naturally often remembered with pleasure. For the present I beseech you not to
faint. Do not despair because your troubles follow so closely one upon another. Your
crowns are near: the help of the Lord is near. Do not let all you have hitherto undergone
go for nothing; do not nullify a struggle which has been famous over all the world. Human
life is but of brief duration. “All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower
of the field.<gap reason=" omitted"/>The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand
for ever.”2870 Let us hold fast to the commandment that abideth, and despise the unreality
that passeth away. Many Churches have been cheered by your example. In calling new
champions into the field you have won for yourselves a great reward, though you knew it
not. The Giver of the prize is rich, and is able to reward you not unworthily for your brave
deeds.</p>

<p>You were previously known to me, my dear friends, by your far-famed piety, and by
the crown won by your confession in Christ. Peradventure one of you may ask in reply who
can have carried these tidings of us so far? The Lord Himself; for He puts His worshippers
like a lamp on a lamp-stand, and makes them shine throughout the whole world. Are not
winners in the games wont to be made famous by the prize of victory, and craftsmen by the
skilful design of their work? Shall the memory of these and others like them abide for ever
unforgotten, and shall not Christ’s worshippers concerning whom the Lord says Himself,
Them that honour me I will honour, be made famous and glorious by Him before all? Shall
He not display the brightness of their radiant splendour as He does the beams of the sun?
But I have been moved to greater longing for you by the letter which you have been good
enough to send me, a letter in which, above and beyond your former efforts on behalf of
the truth, you have been yet more lavish of your abounding and vigorous zeal for the true
faith. In all this I rejoice with you, and I pray with you that the God of the universe, Whose
is the struggle and the arena, and Who gives the crown, may fill you with enthusiasm, may
make your souls strong, and make your work such as to meet with His divine approval.</p>

<head>Letter CCXXII.2872</head>
<p>To the people of Chalcis.2873</p>
<p>The letter of your reverences came upon me in an hour of affliction like water poured
into the mouths of racehorses, inhaling dust with each eager breath at high noontide in the
middle of the course. Beset by trial after trial, I breathed again, at once cheered by your
words and invigorated by the thought of your struggles to meet that which is before me with
unflinching courage. For the conflagration which has devoured a great part of the East is
already advancing by slow degrees into our own neighbourhood, and after burning everything
round about us is trying to reach even the Churches in Cappadocia, already moved to tears
by the smoke that rises from the ruins of our neighbours’ homes.2874 The flames have almost
reached me. May the Lord divert them by the breath of His mouth, and stay this wicked
fire. Who is such a coward, so unmanly, so untried in the athlete’s struggles, as not to be
nerved to the fight by your cheers, and pray to be hailed victor at your side? You have been
the first to step into the arena of true religion; you have beaten off many an attack in bouts
with the heretics; you have borne the strong hot wind2875 of trial, both you who are leaders
of the Church, to whom has been the ministry of the altar, and every individual of the laity,
including those of higher rank. For this in you is specially admirable and worthy of all
praise, that you are all one in the Lord, some of you leaders in the march to what is good,
others willingly following. It is for this reason that you are too strong for the attack of your
assailants, and allow no hold to your antagonists in any one of your members, wherefore
day and night I pray the King of the ages to preserve the people in the integrity of their faith,
and for them to preserve the clergy, like a head unharmed at the top, exercising its own
watchful forethought for every portion of the body underneath. For while the eyes discharge
their functions, the hands can do their work as they ought, the feet can move without tripping,
and no part of the body is deprived of due care. I beseech you, then, to cling to one another,

<head>Letter CCXXIII.2876</head>
<p>Against Eustathius of Sebasteia.2877</p>
<p>1. There is a time to keep silence and a time to speak,2878 is the saying of the Preacher.
Time enough has been given to silence, and now the time has come to open my mouth for
the publication of the truth concerning matters that are, up to now, unknown. The illustrious
Job bore his calamities for a long time in silence, and ever showed his courage by holding
out under the most intolerable sufferings, but when he had struggled long enough in silence,
and had persisted in covering his anguish in the bottom of his heart, at last he opened his
mouth and uttered his well-known words.2879 In my own case this is now the third year of
my silence, and my boast has become like that of the Psalmist, “I was as a man that heareth
not and in whose mouth are no reproofs.”2880 Thus I shut up in the bottom of my heart
the pangs which I suffered on account of the calumnies directed against me, for calumny
humbles a man, and calumny makes a poor man giddy.2881 If, therefore, the mischief of
calumny is so great as to cast down even the perfect man from his height, for this is what
Scripture indicates by the word man, and by the poor man is meant he who lacks the great
doctrines, as is the view also of the prophet when he says, “These are poor, therefore they
shall not hear;<gap reason=" omitted"/>I will get me unto the great men,”2882 he means by poor those who are
lacking in understanding; and here, too, he plainly means those who are not yet furnished
in the inner man, and have not even come to the full measure of their age; it is these who
are said by the proverb to be made giddy and tossed about. Nevertheless I thought that I
ought to bear my troubles in silence, waiting for some indication to come out of them. I
did not even think that what was said against me proceeded from ill will; I thought it was
the result of ignorance of the truth. But now I see that hostility increases with time, and
that my slanderers are not sorry for what they said at the beginning, and do not take any
trouble to make amends for the past, but go on and on and rally themselves together to attain
their original object. This was to make my life miserable and to devise means for sullying
my reputation among the brethren. I, therefore, no longer see safety in silence. I have bethought
me of the words of Isaiah: “I have long time holden my peace, shall I always be still

and refrain myself? I have been patient like a travailing woman.”2883 God grant that I may
both receive the reward of silence, and gain some strength to confute my opponents, and
that thus, by confuting them, I may dry up the bitter torrent of falsehood that has gushed
out against me. So might I say, “My soul has passed over the torrent;”2884 and, “If it had
not been the Lord who was on our side when men rose up against us,<gap reason=" omitted"/>then they had
swallowed us up quick, the water had drowned us.”2885</p>
<p>2. Much time had I spent in vanity, and had wasted nearly all my youth in the vain labour
which I underwent in acquiring the wisdom made foolish by God. Then once upon a time,
like a man roused from deep sleep, I turned my eyes to the marvellous light of the truth of
the Gospel, and I perceived the uselessness of “the wisdom of the princes of this world, that
come to naught.”2886 I wept many tears over my miserable life and I prayed that guidance
might be vouchsafed me to admit me to the doctrines of true religion. First of all was I
minded to make some mending of my ways, long perverted as they were by my intimacy
with wicked men. Then I read the Gospel, and I saw there that a great means of reaching
perfection was the selling of one’s goods, the sharing them with the poor, the giving up of
all care for this life, and the refusal to allow the soul to be turned by any sympathy to things
of earth. And I prayed that I might find some one of the brethren who had chosen this way
of life, that with him I might cross life’s short2887 and troubled strait. And many did I find
in Alexandria, and many in the rest of Egypt, and others in Palestine, and in Coele Syria,
and in Mesopotamia. I admired their continence in living, and their endurance in toil; I
was amazed at their persistency in prayer, and at their triumphing over sleep; subdued by
no natural necessity, ever keeping their souls’ purpose high and free, in hunger, in thirst, in
cold, in nakedness,2888 they never yielded to the body; they were never willing to waste attention
on it; always, as though living in a flesh that was not theirs, they shewed in very deed
what it is to sojourn for a while in this life,2889 and what to have one’s citizenship and home
in heaven.2890 All this moved my admiration. I called these men’s lives blessed, in that they
did in deed shew that they “bear about in their body the dying of Jesus.”2891 And I prayed
that I, too, as far as in me lay, might imitate them.</p>

<p>3. So when I beheld certain men in my own country striving to copy their ways, I felt
that I had found a help to my own salvation, and I took the things seen for proof of things
unseen. And since the secrets in the hearts of each of us are unknown, I held lowliness of
dress to be a sufficient indication of lowliness of spirit; and there was enough to convince
me in the coarse cloak, the girdle, and the shoes of untanned hide.2892 And though many
were for withdrawing me from their society, I would not allow it, because I saw that they
put a life of endurance before a life of pleasure; and, because of the extraordinary excellence
of their lives, I became an eager supporter of them. And so it came about that I would not
hear of any fault being found with their doctrines, although many maintained that their
conceptions about God were erroneous, and that they had become disciples of the champion
of the present heresy, and were secretly propagating his teaching. But, as I had never at any
time heard these things with my own ears, I concluded that those who reported them were
calumniators. Then I was called to preside over the Church. Of the watchmen and spies,
who were given me under the pretence of assistance and loving communion, I say nothing,
lest I seem to injure my own cause by telling an incredible tale, or give believers an occasion
for hating their fellows, if I am believed. This had almost been my own case, had I not been
prevented by the mercy of God. For almost every one became an object of suspicion to me,
and smitten at heart as I was by wounds treacherously inflicted, I seemed to find nothing
in any man that I could trust. But so far there was, nevertheless, a kind of intimacy kept up
between us. Once and again we held discussions on doctrinal points. and apparently we
seemed to agree and keep together. But they began to find out that I made the same statements
concerning my faith in God which they had always heard from me. For, if other
things in me may move a sigh, this one boast at least I dare make in the Lord, that never for
one moment have I held erroneous conceptions about God, or entertained heterodox
opinions, which I have learnt later to change. The teaching about God which I had received
as a boy from my blessed mother and my grandmother Macrina, I have ever held with increased
conviction. On my coming to ripe years of reason I did not shift my opinions from
one to another, but carried out the principles delivered to me by my parents. Just as the
seed when it grows is first tiny and then gets bigger but always preserves its identity, not
changed in kind though gradually perfected in growth, so I reckon the same doctrine to
have grown in my case through gradually advancing stages. What I hold now has not replaced
what I held at the beginning. Let them search their own consciences. Let these men who
have now made me the common talk on the charge of false doctrine, and deafened all men’s
ears with the defamatory letters which they have written against me, so that I am compelled

thus to defend myself, ask themselves if they have ever heard anything from me, differing
from what I now say, and let them remember the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<p>4. I am charged with blasphemy against God. Yet it is impossible for me to be convicted
on the ground of any treatise concerning the Faith, which they urge against me, nor can I
be charged on the ground of the utterances which I have from time to time delivered by
word of mouth, without their being committed to writing, in the churches of God. Not a
single witness has been found to say that he has ever heard from me, when speaking in
private, anything contrary to true religion. If then I am not an unorthodox writer, if no
fault can be found with my preaching, if I do not lead astray those who converse with me
in my own home, on what ground am I being judged? But there is a new invention!
Somebody,2893 runs the charge, in Syria has written something inconsistent with true religion;
and twenty years or more ago you wrote him a letter: so you are an accomplice of the fellow,
and what is urged against him is urged against you. O truth-loving sir, I reply, you who
have been taught that lies are the offspring of the devil; what has proved to you that I wrote
that letter? You never sent; you never asked; you were never informed by me, who might
have told you the truth. But if the letter was mine, how do you know that the document
that has come into your hands now is of the same date as my letter? Who told you that it
is twenty years old? How do you know that it is a composition of the man to whom my
letter was sent? And if he was the composer, and I wrote to him, and my letter and his
composition belong to the same date, what proof is there that I accepted it in my judgment,
and that I hold those views?</p>
<p>5. Ask yourself. How often did you visit me in my monastery on the Iris, when my very
God-beloved brother Gregory was with me, following the same course of life as myself?
Did you ever hear anything of the kind? Was there any appearance of such a thing, small
or great? How many days did we spend in the opposite village, at my mother’s, living as
friend with friend, and discoursing together night and day? Did you ever find me holding
any opinion of the kind? And when we went together to visit the blessed Silvanus,2894 did
we not talk of these things on the way? And at Eusinoe,2895 when you were about to set out
with other bishops for Lampsacus,2896 was not our discourse about the faith? Were not
your shorthand writers at my side the whole time while I was dictating my objections to the

heresy? Were not your most faithful disciples there too? When I was visiting the brotherhood,
and passing the night with them in their prayers, continually speaking and hearing
of the things pertaining to God without dispute, was not the evidence which I gave of my
sentiments exact and definite? How came you then to reckon this rotten and slender suspicion
as of more importance than the experience of such a length of time?</p>
<p>What evidence of my frame of mind ought you to have preferred to your own? Has
there been the slightest want of harmony in my utterances about the faith at Chalcedon,
again and again at Heraclea, and at an earlier period in the suburb of Cæsarea? Are they
not all mutually consistent? I only except the increase in force of which I spoke just now,
resulting from advance, and which is not to be regarded as a change from worse to better,
but rather as a filling up of what was wanting in the addition of knowledge. How can you
fail to bear in mind that the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son, nor the son bear
the iniquity of the father, but each shall die in his own sin?2897 I have neither father nor
son slandered by you; I have had neither teacher nor disciple. But if the sins of the parents
must be made charges against their children, it is far fairer for the sins of Arius to be charged
against his disciples; and, whoever begat the heretic Aetius,2898 for the charges against the
son to be applied to the father. If on the other hand it is unjust for any one to be accused
for their sakes, it is far more unjust that I should be held responsible for the sake of men
with whom I have nothing to do, even if they were in every respect sinners, and something
worthy of condemnation has been written by them. I must be pardoned if I do not believe
all that is urged against them. since my own experience shows me how very easy it is for
accusers to slip into slander.</p>
<p>6. Even if they did come forward to accuse me, because they had been deceived, and
thought that I was associated with the writers of those words of Sabellius which they are
carrying about, they were guilty of unpardonable conduct in straightway attacking and
wounding me, when I had done them no wrong, before they had obtained plain proof. I
do not like to speak of myself as bound to them in the closest intimacy; or of them as being
evidently not led by the Holy Spirit, because of their cherishing false suspicions. Much
anxious thought must be taken, and many sleepless nights must be passed, and with many
tears must the truth be sought from God, by him who is on the point of cutting himself off
from a brother’s friendship. Even the rulers of this world, when they are on the point of
sentencing some evil doer to death, draw the veil aside,2899 and call in experts for the exam-

the common fault of humanity, and with many a sigh and many a lament for the stern necessity
of the case, proclaim before all the people that they are obeying the law from necessity,
and not passing sentence to gratify their own wishes.2900 How much greater care and diligence,
how much more counsel, ought to be taken by one who is on the point of breaking
off from long established friendship with a brother! In this case there is only a single letter
and that of doubtful genuineness. It would be quite impossible to argue that it is known by
the signature, for they possess not the original, but only a copy. They depend on one single
document and that an old one. It is now twenty years since anything has been written to
that person.2901 Of my opinions and conduct in the intervening time I can adduce no better
witnesses than the very men who attack and accuse me.</p>
<p>7. But the real reason of separation is not this letter. There is another cause of alienation.
I am ashamed to mention it; and I would have been for ever silent about it had not recent
events compelled me to publish all their mind for the sake of the good of the mass of the
people. Good men have thought that communion with me was a bar to the recovery of their
authority. Some have been influenced by the signature of a certain creed which I proposed
to them, not that I distrusted their sentiments, I confess, but because I wished to do away
with the suspicions which the more part of the brethren who agree with me entertained of
them. Accordingly, to avoid anything arising from that confession to prevent their being
accepted by the present authorities,2902 they have renounced communion with me. This
letter was devised by an after-thought as a pretext for the separation. A very plain proof of
what I say is, that after they had denounced me, and composed such complaints against me
as suited them, they sent round their letters in all directions before communicating with
me. Their letter was in the possession of others who had received it in the course of transmission
and who were on the point of sending it on seven days before it had reached my
hands. The idea was that it would be handed from one to another and so would be quickly
distributed over the whole country. This was reported to me at the time by those who were
giving me clear information of all their proceedings. But I determined to hold my tongue

<head>Letter CCXXIV.2903</head>
<p>To the presbyter Genethlius.</p>
<p>1. I have received your reverence’s letter and I am delighted at the title which you have
felicitously applied to the writing which they have composed in calling it “a writing of di-
vorcement.”2904 What defence the writers will be able to make before the tribunal of Christ,
where no excuse will avail, I am quite unable to conceive. After accusing me, violently
running me down, and telling tales in accordance not with the truth but with what they
wished to be true, they have assumed a great show of humility, and have accused me of
haughtiness for refusing to receive their envoys. They have written, as they have, what is
all—or nearly all—for I do not wish to exaggerate,—lies, in the endeavour to persuade men
rather than God, and to please men rather than God, with Whom nothing is more precious
than truth. Moreover into the letter written against me they have introduced heretical expressions,
and have concealed the author of the impiety, in order that most of the more
unsophisticated might be deceived by the calumny got up against me, and suppose the
portion introduced to be mine. For nothing is said by my ingenious slanderers as to the
name of the author of these vile doctrines, and it is left for the simple to suspect that these
inventions, if not their expression in writing, is due to me. Now that you know all this, I
exhort you not to be perturbed yourselves, and to calm the excitement of those who are
agitated. I say this although I know that it will not be easy for my defence to be received,
because I have been anticipated by the vile calumnies uttered against me by persons of influence.</p>
<p>2. Now as to the point that the writings going the round as mine are not mine at all,
the angry feeling felt against me so confuses their reason that they cannot see what is profitable.
Nevertheless, if the question were put to them by yourselves, I do think that they
would not reach such a pitch of obstinate perversity as to dare to utter the lie with their own
lips, and allege the document in question to be mine. And if it is not mine, why am I being
judged for other men’s writings? But they will urge that I am in communion with Apollinarius,
and cherish in my heart perverse doctrines of this kind. Let them be asked for proof.
If they are able to search into a man’s heart, let them say so; and do you admit the truth of
all that they say about everything. If on the other hand, they are trying to prove my being
in communion on plain and open grounds, let them produce either a canonical letter written
by me to him, or by him to me. Let them shew that I have held intercourse with his clergy,
or have ever received any one of them into the communion of prayer. If they adduce the
letter written now five and twenty years ago, written by layman to layman, and not even

<pb n="745"/>
this as I wrote it, but altered (God knows by whom), then recognise their unfairness. No
bishop is accused if, while he was a layman, he wrote something somewhat incautiously on
an indifferent matter; not anything concerning the Faith, but a mere word of friendly
greeting. Possibly even my opponents are known to have written to Jews and to Pagans,
without incurring any blame. Hitherto no one has ever been judged for any such conduct
as that on which I am being condemned by these strainers-out of gnats.2905 God, who
knows men’s hearts, knows that I never wrote these things, nor sanctioned them, but that
I anathematize all who hold the vile opinion of the confusion of the hypostases, on which
point the most impious heresy of Sabellius has been revived. And all the brethren who have
been personally acquainted with my insignificant self know it equally well. Let those very
men who now vehemently accuse me, search their own consciences, and they will own that
from my boyhood I have been far removed from any doctrine of the kind.</p>
<p>3. If any one enquires what my opinion is, he will learn it from the actual little document,
to which is appended their own autograph signature. This they wish to destroy, and they
are anxious to conceal their own change of position in slandering me. For they do not like
to own that they have repented of their subscription to the tract I gave them; while they
charge me with impiety from the idea that no one perceives that their disruption from me
is only a pretext, while in reality they have departed from that faith which they have over
and over again owned in writing, before many witnesses, and have lastly received and subscribed
when delivered to them by me. It is open to any one to read the signatures and to
learn the truth from the document itself. Their intention will be obvious, if, after reading
the subscription which they gave me, any one reads the creed which they gave Gelasius,2906
and observes what a vast difference there is between the two confessions. It would be better
for men who so easily shift their own position, not to examine other men’s motes but to
cast out the beam in their own eye.2907 I am making a more complete defence on every
point in another letter;2908 this will satisfy readers who want fuller assurance. Do you, now
that you have received this letter, put away all despondency, and confirm the love to me,2909
which makes me eagerly long for union with you. Verily it is a great sorrow to me, and a
pain in my heart that cannot be assuaged, if the slanders uttered against me so far prevail
as to chill your love and to alienate us from one another. Farewell.</p>

<head>Letter CCXXV.2910</head>
<p>To Demosthenes,2911 as from the synod of bishops.</p>
<p>I am always very thankful to God and to the emperor, under whose rule we live, when
I see the government of my country put into the hands of one who is not only a Christian,
but is moreover correct in life and a careful guardian of the laws according to which our life
in this world is ordered. I have had special reason for offering this gratitude to God and to
our God-beloved emperor on the occasion of your coming among us. I have been aware
that some of the enemies of peace have been about to stir your august tribunal against me,
and have been waiting to be summoned by your excellency that you might learn the truth
from me; if indeed your high wisdom condescends to consider the examination of ecclesiastical
matters to be within your province.2912 The tribunal overlooked me, but your excellency,
moved by the reproaches of Philochares, ordered my brother and fellow-minister
Gregory to be haled before your judgment seat. He obeyed your summons; how could he
do otherwise? But he was attacked by pain in the side, and at the same time, in consequence
of a chill, was attacked by his old kidney complaint. He has therefore been compelled, forcibly
detained by your soldiers as he was, to be conveyed to some quiet spot, where he could have
his maladies attended to, and get some comfort in his intolerable agony. Under these circumstances
we have combined to approach your lordship with the entreaty that you will
feel no anger at the postponement of the trial. The public interests have not in any way
suffered through our delay, nor have those of the Church been injured. If there is any
question of the wasteful expenditure of money, the treasurers of the Church funds are there,
ready to give an account to any one who likes, and to exhibit the injustice of the charges
advanced by men who have braved the careful hearing of the case before you. For they can
have no difficulty in making the truth clear to any one who seeks it from the actual writings
of the blessed bishop himself. If there is any other point of canonical order which requires
investigation, and your excellency deigns to undertake to hear and to judge it, it will be necessary
for us all to be present, because, if there has been a failure in any point of canonical

in 371, of whom the amusing story is told in Theodoret Hist. Ecc. iv. 16, on which see note. If he is, it is not
difficult to understand his looking with no friendly eye on Basil and his brother Gregory. He summoned a
synod to Ancyra in the close of 375 to examine into alleged irregularities in Gregory’s consecration and accusations
of embezzlement. The above letter is to apologize for Gregory’s failing to put in an appearance at Ancyra, and
to rebut the charges made against him. Tillemont would refer Letter xxxiii. to this period. Maran Vit. Bas. xii.

order, the responsibility lies with the consecrators and not with him who is forcibly compelled
to undertake the ministry. We therefore petition you to reserve the hearing of the case for
us in our own country, and not to compel us to travel beyond its borders, nor force us to a
meeting with bishops with whom we have not yet come to agreement on ecclesiastical
questions.2913 I beg you also to be merciful to my own old age and ill health. You will learn
by actual investigation, if it please God, that no canonical rule be it small or great was
omitted in the appointment of the bishop. I pray that under your administration unity and
peace may be brought about with my brethren; but so long as this does not exist it is difficult
for us even to meet, because many of our simpler brethren suffer from our mutual disputes.</p>

<p>To the ascetics under him.</p>
<p>It may be that the holy God will grant me the joy of a meeting with you, for I am ever
longing to see you and hear about you, because in no other thing do I find rest for my soul
than in your progress and perfection in the commandments of Christ. But so long as this
hope remains unrealized I feel bound to visit you through the instrumentality of our dear
and God-fearing brethren, and to address you, my beloved friends, by letter. Wherefore I
have sent my reverend and dear brother and fellow-worker in the Gospel, Meletius the
presbyter. He will tell you my yearning affection for you, and the anxiety of my soul, in
that, night and day, I beseech the Lord in your behalf, that I may have boldness in the day
of our Lord Jesus Christ through your salvation, and that when your work is tried by the
just judgment of God you may shine forth in the brightness of the saints. At the same time
the difficulties of the day cause me deep anxiety, for all Churches have been tossed to and
fro, and all souls are being sifted. Some have even opened their mouths without any reserve
against their fellow servants. Lies are boldly uttered, and the truth has been hidden. The
accused are being condemned without a trial, and the accusers are believed without evidence.
I had heard that many letters are being carried about against myself, stinging, gibbeting,
and attacking me for matters about which I have my defence ready for the tribunal of truth;
and I had intended to keep silence, as indeed I have done; for now for three years I have
been bearing the blows of calumny and the whips of accusation, content to think that I have
the Lord, Who knows all secrets, as witness of its falsehood. But I see now that many men
have silence as a corroboration of these slanders, and have formed the idea that my silence
was due, not to my longsuffering, but to my inability to open my lips in opposition to the
truth. For these reasons I have attempted to write to you, beseeching your love in Christ
not to accept these partial calumnies as true, because, as it is written, the law judges no man
unless it have heard and known his actions.2915</p>
<p>2. Nevertheless before a fair judge the facts themselves are a sufficient demonstration
of the truth. Wherefore, even if I be silent, you can look at events. The very men who are
now indicting me for heterodoxy have been seen openly numbered with the heretical faction.
The very accusers who condemn me for other men’s writings, are plainly contravening their
own confessions, given to me by them in writing. Look at the conduct of the exhibitors of
this audacity. It is their invariable custom to go over to the party in power, to trample on
their weaker friends, and to court the strong. The writers of those famous letters against
Eudoxius and all his faction, the senders of them to all the brotherhood, the protesters that
<note type="footnote">2914 Placed in 375.</note>
<note type="footnote">2915 cf. John vii. 51.</note>

<pb n="749"/>
they shun their communion as fatal to souls, and would not accept the votes given for their
deposition, because they were given by heretics, as they persuaded me then,—these very
men, completely forgetful of all this, have joined their faction.2916 No room for denial is
left them. They laid their mind bare when they embraced private communion with them
at Ancyra, when they had not yet been publicly received by them. Ask them, then, if Basilides,
who gave communion to Ecdicius, is now orthodox, why when returning from Dardania,
did they overthrow his altars in the territory of Gangra, and set up their own tables?2917
Why have they comparatively recently2918 attacked the churches of Amasea and Zela and
appointed presbyters and deacons there themselves? If they communicate with them as
orthodox, why do they attack them as heretical? If they hold them to be heretical, how is it
that they do not shun communion with them? Is it not, my honourable brethren, plain even
to the intelligence of a child, that it is always with a view to some personal advantage that
they endeavour to calumniate or to give support? So they have stood off from me, not because
I did not write in reply (which is alleged to be the main ground of offence), nor because I
did not receive the chorepiscopi whom they assert they sent. Those who are trumping up
the tale will render an account to the Lord. One man, Eustathius,2919 was sent and gave a
letter to the court of the vicar, and spent three days in the city. When he was on the point
of going home, it is said that he came to my house late in the evening, when I was asleep.
On hearing that I was asleep, he went away; he did not come near me on the next day, and
after thus going through the mere form of discharging his duty to me, departed. This is the
charge under which I am guilty. This is the sin against which these long-suffering people
have neglected to weigh the previous service wherein I served them in love. For this error
they have made their wrath against me so severe that they have caused me to be denounced
in all the Churches throughout the world—at least, that is, wherever they could.</p>
<note type="footnote">2916 The events referred to happened ten years before the date assigned for this letter, when the Semi-Arians
summoned Eudoxius to Lampsacus, and sentenced him to deprivation in his absence. (Soc. H.E. iv. 2–4; Soz.
H.E. vi. 7.) On the refusal of Valens to ratify the deposition and ultimate banishment of the Anti-Eudoxians,
Eustathius went to Rome to seek communion with Liberius, subscribed the Nicene Confession, and received
commendatory letters from Liberius to the Easterns. Soc. H.E. iv. 12. Eudoxius died in 370.</note>

<p>3. But of course this is not the real cause of our separation. It was when they found
that they would recommend themselves to Euzoius2920 if they were alienated from me, that
they devised these pretences. The object was to find some ground of recommendation with
the authorities for their attack upon me. Now they are beginning to run down even the
Nicene Creed, and nickname me Homoousiast, because in that creed the Only begotten Son
is said to be homoousios with God the Father. Not that one essence is divided into two
kindred parts; God forbid! This was not the meaning of that holy and God-beloved synod;
their meaning was that what the Father is in essence, such is the Son. And thus they themselves
have explained it to us, in the phrase Light of Light. Now it is the Nicene Creed,
brought by themselves from the west, which they presented to the Synod at Tyana, by which
they were received.2921 But they have an ingenious theory as to changes of this kind; they
use the words of the creed as physicians use a remedy for the particular moment, and substitute
now one and now another to suit particular diseases. The unsoundness of such a
sophism it is rather for you to consider than for me to prove. For “the Lord will give you
understanding”2922 to know what is the right doctrine, and what the crooked and perverse.
If indeed we are to subscribe one creed to-day and another tomorrow, and shift with the
seasons, then is the declaration false of him who said, “One Lord, one faith, one baptism.”2923
But if it is true, then “Let no man deceive you with [these] vain words.” They falsely accuse
me of introducing novelties about the Holy Spirit. Ask what the novelty is. I confess what
I have received, that the Paraclete is ranked with Father and Son, and not numbered with
created beings. We have made profession of our faith in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and
we are baptized in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Wherefore we never separate
the Spirit from conjunction2924 with the Father and the Son. For our mind, enlightened by
the Spirit, looks at the Son, and in Him, as in an image, beholds the Father. And I do not
invent names of myself, but call the Holy Ghost Paraclete; nor do I consent to destroy His
due glory. These are truly my doctrines. If any one wishes to accuse me for them, let him
accuse me; let my persecutor persecute me. Let him who believes in the slanders against
me be ready for the judgment. “The Lord is at hand.” “I am careful for nothing.”2925</p>
<p>4. If any one in Syria is writing, this is nothing to me. For it is said “By thy words thou
shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.”2926 Let my own words judge

me. Let no one condemn me for other men’s errors nor adduce letters written twenty years
ago in proof that I would allow communion to the writers of such things. Before these
things were written, and before any suspicion of this kind had been stirred against them, I
did write as layman to layman. I wrote nothing about the faith in any way like that which
they are now carrying about to calumniate me. I sent nothing but a mere greeting to return
a friendly communication, for I shun and anathematize as impious alike all who are affected
with the unsoundness of Sabellius, and all who maintain the opinions of Arius. If any one
says that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are the same, and supposes one thing under several
names, and one hypostasis described by three persons, I rank such an one as belonging to
the faction of the Jews.2927 Similarly, if any one says that the Son is in essence unlike the
Father, or degrades the Holy Ghost into a creature, I anathematize him, and say that he is
coming near to the heathen error. But it is impossible for the mouths of my accusers to be
restrained by my letter; rather is it likely that they are being irritated at my defence, and are
getting up new and more violent attacks against me. But it is not difficult for your ears to
be guarded. Wherefore, as far as in you lies, do as I bid you. Keep your heart clear and
unprejudiced by their calumnies; and insist on my rendering an account to meet the charges
laid against me. If you find that truth is on my side do not yield to lies; if on the other hand
you feel that I am feeble in defending myself, then believe my accusers as being worthy of
credit. They pass sleepless nights to do me mischief. I do not ask this of you. They are
taking to a commercial career, and turning their slanders against me into a means of profit.
I implore you on the other hand to stop at home, and to lead a decorous life, quietly doing
Christ’s work.2928 I advise you to avoid communication with them, for it always tends to
the perversion of their hearers. I say this that you may keep your affection for the uncontaminated,
may preserve the faith of the Fathers in its integrity, and may appear approved
before the Lord as friends of the truth.</p>

<head>Letter CCXXVII.2929</head>
<p>Consolatory, to the clergy of Colonia.2930</p>
<p>What is so goodly and honourable before God and men as perfect love, which, as we
are told by the wise teacher, is the fulfilling of the law?2931 I therefore approve of your warm
affection for your bishop, for, as to an affectionate son the loss of a good father is unendurable,
so Christ’s Church cannot bear the departure of a pastor and teacher. Thus, in your
exceeding affection for your bishop, you are giving proof of a good and noble disposition.
But this your good will towards your spiritual father is to be approved so long as it is shewn
in reason and moderation; once let it begin to overstep this line, and it is no longer descrying
of the same commendation. In the case of your very God-beloved brother, our fellowminister
Euphronius, good government has been shewn by those to whom has been committed
the administration of the Church; they have acted as the occasion compelled them,
to the gain alike of the Church to which he has been removed and of yourselves from whom
he has been taken. Do not look at this as merely of man’s ordaining, nor as having been
originated by the calculations of men who regard earthly things. Believe that those to whom
the anxious care of the Churches belongs have acted, as they have, with the aid of the Holy
Spirit; impress this inception of the proceedings on your hearts and do your best to perfect
it. Accept quietly and thankfully what has happened, with the conviction that all, who refuse
to accept what is ordered in God’s Churches by the Churches, are resisting the ordinance
of God.2932 Do not enter into a dispute with your Mother Church at Nicopolis. Do not
exasperate yourselves against those who have taken the anxious responsibility of your souls.
In the firm establishment of things at Nicopolis your part in them may also be preserved;
but if some disturbance affects them, though you have protectors beyond number, with the
head the heart will be destroyed. It is like men who live on the riverside; when they see some
one far up the stream making a strong dam against the current, they know that, in stopping
the inrush of the current, he is providing for their safety. Just so those who have now undertaken
the weight of the care of the Churches, by protecting the rest, are proving for your
own security. You will be sheltered from every storm, while others have to bear the brunt
of the attack. But you ought also to consider this; he has not cast you off; he has taken others
into his charge. I am not so invidious as to compel the man, who is able to give a share of

A man who puts a fence round a spring, and spoils the outpour of the waters, is not free
from the disease of envy, and it is just the same with him who tries to prevent the further
flow of abundant teaching. Let him have some care for Nicopolis too, and let your interests
be added to his anxieties there. He has received an addition of labour, but there is no diminution
in his diligence on your behalf. I am really distressed at one thing that you have
said, which seems to me quite extravagant, namely, that if you cannot obtain your object,
you will betake yourselves to the tribunals, and put the matter into the hands of men, the
great object of whose prayers is the overthrow of the Churches. Take heed lest men, carried
away by unwise passions, persuade you, to your hurt, to put in any plea before the courts,
and so some catastrophe may ensue, and the weight of the result fall upon the heads of those
who have occasioned it. Take my advice. It is offered you in a fatherly spirit. Consent to
the arrangement with the very God-beloved bishops, which has been made in accordance
with God’s will. Wait for my arrival. When I am with you, with God’s help, I will give you
in person all the exhortations which it has been impossible for me to express in my letter,
and will do my utmost to give you all possible consolation, not by word but in deed.</p>

<p>To the magistrates of Colonia.</p>
<p>I have received your lordships’ letter, and offered thanks to God most holy, that you,
occupied as you are with affairs of state, should not put those of the Church in the second
place. I am grateful to think that every one of you has shewn anxiety as though he were
acting in his own private interest, nay, in defence of his own life, and that you have written
to me in your distress at the removal of your very God-beloved bishop Euphronius. Nico-
polis has not really stolen him from you; were she pleading her cause before a judge she
might say that she was recovering what is her own. If honourably treated she will tell you,
as becomes an affectionate mother, that she will share with you the Father who will give a
portion of his grace to each of you: he will not suffer the one to be in any way harmed by
the invasion of their adversaries, and at the same time will not deprive you, the other, of the
care to which you have been accustomed. Bethink you then of the emergency of the time;
apply your best intelligence to understand how good government necessitates a certain
course of action; and then pardon the bishops who have adopted this course for the establishment
of the Churches of our Lord Jesus Christ. Suggest to yourselves what is becoming
you. Your own intelligence needs no instruction. You know how to adopt the counsels of
those who love you. It is only natural that you should be unaware of many of the questions
that are being agitated, because of our being situated far away in Armenia; but we who are
in the midst of affairs and have our ears dinned every day on all sides with news of Churches
that are being overthrown, are in deep anxiety lest the common enemy, in envy at the protracted
peace of our life, should be able to sow his tares in your ground too, and Armenia,
as well as other places, be given over to our adversaries to devour. For the present be still,
as not refusing to allow your neighbours to share with you the use of a goodly vessel. Ere
long, if the Lord allow me to come to you, you shall, if it seem necessary to you, receive yet
greater consolation for what has come to pass.</p>

<head>Letter CCXXIX.2934</head>
<p>To the clergy of Nicopolis.</p>
<p>I am sure that a work done by one or two pious men is not done without the cooperation
of the Holy Spirit. For when nothing merely human is put before us, when holy men are
moved to action with no thought of their own personal gratification, and with the sole object
of pleasing God, it is plain that it is the Lord Who is directing their hearts. When spirituallyminded
men take the lead in counsel, and the Lord’s people follow them with consentient
hearts, there can be no doubt that their decisions are arrived at with the participation of our
Lord Jesus Christ, Who poured out His blood for the Churches’ sake. You are therefore
right in supposing that our very God-beloved brother and fellow minister Poemenius,2935
who arrived among you at an opportune moment, and discovered this means of consoling
you, has been divinely moved. I not only praise his discovery of the right course to take; I
much admire the firmness with which, without allowing any delay to intervene, so as to
slacken the energy of the petitioners, or to give the opposite party an opportunity of taking
precautions, and to set in motion the counterplots of secret foes, he at once crowned his
happy course with a successful conclusion. The Lord of His especial grace keep him and
his, so that the Church, as becomes her, may remain in a succession in no way degenerate,
and not give place to the evil one, who now, if ever, is vexed at the firm establishment of the
Churches.</p>
<p>2. I have also written at length to exhort our brethren at Colonia. You, moreover, are
bound rather to put up with their frame of mind than to increase their irritation, as though
you despised them for their insignificance, or provoked them to a quarrel by your contempt.
It is only natural for disputants to act without due counsel, and to manage their own affairs
ill with the object of vexing their opponents. And no one is so small as not to be now able
to give an occasion, to those who want an occasion, for great troubles. I do not speak at
random. I speak from my own experience of my own troubles. From these may God keep
you in answer to your prayers. Pray also for me, that I may have a successful journey, and,
on my arrival, may share your joy in your present pastor, and with you may find consolation
at the departure of our common father.2936</p>

<p>To the magistrates of Nicopolis.</p>
<p>The government of the Churches is carried on by those to whom the chief offices in
them have been entrusted, but their hands are strengthened by the laity. The measures
which lay with the God-beloved bishops have been taken. The rest concerns you, if you
deign to accord a hearty reception to the bishop who has been given you, and to make a
vigorous resistance to attacks from outside. For nothing is so likely to cause discouragement
to all, whether rulers or the rest who envy your peaceful position, as agreement in affection
to the appointed bishop, and firmness in maintaining your ground. They are likely to despair
of every evil attempt, if they see that their counsels are accepted neither by clergy nor by
laity. Bring it about then that your own sentiments as to the right2938 may be shared by all
the city, and so speak to the citizens, and to all the inhabitants of the district, in confirmation
of their good sentiments, that the genuineness of your love to God may be everywhere
known. I trust that it may be permitted me one day to visit and inspect a Church which is
the nursing mother of true religion, honoured by me as a metropolis of orthodoxy, because
it has from of old been under the government of men right honourable and the elect of God,
who have held fast to “the faithful word as we have been taught.”2939 You have approved
him who has just been appointed as worthy of these predecessors, and I have agreed. May
you be preserved by God’s grace. May He scatter the evil counsels of our enemies, and fix
in your souls strength and constancy to preserve what has been rightly determined on.</p>

<p>To Amphilochius, bishop of Iconium.</p>
<p>I find few opportunities of writing to your reverence, and this causes me no little trouble.
It is just the same as if, when it was in my power to see you and enjoy your society very often,
I did so but seldom. But it is impossible for me to write to you because so few travel hence
to you, otherwise there is no reason why my letter should not be a kind of journal of my
life, to tell you, my dear friend, everything that happens to me day by day. It is a comfort
to me to tell you my affairs, and I know that you care for nothing more than for what concerns
me. Now, however, Elpidius2941 is going home to his own master, to refute the calumnies
falsely got up against him by certain enemies, and he has asked me for a letter. I therefore
salute your reverence by him and commend to you a man who deserves your protection, at
once for the sake of justice and for my own sake. Although I could say nothing else in his
favour, yet, because he has made it of very great importance to be the bearer of my letter,
reckon him among our friends, and remember me and pray for the Church.</p>
<p>You must know that my very God-beloved brother is in exile, for he could not endure
the annoyance caused him by shameless persons.2942 Doara2943 is in a state of agitation,
for the fat sea monster2944 is throwing everything into confusion. My enemies, as I am informed
by those who know, are plotting against me at court. But hitherto the hand of the
Lord has been over me. Only pray that I be not abandoned in the end. My brother is taking
things quietly. Doara has received the old muleteer.2945 She can do no more. The Lord
will scatter the counsels of my enemies. The one cure for all my troubles present and to
come is to set eyes on you. If you possibly can, while I am still alive, do come to see me.

And when symbols of the feast are brought, what can I call it but a feast of feasts, as the old
law used to speak of Sabbath of Sabbaths? I thank the Lord that you are quite well, and that
you have celebrated the commemoration of the economy of salvation2948 in a Church at
peace. I have been disturbed by some troubles; and have not been without distress from
the fact of my God-beloved brother being in exile. Pray for him that God may one day grant
him to see his Church healed from the wounds of heretical bites. Do come to see me while
I am yet upon this earth. Act in accordance with your own wishes and with my most earnest
prayers. I may be allowed to be astonished at the meaning of your blessings, inasmuch as
you have mysteriously wished me a vigorous old age. By your lamps2949 you rouse me to
nightly toil; and by your sweet meats you seem to pledge yourself securely that all my body
is in good case. But there is no munching for me at my time of life, for my teeth have long

<head>Letter CCXXXIII.2950</head>
<p>To Amphilochius, in reply to certain questions.</p>
<p>I. I know that I have myself heard of this, and I am aware of the constitution of mankind.
What shall I say? The mind is a wonderful thing, and therein we possess that which is after
the image of the Creator. And the operation of the mind is wonderful; in that, in its perpetual
motion, it frequently forms imaginations about things non-existent as though they were
existent, and is frequently carried straight to the truth. But there are in it two faculties; in
accordance with the view of us who believe in God, the one evil, that of the dæmons which
draws us on to their own apostasy; and the divine and the good, which brings us to the
likeness of God. When, therefore, the mind remains alone and unaided, it contemplates
small things, commensurate with itself. When it yields to those who deceive it, it nullifies
its proper judgment, and is concerned with monstrous fancies. Then it considers wood to
be no longer wood, but a god; then it looks on gold no longer as money, but as an object of
worship.2951 If on the other hand it assents to its diviner part, and accepts the boons of the
Spirit, then, so far as its nature admits, it becomes perceptive of the divine. There are, as it
were, three conditions of life, and three operations of the mind. Our ways may be wicked,
and the movements of our mind wicked; such as adulteries, thefts, idolatries, slanders, strife,
passion, sedition, vain-glory, and all that the apostle Paul enumerates among the works of
the flesh.2952 Or the soul’s operation is, as it were, in a mean, and has nothing about it either
damnable or laudable, as the perception of such mechanical crafts as we commonly speak
of as indifferent, and, of their own character, inclining neither towards virtue nor towards
vice. For what vice is there in the craft of the helmsman or the physician? Neither are these
operations in themselves virtues, but they incline in one direction or the other in accordance
with the will of those who use them. But the mind which is impregnated with the Godhead
of the Spirit is at once capable of viewing great objects; it beholds the divine beauty, though
only so far as grace imparts and its nature receives.</p>
<p>2. Let them dismiss, therefore, these questions of dialectics and examine the truth, not
with mischievous exactness but with reverence. The judgment of our mind is given us for
the understanding of the truth. Now our God is the very truth.2953 So the primary function
of our mind is to know one God, but to know Him so far as the infinitely great can be known
by the very small. When our eyes are first brought to the perception of visible objects, all

visible objects are not at once brought into sight. The hemisphere of heaven is not beheld
with one glance, but we are surrounded by a certain appearance, though in reality many
things, not to say all things, in it are unperceived;—the nature of the stars, their greatness,
their distances, their movements, their conjunctions, their intervals, their other conditions,
the actual essence of the firmament, the distance of depth from the concave circumference
to the convex surface. Nevertheless, no one would allege the heaven to be invisible because
of what is unknown; it would be said to be visible on account of our limited perception of
it. It is just the same in the case of God. If the mind has been injured by devils it will be
guilty of idolatry, or will be perverted to some other form of impiety. But if it has yielded
to the aid of the Spirit, it will have understanding of the truth, and will know God. But it
will know Him, as the Apostle says, in part; and in the life to come more perfectly. For
“when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.”2954 The
judgment of the mind is, therefore, good and given us for a good end—the perception of
God; but it operates only so far as it can.</p>

<head>Letter CCXXXIV.2955</head>
<p>To the same, in answer to another question.</p>
<p>Do you worship what you know or what you do not know? If I answer, I worship what
I know, they immediately reply, What is the essence of the object of worship? Then, if I
confess that I am ignorant of the essence, they turn on me again and say, So you worship
you know not what. I answer that the word to know has many meanings. We say that we
know the greatness of God, His power, His wisdom, His goodness, His providence over us,
and the justness of His judgment; but not His very essence. The question is, therefore, only
put for the sake of dispute. For he who denies that he knows the essence does not confess
himself to be ignorant of God, because our idea of God is gathered from all the attributes
which I have enumerated. But God, he says, is simple, and whatever attribute of Him you
have reckoned as knowable is of His essence. But the absurdities involved in this sophism
are innumerable. When all these high attributes have been enumerated, are they all names
of one essence? And is there the same mutual force in His awfulness and His loving-kindness,
His justice and His creative power, His providence and His foreknowledge, and His bestowal
of rewards and punishments, His majesty and His providence? In mentioning any one of
these do we declare His essence? If they say, yes, let them not ask if we know the essence of
God, but let them enquire of us whether we know God to be awful, or just, or merciful.
These we confess that we know. If they say that essence is something distinct, let them not
put us in the wrong on the score of simplicity. For they confess themselves that there is a
distinction between the essence and each one of the attributes enumerated. The operations
are various, and the essence simple, but we say that we know our God from His operations,
but do not undertake to approach near to His essence. His operations come down to us,
but His essence remains beyond our reach.</p>
<p>2. But, it is replied, if you are ignorant of the essence, you are ignorant of Himself.
Retort, If you say that you know His essence, you are ignorant of Himself. A man who has
been bitten by a mad dog, and sees a dog in a dish, does not really see any more than is seen
by people in good health; he is to be pitied because he thinks he sees what he does not see.
Do not then admire him for his announcement, but pity him for his insanity. Recognise
that the voice is the voice of mockers, when they say, if you are ignorant of the essence of
God, you worship what you do not know. I do know that He exists; what His essence is, I
look at as beyond intelligence. How then am I saved? Through faith. It is faith sufficient
to know that God exists, without knowing what He is; and “He is a rewarder of them that
seek Him.”2956 So knowledge of the divine essence involves perception of His incompre-
<note type="footnote">2955 Placed in 376.</note>
<note type="footnote">2956 Heb. xi. 6.</note>

<pb n="763"/>
hensibility, and the object of our worship is not that of which we comprehend the essence,
but of which we comprehend that the essence exists.</p>
<p>3. And the following counter question may also be put to them. “No man hath seen
God at any time, the Only-begotten which is in the bosom hath declared him.”2957 What
of the Father did the Only-begotten Son declare? His essence or His power? If His power,
we know so much as He declared to us. If His essence, tell me where He said that His essence
was the being unbegotten?2958 When did Abraham worship? Was it not when he believed?
And when did he believe? Was it not when he was called? Where in this place is there any
testimony in Scripture to Abraham’s comprehending? When did the disciples worship
Him? Was it not when they saw creation subject to Him? It was from the obedience of sea
and winds to Him that they recognised His Godhead. Therefore the knowledge came from
the operations, and the worship from the knowledge. “Believest thou that I am able to do
this?” “I believe, Lord;”2959 and he worshipped Him. So worship follows faith, and faith is
confirmed by power. But if you say that the believer also knows, he knows from what he
believes; and vice versa he believes from what he knows. We know God from His power.
We, therefore, believe in Him who is known, and we worship Him who is believed in.</p>

<p>To the same, in answer to another question.</p>
<p>1. Which is first in order, knowledge or faith? I reply that generally, in the case of disciples,
faith precedes knowledge. But, in our teaching, if any one asserts knowledge to come
before faith, I make no objection; understanding knowledge so far as is within the bounds
of human comprehension. In our lessons we must first believe that the letter a is said to us;
then we learn the characters and their pronunciation, and last of all we get the distinct idea
of the force of the letter. But in our belief about God, first comes the idea that God is. This
we gather from His works. For, as we perceive His wisdom, His goodness, and all His invisible
things from the creation of the world,2961 so we know Him. So, too, we accept Him as
our Lord. For since God is the Creator of the whole world, and we are a part of the world,
God is our Creator. This knowledge is followed by faith, and this faith by worship.</p>
<p>2. But the word knowledge has many meanings, and so those who make sport of simpler
minds, and like to make themselves remarkable by astounding statements (just like jugglers
who get the balls out of sight before men’s very eyes), hastily included everything in their
general enquiry. Knowledge, I say, has a very wide application, and knowledge may be got
of what a thing is, by number, by bulk, by force, by its mode of existence, by the period of
its generation, by its essence. When then our opponents include the whole in their question,
if they catch us in the confession that we know, they straightway demand from us knowledge
of the essence; if, on the contrary, they see us cautious as to making any assertion on the
subject, they affix on us the stigma of impiety. I, however, confess that I know what is
knowable of God, and that I know what it is which is beyond my comprehension.2962 So
if you ask me if I know what sand is, and I reply that I do, you will obviously be slandering
me, if you straightway ask me the number of the sand; inasmuch as your first enquiry bore
only on the form of sand, while your second unfair objection bore upon its number. The
quibble is just as though any one were to say, Do you know Timothy? Oh, if you know
Timothy you know his nature. Since you have acknowledged that you know Timothy, give
me an account of Timothy’s nature. Yes; but I at the same time both know and do not know
Timothy, though not in the same way and in the same degree. It is not that I do not know
in the same way in which I do know; but I know in one way and am ignorant in one way.
I know him according to his form and other properties; but I am ignorant of his essence.
Indeed, in this way too, I both know, and am ignorant of, myself. I know indeed who I am,
but, so far as I am ignorant of my essence I do not know myself.</p>

<p>3. Let them tell me in what sense Paul says, “Now we know in part”;2963 do we know
His essence in part, as knowing parts of His essence? No. This is absurd; for God is without
parts. But do we know the whole essence? How then “When that which is perfect is come,
then that which is in part shall be done away.”2964 Why are idolaters found fault with? Is
it not because they knew God and did not honour Him as God? Why are the “foolish
Galatians”2965 reproached by Paul in the words, “After that ye have known God, or rather
are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements?”2966 How was
God known in Jewry? Was it because in Jewry it was known what His essence is? “The ox,”
it is said, “knoweth his owner.”2967 According to your argument the ox knows his lord’s
essence. “And the ass his master’s crib.”2968 So the ass knows the essence of the crib, but
“Israel doth not know me.” So, according to you, Israel is found fault with for not knowing
what the essence of God is. “Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known
thee,”2969 that is, who have not comprehended thy essence. But, I repeat, knowledge is
manifold—it involves perception of our Creator, recognition of His wonderful works, observance
of His commandments and intimate communion with Him. All this they thrust
on one side and force knowledge into one single meaning, the contemplation of God’s essence.
Thou shalt put them, it is said, before the testimony and I shall be known of thee
thence.2970 Is the term, “I shall be known of thee,” instead of, “I will reveal my essence”?
“The Lord knoweth them that are his.”2971 Does He know the essence of them that are His,
but is ignorant of the essence of those who disobey Him? “Adam knew his wife.”2972 Did
he know her essence? It is said of Rebekah “She was a virgin, neither had any man known
her,”2973 and “How shall this be seeing I know not a man?”2974 Did no man know Rebekah’s
essence? Does Mary mean “I do not know the essence of any man”? Is it not the custom

<head>Letter CCXXXVI.2975</head>
<p>To the same Amphilochius.</p>
<p>1. Enquiry has already frequently been made concerning the saying of the gospels as
to our Lord Jesus Christ’s ignorance of the day and of the hour of the end;2976 an objection
constantly put forward by the Anomoeans to the destruction of the glory of the Only-Begotten,
in order to show Him to be unlike in essence and subordinate in dignity; inasmuch as,
if He know not all things, He cannot possess the same nature nor be regarded as of one
likeness with Him, who by His own prescience and faculty of forecasting the future has
knowledge coextensive with the universe. This question has now been proposed to me by
your intelligence as a new one. I can give in reply the answer which I heard from our fathers
when I was a boy, and which on account of my love for what is good, I have received without
question. I do not expect that it can undo the shamelessness of them that fight against
Christ, for where is the reasoning strong enough to stand their attack? It may, however,
suffice to convince all that love the Lord, and in whom the previous assurance supplied
them by faith is stronger than any demonstration of reason.</p>
<p>Now “no man” seems to be a general expression, so that not even one person is excepted
by it, but this is not its use in Scripture, as I have observed in the passage “there is none good
but one, that is, God.”2977 For even in this passage the Son does not so speak to the exclusion
of Himself from the good nature. But, since the Father is the first good, we believe the words
“no man” to have been uttered with the understood addition of “first.”2978 So with the
passage “No man knoweth the Son but the Father;”2979 even here there is no charge of ignorance
against the Spirit, but only a testimony that knowledge of His own nature naturally
belongs to the Father first. Thus also we understand “No man knoweth,”2980 to refer to the
Father the first knowledge of things, both present and to be, and generally to exhibit to men
the first cause. Otherwise how can this passage fall in with the rest of the evidence of
Scripture, or agree with the common notions of us who believe that the Only-Begotten is
the image of the invisible God, and image not of the bodily figure, but of the very Godhead

and of the mighty qualities attributed to the essence of God, image of power, image of wisdom,
as Christ is called “the power of God and the wisdom of God”?2981 Now of wisdom
knowledge is plainly a part; and if in any part He falls short, He is not an image of the whole;
and how can we understand the Father not to have shewn that day and that hour—the
smallest portion of the ages—to Him through Whom He made the ages? How can the
Creator of the universe fall short of the knowledge of the smallest portion of the things
created by Him? How can He who says, when the end is near, that such and such signs shall
appear in heaven and in earth, be ignorant of the end itself? When He says, “The end is not
yet.”2982 He makes a definite statement, as though with knowledge and not in doubt. Then
further, it is plain to the fair enquirer that our Lord says many things to men, in the character
of man; as for instance, “give me to drink”2983 is a saying of our Lord, expressive of His
bodily necessity; and yet the asker was not soulless flesh, but Godhead using flesh endued
with soul.2984 So in the present instance no one will be carried beyond the bounds of the
interpretation of true religion, who understands the ignorance of him who had received all
things according to the oeconomy,2985 and was advancing with God and man in favour and
wisdom.2986</p>
<p>2. It would be worthy of your diligence to set the phrases of the Gospel side by side,
and compare together those of Matthew and those of Mark, for these two alone are found
in concurrence in this passage. The wording of Matthew is “of that day and hour knoweth
no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.”2987 That of Mark runs, “But of
that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the
Son, but the Father.”2988 What is noticeable in these passages is this; that Matthew says
nothing about the ignorance of the Son, and seems to agree with Mark as to sense in saying
“but my Father only.” Now I understand the word “only” to have been used in contradistinction
to the angels, but that the Son is not included with His own servants in ignorance.</p>

<p>He could not say what is false Who said “All things that the Father hath are Mine,”2989
but one of the things which the Father hath is knowledge of that day and of that hour. In
the passage in Matthew, then, the Lord made no mention of His own Person, as a matter
beyond controversy, and said that the angels knew not and that His Father alone knew, tacitly
asserting the knowledge of His Father to be His own knowledge too, because of what He
had said elsewhere, “as the Father knoweth me even so know I the Father,”2990 and if the
Father has complete knowledge of the Son, nothing excepted, so that He knows all knowledge
to dwell in Him, He will clearly be known as fully by the Son with all His inherent wisdom
and all His knowledge of things to come. This modification, I think, may be given to the
words of Matthew, “but my Father only.” Now as to the words of Mark, who appears distinctly
to exclude the Son from the knowledge, my opinion is this. No man knoweth, neither
the angels of God; nor yet the Son would have known unless the Father had known: that
is, the cause of the Son’s knowing comes from the Father. To a fair hearer there is no violence
in this interpretation, because the word “only” is not added as it is in Matthew. Mark’s
sense, then, is as follows: of that day and of that hour knoweth no man, nor the angels of
God; but even the Son would not have known if the Father had not known, for the knowledge
naturally His was given by the Father. This is very decorous and becoming the divine nature
to say of the Son, because He has, His knowledge and His being, beheld in all the wisdom
and glory which become His Godhead, from Him with Whom He is consubstantial.</p>
<p>3. As to Jeconias, whom the prophet Jeremiah declares in these words to have been rejected
from the land of Judah, “Jeconias was dishonoured like a vessel for which there is no
more use; and because he was cast out he and his seed; and none shall rise from his seed
sitting upon the throne of David and ruling in Judah,”2991 the matter is plain and clear. On
the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, the kingdom had been destroyed, and
there was no longer an hereditary succession of reigns as before. Nevertheless, at that time,
the deposed descendants of David were living in captivity. On the return of Salathiel and
Zerubbabel the supreme government rested to a greater degree with the people, and the
sovereignty was afterwards transferred to the priesthood, on account of the intermingling
of the priestly and royal tribes; whence the Lord, in things pertaining to God, is both King
and High Priest. Moreover, the royal tribe did not fail until the coming of the Christ; nevertheless,
the seed of Jeconias sat no longer upon the throne of David. Plainly it is the royal
dignity which is described by the term “throne.” You remember the history, how all Judæa,
Idumæa, Moab, both the neighbouring regions of Syria and the further countries up to
Mesopotamia, and the country on the other side as far as the river of Egypt, were all tributary

<note type="footnote">2990 John x. 15.</note>
<note type="footnote">2991 Jer. xxii. 28–30, LXX.</note>

<pb n="770"/>
to David. If then none of his descendants appeared with a sovereignty so wide, how is not
the word of the prophet true that no one of the seed of Jeconias should any longer sit upon
the throne of David, for none of his descendants appears to have attained this dignity.
Nevertheless, the tribe of Judah did not fail, until He for whom it was destined came. But
even He did not sit upon the material throne. The kingdom of Judæa was transferred to
Herod, the son of Antipater the Ascalonite, and his sons who divided Judæa into four
principalities, when Pilate was Procurator and Tiberius was Master of the Roman Empire.
It is the indestructible kingdom which he calls the throne of David on which the Lord sat.
He is the expectation of the Gentiles2992 and not of the smallest division of the world, for
it is written, “In that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the
people; to it shall the Gentiles seek.”2993 “I have called thee…for a covenant of the people
for a light of the Gentiles”;2994 and thus then God remained a priest although He did not
receive the sceptre of Judah, and King of all the earth; so the blessing of Jacob was fulfilled,
and in Him2995 “shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,” and all the nations shall call
the Christ blessed.</p>
<p>4. And as to the tremendous question put by the facetious Encratites, why we do not
eat everything? Let this answer be given, that we turn with disgust from our excrements.
As far as dignity goes, to us flesh is grass; but as to distinction between what is and what is
not serviceable, just as in vegetables, we separate the unwholesome from the wholesome,
so in flesh we distinguish between that which is good and that which is bad for food.
Hemlock is a vegetable, just as vulture’s flesh is flesh; yet no one in his senses would eat
henbane nor dog’s flesh unless he were in very great straits. If he did, however, he would
not sin.</p>
<p>5. Next as to those who maintain that human affairs are governed by fate, do not ask
information from me, but stab them with their own shafts of rhetoric. The question is too
long for my present infirmity. With regard to emerging in baptism—I do not know how it
came into your mind to ask such a question, if indeed you understood immersion to fulfil
the figure of the three days. It is impossible for any one to be immersed three times, without
emerging three times. We write the word φάγος paroxytone.2996</p>
<p>6. The distinction between οὐσία and ὑπόστασις is the same as that between the general
and the particular; as, for instance, between the animal and the particular man. Wherefore,

in the case of the Godhead, we confess one essence or substance so as not to give a variant
definition of existence, but we confess a particular hypostasis, in order that our conception
of Father, Son and Holy Spirit may be without confusion and clear.2997 If we have no distinct
perception of the separate characteristics, namely, fatherhood, sonship, and sanctification,
but form our conception of God from the general idea of existence, we cannot possibly give
a sound account of our faith. We must, therefore, confess the faith by adding the particular
to the common. The Godhead is common; the fatherhood particular. We must therefore
combine the two and say, “I believe in God the Father.” The like course must be pursued
in the confession of the Son; we must combine the particular with the common and say “I
believe in God the Son,” so in the case of the Holy Ghost we must make our utterance conform
to the appellation and say “in God2998 the Holy Ghost.” Hence it results that there is
a satisfactory preservation of the unity by the confession of the one Godhead, while in the
distinction of the individual properties regarded in each there is the confession of the peculiar
properties of the Persons. On the other hand those who identify essence or substance
and hypostasis are compelled to confess only three Persons,2999 and, in their hesitation to
speak of three hypostases, are convicted of failure to avoid the error of Sabellius, for even
Sabellius himself, who in many places confuses the conception, yet, by asserting that the
same hypostasis changed its form3000 to meet the needs of the moment, does endeavour to
distinguish persons.</p>
<p>7. Lastly as to your enquiry in what manner things neutral and indifferent are ordained
for us, whether by some chance working by its own accord, or by the righteous providence
of God, my answer is this: Health and sickness, riches and poverty, credit and discredit,

inasmuch as they do not render their possessors good, are not in the category of things
naturally good, but, in so far as in any way they make life’s current flow more easily, in each
case the former is to be preferred to its contrary, and has a certain kind of value. To some
men these things are given by God for stewardship’s sake,3001 as for instance to Abraham,
to Job and such like. To inferior characters they are a challenge to improvement. For the
man who persists in unrighteousness, after so goodly a token of love from God, subjects
himself to condemnation without defence. The good man, however, neither turns his heart
to wealth when he has it, nor seeks after it if he has it not. He treats what is given him as

<head>Letter CCXXXVII.3002</head>
<p>To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.</p>
<p>1. I both wrote to your reverence by the vicar of Thrace, and sent other letters by one
of the officers of the treasury of Philippopolis, who was starting from our country into
Thrace, and begged him to take them on his departure. But the vicar never received my
letter, for while I was visiting my diocese,3003 he came into town in the evening and started
early in the morning, so that the church officers did not know of his coming, and the letter
remained at my house. The treasurer, too, on account of some unexpected and urgent
business, set out without seeing me or taking my letters. No one else could be found; so I
remained, sorry at not being able to write to you and at not receiving any letter from your
reverence. Yet I was wishful, were it possible, to tell you all that happens to me day by day.
So many astonishing things happen as to need a daily narrative, and you may be sure that
I would have written one, unless my mind had been diverted from its purpose by the pressure
of events.</p>

a man really heretically minded I do not know; for I think that he is quite unversed in doctrine,
and has not the slightest interest or experience in such things, for I see him day and
night busy, both in body and soul, in other things. But he is certainly a friend of heretics;
and he is not more friendly to them than he is ill-disposed to me. He has summoned a
synod of wicked men in mid-winter in Galatia.3004 He has deposed Hypsinus and set up
Ecdicius in his place.3005 He has ordered the removal of my brother on the accusation of
one man, and that one quite insignificant. Then, after being occupied for some little time
about the army, he came to us again breathing rage and slaughter,3006 and, in one sentence,
delivered all the Church of Cæsarea to the Senate. He settled for several days at Sebaste,
separating friends from foes,3007 calling those in communion with me senators, and condemning
them to the public service, while he advanced the adherents of Eustathius. He has

writing, the same gang have hurried to Sebaste to unite with Eustathius, and, with him, to
upset the Church of Nicopolis. For the blessed Theodotus has fallen asleep. Hitherto the
Nicopolitans have bravely and stoutly resisted the vicar’s first assault; for he tried to persuade
them to receive Eustathius, and to accept their bishop on his appointment. But, on seeing
them unwilling to yield, he is now trying, by yet more violent action, to effect the establishment
of the bishop whom it has been attempted to give them.3010 There is, moreover, said
to be some rumoured expectation of a synod, by which means they mean to summon me
to receive them into communion, or to be friendly with them. Such is the position of the
Churches. As to my own health, I think it better to say nothing. I cannot bear not to tell
the truth, and by telling the truth I shall only grieve you.</p>

<head>Letter CCXXXVIII.3011</head>
<p>To the presbyters of Nicopolis.3012</p>
<p>I have received your letter, my reverend brethren, but it told me nothing that I did not
already know, for the whole country round about was already full of the report announcing
the disgrace of that one among you who has fallen, and through lust of vain glory has brought
on himself very shameful dishonour, and has through his self-love lost the rewards promised
to faith. Nay, through the just hatred of them that fear the Lord he misses even that contemptible
little glory for lust of which he has been sold to impiety. By the character he has
now shown he has very plainly proved, concerning all his life, that he has never at any time
lived in hope of the promises laid up for us by the Lord, but, in all his transactions of human
affairs, has used words of faith and mockery of piety, all to deceive every one whom he met.
But how are you injured? Are you any worse off for this than you were before? One of your
number has fallen away, and if one or two others have gone with him, they are to be pitied
for their fall, but, by God’s grace, your body is whole. The useless part has gone, and what
is left has not suffered mutilation. You are haply distressed that you are driven without the
walls, but you shall dwell under the protection of the God of Heaven,3013 and the angel who
watches over the Church has gone out with you. So they lie down in empty places day by
day, bringing upon themselves heavy judgment through the dispersion of the people. And,
if in all this there is sorrow to be borne, I trust in the Lord that it will not be without its use
to you. Therefore, the more have been your trials, look for a more perfect reward from your
just Judge. Do not take your present troubles ill. Do not lose hope. Yet a little while and
your Helper will come to you and will not tarry.3014</p>

<head>Letter CCXXXIX.3015</head>
<p>To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.</p>
<p>1. The Lord has granted me the privilege of now saluting your holiness by our beloved
and very reverend brother, the presbyter Antiochus, of exhorting you to pray for me as you
are wont, and offering in our communication by letter some consolation for our long separation.
And, when you pray, I ask you to beg from the Lord this as the first and greatest
boon, that I may be delivered from vile and wicked men, who have gained such power over
the people that now I seem to see, indeed, a repetition of the events of the taking of Jerusalem.
3016 For the weaker grow the Churches the more does men’s lust for power increase.
And now the very title of bishop has been conferred on wretched slaves, for no servant of
God would choose to come forward in opposition to claim the see;—no one but miserable
fellows like the emissaries of Anysius the creature of Euippius, and of Ecdicius of Parnassus:
whoever has appointed him3017 has sent into the Churches a poor means of aiding his own
entry into the life to come.</p>
<p>They have expelled my brother from Nyssa, and into his place have introduced hardly
a man—a mere scamp3018 worth only an obol or two, but, so far as regards the ruin of the
faith, a match for those who have put him where he is.</p>
<p>At the town of Doara they have brought shame upon the poor name of bishop, and have
sent there a wretch, an orphans’ domestic, a runaway from his own masters, to flatter a
godless woman, who formerly used George as she liked, and now has got this fellow to
succeed him.</p>
<p>And who could properly lament the occurrences at Nicopolis? That unhappy Fronto
did, indeed, for a while pretend to be on the side of the truth, but now he has shamefully
betrayed both the faith and himself, and for the price of his betrayal has got a name of disgrace.
He imagines that he has obtained from these men the rank of bishop; in reality he
has become, by God’s grace, the abomination of all Armenia. But there is nothing that they
will not dare; nothing wherein they are at a loss for worthy accomplices. But the rest of the
news of Syria my brother knows better, and can tell you better, than I.</p>
<p>2. The news of the West you know already, on the recital of brother Dorotheus. What
sort of letters are to be given him on his departure? Perhaps he will travel with the excellent
Sanctissimus, who is full of enthusiasm, journeying through the East, and collecting letters

and signatures from all the men of mark.3019 What ought to be written by them, or how I
can come to an agreement with those who are writing, I do not know. If you hear of any
one soon travelling my way, be so good as to let me know. I am moved to say, as Diomede
said,

<l>“Would God, Atrides, thy request were yet to undertake;</l>
<l><gap reason=" omitted"/>he’s proud enough.”3020</l>
</lg>
</p>
<p>Really lofty souls, when they are courted, get haughtier than ever. If the Lord be propitious
to us, what other thing do we need? If the anger of the Lord lasts on, what help can
come to us from the frown of the West? Men who do not know the truth, and do not wish
to learn it, but are prejudiced by false suspicions, are doing now as they did in the case of
Marcellus,3021 when they quarrelled with men who told them the truth, and by their own
action strengthened the cause of heresy. Apart from the common document, I should like
to have written to their Coryphæus—nothing, indeed, about ecclesiastical affairs except
gently to suggest that they know nothing of what is going on here, and will not accept the
only means whereby they might learn it. I would say, generally, that they ought not to press
hard on men who are crushed by trials. They must not take dignity for pride. Sin only avails
to produce enmity against God.</p>

<head>Letter CCXL.3022</head>
<p>To the Presbyters of Nicopolis.</p>
<p>1. You have done quite right in sending me a letter, and in sending it by the hands of
one who, even if you had not written, would have been perfectly competent to give me
considerable comfort in all my anxieties, and an authentic report as to the position of affairs.
Many vague rumours were continually reaching me, and therefore I was desirous of getting
information on many points from some one able to give it through accurate knowledge.
Touching all these I have received a satisfactory and intelligent narrative from our well-beloved
and honourable brother Theodosius the presbyter. I now write to your reverences
the advice which I give myself, for in many respects our positions are identical; and that not
only at the present moment, but in times gone by too, as many instances may prove. Of
some of these we possess records in writing; others we have received through unwritten recollection
from persons acquainted with the facts. We know how, for the sake of the name
of the Lord, trials have beset alike individuals and cities that have put their trust in Him.
Nevertheless, one and all have passed away, and the distress caused by the days of darkness
has not been everlasting. For just as when hail-storm and flood, and all natural calamities,
at once injure and destroy things that have no strength, while they are only themselves affected
by falling on the strong, so the terrible trials set in action against the Church have
been proved feebler than the firm foundation of our faith in Christ. The hail-storm has
passed away; the torrent has rushed over its bed; clear sky has taken the place of the former,
and the latter has left the course without water and dry, over which it travelled, and has
disappeared in the deep. So, too, in a little while the storm, now bursting upon us, will cease
to be. But this will be on the condition of our being willing not to look to the present, but
to gaze in hope at the future somewhat further off.</p>
<p>2. Is the trial heavy, my brethren? Let us endure the toil. No one who shuns the blows
and the dust of battle wins a crown. Are those mockeries of the devil, and the enemies sent
to attack us, insignificant? They are troublesome because they are his ministers, but contemptible
because God has in them combined wickedness with weakness. Let us beware of
being condemned for crying out too loud over a little pain. Only one thing is worth anguish,
the loss of one’s own self, when for the sake of the credit of the moment, if one can really
call making a public disgrace of one’s self credit, one has deprived one’s self of the everlasting
reward of the just. You are children of confessors; you are children of martyrs; you have
resisted sin unto blood.3023 Use, each one of you, the examples of those near and dear to
<note type="footnote">3022 Placed in 376.</note>
<note type="footnote">3023 cf. Heb. xii. 4.</note>

<pb n="779"/>
you to make you brave for true religion’s sake. No one of us has been torn by lashes;3024
no one of us has suffered confiscation of his house; we have not been driven into exile; we
have not suffered imprisonment. What great suffering have we undergone, unless peradventure
it is grievous that we have suffered nothing, and have not been reckoned worthy of
the sufferings of Christ?3025 But if you are grieved because one whom I need not name occupies
the house of prayer, and you worship the Lord of heaven and earth in the open air,
remember that the eleven disciples were shut up in the upper chamber, when they that had
crucified the Lord were worshipping in the Jews’ far-famed temple. Peradventure, Judas,
who preferred death by hanging to life in disgrace, proved himself a better man than those
who now meet universal condemnation without a blush.</p>
<p>3. Only do not be deceived by their lies when they claim to be of the right faith. They
are not Christians, but traffickers in Christ,3026 always preferring their profit in this life to
living in accordance with the truth. When they thought that they should get this empty
dignity, they joined the enemies of Christ: now that they have seen the indignation of the
people, they are once more for pretending orthodoxy. I do not recognise as bishop—I would
not count among Christ’s clergy3027—a man who has been promoted to a chief post by
polluted hands, to the destruction of the faith. This is my decision. If you have any part
with me, you will doubtless think as I do. If you take counsel on your own responsibility,
every man is master of his own mind, and I am innocent of this blood.3028 I have written
thus, not because I distrust you, but that by declaring my own mind I may strengthen some
men’s hesitation, and prevent any one from being prematurely received into communion,
or after receiving the laying on of hands of our enemies, when peace is made, later on, trying
to force me to enroll them in the ranks of the sacred ministry. Through you I salute the
clergy of the city and diocese, and all the laity who fear the Lord.</p>

<head>Letter CCXLI.3029</head>
<p>To Eusebius, bishop of Samosata.</p>
<p>It is not to increase your distress that I am so lavish of painful topics in my letters to
your excellency. My object is to get some comfort for myself in the lamentations which are
a kind of natural means of dispersing deep-seated pain whenever they are produced, and
further to rouse you, my great-hearted friend, to more earnest prayer on behalf of the
Churches. We know that Moses prayed continually for the people; yet, when his battle with
Amalek had begun, he did not let down his hands from morning to evening, and the uplifting
of the hands of the saint only ended with the end of the fight.</p>

<head>Letter CCXLII.3030</head>
<p>To the Westerns.3031</p>
<p>1. The Holy God has promised a happy of issue out of all their infirmities to those that
trust in Him. We, therefore, though we have been cut off in a mid-ocean of troubles, though
we are tossed by the great waves raised up against us by the spirits of wickedness, nevertheless
hold out in Christ Who strengthens us. We have not slackened the strength of our zeal for
the Churches, nor, as though despairing of our salvation, while the billows in the tempest
rise above our heads, do we look to be destroyed. On the contrary, we are still holding out
with all possible earnestness, remembering how even he who was swallowed by the sea
monster, because he did not despair of his life, but cried to the Lord, was saved. Thus too
we, though we have reached the last pitch of peril, do not give up our hope in God. On
every side we see His succour round about us. For these reasons now we turn our eyes to
you, right honourable brethren. In many an hour of our affliction we have expected that
you would be at our side; and disappointed in that hope we have said to ourselves, “I looked
for some to take pity and there was none; and for comforters but I found none.”3032 Our
sufferings are such as to have reached the confines of the empire; and since, when one
member suffers, all the members suffer,3033 it is doubtless right that your pity should be
shown to us who have been so long in trouble. For that sympathy, which we have hoped
you of your charity feel for us, is caused less by nearness of place than by union of spirit.</p>
<p>2. How comes it to pass then that we have received nothing of what is due to us by the
law of love; no letter of consolation, no visit from brethren? This is now the thirteenth year
since the war of heresy began against us.3034 In this the Churches have suffered more
tribulations than all those which are on record since Christ’s gospel was first preached.3035

<note type="footnote">3031 This and the following letter refer to the earlier of two missions of Dorotheus to the West. In the latter
he carried Letter cclxiii. The earlier was successful at least to the extent of winning sympathy. Maran (Vit. Bas.

<note type="footnote">3034 Valens began the thirteenth year of his reign in the March of 376, and this fact is one of Maran’s reasons
for placing this letter where he does. Tillemont reckons the thirteen years from 361 to 374, but Maran points
out that if the Easterns had wanted to include the persecution of Constantius they might have gone farther back,
while even then the lull under Julian would have broken the continuity of the attack. Vit. Bas. xxxv. cf. note on

I am unwilling to describe these one by one, lest the feebleness of my narrative should make
the evidence of the calamities less convincing. It is moreover the less necessary for me to
tell you of them, because you have long known what has happened from the reports which
will have reached you. The sum and substance of our troubles is this: the people have left
the houses of prayer and are holding congregations in the wildernesses. It is a sad sight.
Women, boys, old men, and those who are in other ways infirm, remain in the open air, in
heavy rain, in the snow, the gales and the frost of winter as well as in summer under the
blazing heat of the sun. All this they are suffering because they refuse to have anything to
do with the wicked leaven of Arius.</p>
<p>3. How could mere words give you any clear idea of all this without your being stirred
to sympathy by personal experience and the evidence of eyewitnesses? We implore you,
therefore, to stretch out a helping hand to those that have already been stricken to the
ground, and to send messengers to remind us of the prizes in store for the reward of all who
patiently suffer for Christ. A voice that we are used to is naturally less able to comfort us
than one which sounds from afar, and that one coming from men who over all the world
are known by God’s grace to be among the noblest; for common report everywhere represents
you as having remained steadfast, without suffering a wound in your faith, and as having
kept the deposit of the apostles inviolate. This is not our case. There are among us some
who, through lust of glory and that puffing up which is especially wont to destroy the souls
of Christian men, have audaciously uttered certain novelties of expression with the result
that the Churches have become like cracked pots and pans and have let in the inrush of
heretical impurity. But do you, whom we love and long for, be to us as surgeons for the
wounded, as trainers for the whole, healing the limb that is diseased, and anointing the limb
that is sound for the service of the true religion.</p>
<note type="footnote">even when matched with the cruelties perpetrated under Nero and Diocletian, if the evidence for them were
satisfactory. cf. Milman, Hist. Christ. iii. 45. The main difference between the earlier persecutions, conventionally
reckoned as ten, and the persecution of the Catholics by Valens, seems to be this, that while the former were a
putting in force of the law against a religio non licita, the latter was but the occasional result of the personal spite
and partizanship of the imperial heretic and his courtiers. Valens would feel bitterly towards a Catholic who
thwarted him. Basil could under Diocletian hardly have died in his bed as archbishop of Cæsarea.</note>

<head>Letter CCXLIII.3036</head>
<p>To the bishops of Italy and Gaul concerning the condition and confusion of the Churches.</p>
<p>1. To his brethren truly God-beloved and very dear, and fellow ministers of like mind,
the bishops of Gaul and Italy, Basil, bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia. Our Lord Jesus
Christ, Who has deigned to style the universal Church of God His body, and has made us
individually members one of another, has moreover granted to all of us to live in intimate
association with one another, as befits the agreement of the members. Wherefore, although
we dwell far away from one another, yet, as regards our close conjunction, we are very near.
Since, then, the head cannot say to the feet, I have no need of you,3037 you will not, I am
sure, endure to reject us; you will, on the contrary, sympathize with us in the troubles to
which, for our sins, we have been given over, in proportion as we rejoice together with you
in your glorying in the peace which the Lord has bestowed on you. Ere now we have also
at another time invoked your charity to send us succour and sympathy; but our punishment
was not full, and you were not suffered to rise up to succour us. One chief object of our
desire is that through you the state of confusion in which we are situated should be made
known to the emperor of your part of the world.3038 If this is difficult, we beseech you to
send envoys to visit and comfort us in our affliction, that you may have the evidence of
eyewitnesses of those sufferings of the East which cannot be told by word of mouth, because
language is inadequate to give a clear report of our condition.</p>
<p>2. Persecution has come upon us, right honourable brethren, and persecution in the
severest form. Shepherds are persecuted that their flocks may be scattered. And the worst
of all is that those who are being treated ill cannot accept their sufferings in proof of their
testimony, nor can the people reverence the athletes as in the army of martyrs, because the
name of Christians is applied to the persecutors. The one charge which is now sure to secure
severe punishment is the careful keeping of the traditions of the Fathers. For this the pious
are exiled from their homes, and are sent away to dwell in distant regions. No reverence is
shown by the judges of iniquity to the hoary head, to practical piety, to the life lived from
boyhood to old age according to the Gospel. No malefactor is doomed without proof, but
bishops have been convicted on calumny alone, and are consigned to penalties on charges
wholly unsupported by evidence. Some have not even known who has accused them, nor

been brought before any tribunal, nor even been falsely accused at all. They have been apprehended
with violence late at night, have been exiled to distant places, and, through the
hardships of these remote wastes, have been given over to death.3039 The rest is notorious,
though I make no mention of it—the flight of priests; the flight of deacons; the foraying of
all the clergy. Either the image must be worshipped, or we are delivered to the wicked flame
of whips.3040 The laity groan; tears are falling without ceasing in public and in private; all
are mutually lamenting their woes. No one’s heart is so hard as to lose a father, and bear
the bereavement meekly. There is a sound of them that mourn in the city—a sound in the
fields, in the roads, in the deserts. But one voice is heard from all that utter sad and piteous
words. Joy and spiritual gladness are taken away. Our feasts are turned into mourning.3041
Our houses of prayer are shut. The altars of the spiritual service are lying idle. Christians
no longer assemble together; teachers no longer preside. The doctrines of salvation are no
longer taught. We have no more solemn assemblies, no more evening hymns, no more of
that blessed joy of souls which arises in the souls of all that believe in the Lord at communions,
and the imparting of spiritual boons.3042 We may well say, “Neither is there at this
time prince, or prophet, or reader, or offering, or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee,
and to find mercy.”3043</p>
<p>3. We are writing to those who know these things, for there is not a region of the world
which is ignorant of our calamities. Do not suppose that we are using these words as though
to give information, or to recall ourselves to your recollection. We know that you could no
more forget us than a mother forget the sons of her womb.3044 But all who are crushed by
any weight of agony find some natural alleviation for their pain in uttering groans of distress,
and it is for this that we are doing as we do. We get rid of the load of our grief in telling you
of our manifold misfortunes, and in expressing the hope that you may haply be the more
moved to pray for us, and may prevail on the Lord to be reconciled to us. And if these afflictions
had been confined to ourselves, we might even have determined to keep silence,
and to rejoice in our sufferings for Christ’s sake, since “the sufferings of this present time
are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.”3045 But at the
present time we are alarmed, lest the mischief growing day by day, like a flame spreading

through some burning wood, when it has consumed what is close at hand, may catch distant
objects too. The plague of heresy is spreading, and there is ground of apprehension lest,
when it has devoured our Churches, it may afterwards creep on even so far as to the sound
portion of your district.3046 Peradventure it is because with us iniquity has abounded that
we have been first delivered to be devoured by the cruel teeth of the enemies of God. But
the gospel of the kingdom began in our regions, and then went forth over all the world. So,
peradventure—and this is most probable—the common enemy of our souls, is striving to
bring it about that the seeds of apostasy, originating in the same quarter, should be distributed
throughout the world. For the darkness of impiety plots to come upon the very hearts
whereon the “light of the knowledge” of Christ has shone.3047</p>
<p>4. Reckon then, as true disciples of the Lord, that our sufferings are yours. We are not
being attacked for the sake of riches, or glory, or any temporal advantages. We stand in the
arena to fight for our common heritage, for the treasure of the sound faith, derived from
our Fathers. Grieve with us, all ye who love the brethren, at the shutting of the mouths of
our men of true religion, and at the opening of the bold and blasphemous lips of all that
utter unrighteousness against God.3048 The pillars and foundation of the truth are scattered
abroad. We, whose insignificance has allowed of our being overlooked, are deprived of our
right of free speech. Do ye enter into the struggle, for the people’s sake. Do not think only
of your being yourselves moored in a safe haven, where the grace of God gives you shelter
from the tempest of the winds of wickedness. Reach out a helping hand to the Churches
that are being buffeted by the storm, lest, if they be abandoned, they suffer complete shipwreck
of the faith. Lament for us, in that the Only-begotten is being blasphemed, and there
is none to offer contradiction. The Holy Ghost is being set at nought and he who is able to
confute the error has been sent into exile. Polytheism has prevailed. Our opponents own
a great God and a small God. “Son” is no longer a name of nature, but is looked upon as a
title of some kind of honour. The Holy Ghost is regarded not as complemental of the Holy
Trinity, nor as participating in the divine and blessed Nature, but as in some sort one of the
number of created beings, and attached to Father and Son, at mere haphazard and as occasion
may require. “Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears,”3049 and I
will weep many days for the people who are being driven to destruction by these vile doctrines.
The ears of the simple are being led astray, and have now got used to heretical impiety.
The nurslings of the Church are being brought up in the doctrines of iniquity. What are
they to do? Our opponents have the command of baptisms; they speed the dying on their

performance of them is in their hands, are so many ties to bind the people to their views.
The result will be that in a little time, even if some liberty be conceded to us, there is small
hope that they who have been long under the influence of error will be recalled to recognition
of the truth.</p>
<p>5. Under these circumstances it would have been well for many of us to have travelled
to your reverences, and to have individually reported each his own position. You may now
take as a proof of the sore straits in which we are placed the fact that we are not even free
to travel abroad. For if any one leaves his Church, even for a very brief space, he will leave
his people at the mercy of those who are plotting their ruin. By God’s mercy instead of
many we have sent one, our very reverend and beloved brother the presbyter Dorotheus.
He is fully able to supply by his personal report whatever has been omitted in our letter, for
he has carefully followed all that has occurred, and is jealous of the right faith. Receive him
in peace, and speedily send him back to us, bringing us good news of your readiness to
succour the brotherhood.</p>
<note type="footnote">3050 I suggest this rendering of προπομπαὶ τῶν ἐξοδευόντων with hesitation, and feel no certainty about the
passage except that the Ben. tr., “deductiones proficiscentium,” and its defence in the Ben. note, is questionable.
The escort of a bishop on a journey is quite on a different plane from the ministrations which Basil has in mind.
προπομπαὶ is used by Chrysostom of funerals, and Combefis explains “excedentium deductæ funebres, deducta
funera;” but the association of ideas seems to necessitate some reference to the effect of vicious teaching on the
living. There may be an indirect allusion to the effect on the friends at a funeral, but to take ἐξοδευόντων to
mean “the dying” seems the simplest. ἐξοδευθείς is used of Sisera in Judges v. 27, LXX. cf. p. 180 n., where
perhaps this rendering might be substituted, and Canon Bright on Canon xiii. of Nicæa.</note>

<head>Letter CCXLIV.3051</head>
<p>To Patrophilus, bishop of Ægæ.3052</p>
<p>1. I have read, and read with pleasure, the letter which you have sent by Strategius the
presbyter. How should I not so read it, written as it is by a wise man, and dictated by a heart
which has learned to observe the universal love taught by the commandment of the Lord?
Possibly I am not unaware of the reasons which have hitherto kept you silent. You have
been, as it were, amazed and astounded, at the idea of the change in the notorious Basil.
Why, ever since he was a boy he did such and such service to such an one; at such and such
times he did such and such things; he waged war against foes innumerable for the sake of
his allegiance to one man; now he has become a totally different character; he has exchanged
love for war; he is all that you have written; so you naturally shew considerable astonishment
at the very unexpected turn of affairs. And if you have found some fault, I do not take it
ill. I am not so beyond correction as to be amazed at the affectionate rebukes of my brothers.
Indeed so far was I from being vexed at your letter that it really almost made me laugh to
think that when there were, as I thought, so many strong causes already existing to cement
our friendship, you should have expressed such very great astonishment at the trifles which
have been reported to you. So truly have you suffered the fate of all those who omit to enquire
into the nature of circumstances, and give heed to the men who are being discussed; of all
who do not examine into the truth, but judge by the distinction of persons, in forgetfulness
of the exhortion “Ye shall not respect persons in judgment.”3053</p>
 <p>2. Nevertheless, since God in judgment of man does not accept persons, I will not refuse
to make known to you the defence which I have prepared for the great tribunal. On my
side, from the beginning, there has been no cause of quarrel, either small or great; but men
who hate me, for what reason is best known to themselves (I must not say a word about
them), incessantly calumniated me. I cleared myself again and again of slanders. There
seemed no end to the matter, and no good came of my continual defence, because I was far
away, and the authors of the false statements, being on the spot, were able by their calumnies
against me to wound a susceptible heart, and one which has never learnt to keep one ear
open for the absent. When the Nicopolitans, as you yourself are partly aware, were asking

<pb n="788"/>
for some proof of faith, I determined to have recourse to the written document.3054 I thought
that I should fulfil two objects at once; I expected both to persuade the Nicopolitans not to
think ill of the man,3055 and to shut the mouths of my calumniators, because agreement in
faith would exclude slander on both sides. Indeed the creed had been drawn up, and it was
brought from me, and signed. After it had been signed, a place was appointed for a second
meeting, and another date fixed, so that my brethren in the diocese might come together
and be united with one another, and our communion for the future be genuine and sincere.
I, for my part, arrived at the appointed time, and, of the brethren who act with me, some
were on the spot, and others were hurrying thither, all joyous and eager as though on the
high road to peace.3056 Couriers and a letter from myself announced my arrival; for the
spot appointed for the reception of those who were assembling was mine. But nobody appeared
on the other side; no one came in advance; no one to announce the approach of the
expected bishops. So those who had been sent by me returned with the report of the deep
dejection and the complaints of those who were assembled, as though a new creed had been
promulgated by me. They were moreover said to be for deciding, that they certainly would
not suffer their bishop to go over to me. Then came a messenger bringing me a letter hastily
drawn up, and containing no mention of the points originally agreed on. My brother
Theophilus,3057 a man worthy of all respect and honour at my hands, sent one of his adherents,
and made certain announcements, which he thought it not improper for him to utter,
nor unbecoming in me to hear. He did not condescend to write, not so much because he
was afraid of being convicted on written evidence, as because he was anxious not to be
compelled to address me as bishop. Assuredly his language was violent, and came from a
heart a vehemently agitated. Under these circumstances I departed abashed and depressed,
not knowing what to answer to my questioners. Then, without any long interval of time,
there was the journey into Cilicia,3058 the return thence, and forthwith a letter repudiating
communion with me.3059</p>
<p>3. The cause of the rupture was the allegation that I wrote to Apollinarius and was in
communion with the presbyter Diodorus. I never regarded Apollinarius as an enemy, and
for some reasons I even respect him. But I never so far united myself to him as to take upon

me the charges against him; indeed I have myself some accusations to bring against him
after reading some of his books. I do not know that I ever asked him for a book on the Holy
Spirit, or received it on his sending: I am told that he has become a most copious writer,
but I have read very few of his works.3060 I have not even time to investigate such matters.
Indeed I shrink from admitting any of the more recent works, for my health does not even
allow of my reading the inspired Scriptures with diligence and as I ought. What, then, is it
to me, if some one has written something displeasing to somebody else? Yet if one man is
to render an account on behalf of another, let him who accuses me for Apollinarius’ sake
defend himself to me for the sake of Arius his own master and of Aetius his own disciple.
I never learnt anything from, nor taught anything to this man whose guilt is laid at my door.
Diodorus, as a nursling of the blessed Silvanus, I did receive from the beginning: I love him
now and respect him on account of his grace of speech, whereby many who meet him are
made the better men.3061</p>
<p>4. At this letter I was affected in such a manner as might be expected, and astounded
at so sudden and pleasant a change. I felt quite unable to reply. My heart could hardly beat;
my tongue failed me, and my hand grew numb. I felt like a poor creature (for the truth shall
be told; yet it is pardonable); I all but fell into a state of misanthropy; I looked on every one
with suspicion and thought that there was no charity to be found in mankind. Charity
seemed a mere specious word, serving as a kind of decoration to those who use it, while no
such sentiment was really to be found in the heart of man. Could it really be that one who
seemed to have disciplined himself from boyhood to old age, could be so easily brutalized
on such grounds, without a thought for me, without any idea that his experience of bygone
years ought to have more weight than this wretched slander? Could he really, like an unbroken
colt as yet untaught to carry his rider properly, on some petty suspicion rear and
unseat his rider and fling to the ground what was once his pride? If so, what must be thought
of the rest with whom I had no such strong ties of friendship, and who had given no such
proofs of a well trained life? All this I turned over in my soul and continually revolved in
my heart, or, shall I rather say my heart was turned over by these things fighting and
pricking me at the recollection of them? I wrote no answer; not that I kept silence from
contempt; do not think it of me my brother, for I am not defending myself to men but I

speak before God in Christ. I kept silence from utter inability to say a word commensurate
with my grief.</p>
<p>5. While I was in this position another letter came to me, addressed to a certain Dazizas,
but in reality written to all the world. This is obvious from its very rapid distribution, for
in a few days it was delivered all over Pontus, and was travelling about Galatia; indeed it is
said that the carriers of this good news traversed Bithynia, and reached the Hellespont itself.
What was written against me to Dazizas3062 you are very well aware, for they do not reckon
you as so far beyond the bounds of their friendship as to have left you alone undistinguished
by this honour. However, if the letter has not reached you, I will send it to you. In it you
will find me charged with craft and treachery, with corruption of Churches and with ruin
of souls. The charge which they think the truest of all is, that I made that exposition of the
faith for secret and dishonest reasons, not to do service to the Nicopolitans, but with the
design of disingenously extracting a confession from them. Of all this the Lord is Judge.
What clear evidence can there be of the thoughts of the heart? One thing I do wonder at in
them, that after signing the document presented by me, they show so much disagreement,
that they confuse truth and falsehood to satisfy those who are accusing them, quite forgetful
that their written confession of the Nicene Creed is preserved at Rome, and that they with
their own hand delivered to the council at Tyana the document brought from Rome which
is in my hands, and contains the same creed. They forgot their own address, when they
came forward and bewailed the deceit by which they had been tricked into giving their adhesion
to the document drawn up by the faction of Eudoxius,3063 and so bethought them
of the defence for that error, that they should go to Rome3064 and there accept the creed of
the Fathers, that so they might make amends, for the mischief they had done the Church
by their agreement in evil, by their introduction of something better. Now the very men
who undertook long journeys for the faith’s sake, and made all these fine speeches, are reviling
me for walking craftily, and for playing the plotter under the cloke of love. It is plain from
the Letter, now being carried about, that they have condemned the faith of Nicæa. They
saw Cyzicus, and came home with another creed.3065</p>
<p>6. But why say anything of mere verbal inconsistency? The practical proofs of their
change of position afforded by their conduct are far stronger. They refused to yield to the
sentence of fifty bishops passed against them.3066 They declined to resign the government

of their Churches although the number of bishops assenting to the decree for their deposition
was so many, on the alleged ground that they were not partakers of the Holy Ghost, and
were not governing their Churches by the grace of God, but had clutched their dignity by
the aid of human power, and through lust of vain glory. Now they are for receiving the men
consecrated by these same persons as bishops. I should like you to ask them in my stead,
(although they despise all mankind, as bereft of eyes, ears, and common sense), to perceive
the inconsistency of their conduct, what sentiments they do really entertain in their own
hearts. How can there be two bishops, one deposed by Euippius,3067 and the other consecrated
by him? Both are the actions of the same man. Had he not been endowed with the
grace bestowed upon Jeremiah to pull down and build again, to root out and to plant,3068
he certainly would not have rooted the one out and planted the other. Grant him the one
and you must grant him the other. Their one object, as it seems, is everywhere to look to
their own advantage, and to regard every one who acts in accordance with their own wishes
as a friend, while they treat any one who opposes them as an enemy, and spare no calumny
to run him down.3069</p>
<p>7. What measures are they now taking against the Church? For the shiftiness of their
originators, shocking; for the apathy of all who are affected by them, pitiable. By a respectable
commission the children and grandchildren of Euippius have been summoned from distant
regions to Sebasteia, and to them the people have been entrusted.3070 They have taken
possession of the altar. They have been made the leaven of that Church. I am persecuted
by them as a Homoousiast. Eustathius, who brought the Homoousion in the script from
Rome to Tyana, although he was not able to get admitted into their much to be coveted
communion, either because they feared, or respected the authority of, the large number of
persons who had agreed in condemning him, is now in intimate alliance with them. I only
hope that I may never have time enough on my hands to tell of all their doings—who were
gathered together, how each one had been ordained, and from what kind of earlier life each
arrived at his present dignity. I have been taught to pray “that my mouth may not utter the

forward by Eustathius, and immediately answered by Basil, but there seems no necessity of this. Basil says
nothing for or against the powers of the bishops who condemned Eustathius; he only points out the inconsistency
of Eustathius in accepting their powers to ordain when it suited his purpose, while he refused to admit their
authority to depose. It is enough for Basil’s argument that Eustathius treated him as having authority. On Basil’s

works of the men.”3071 If you enquire you will learn these things for yourself, and, if they
are hidden from you, they will not assuredly continue hidden from the judges.</p>
<p>8. I will not, however, omit to tell you, my dear friend, in what a state I have been. Last
year I suffered from a very violent fever, and came near to the gates of death. When, by
God’s mercy, I was restored, I was distressed at coming back to life, as I bethought me of
all the troubles before me. I considered with myself for what reason, hidden in the depths
of the wisdom of God, yet further days of life in the flesh had been allowed me. But when
I heard of these matters I concluded that the Lord wished me to see the Churches at rest
after the storm which they had previously suffered from the alienation of the men in whom,
on account of their fictitious gravity of character, every confidence had been placed. Or
peradventure the Lord designed to invigorate my soul, and to render it more vigilant for
the future, to the end that, instead of giving heed to men, it might be made perfect through
those precepts of the Gospel which do not share in the changes and chances of human seasons
and circumstances, but abide for ever the same, as they were uttered by the blessed lips that
cannot lie.3072</p>
<p>9. Men are like clouds, shifting hither and thither in the sky with the change of the
winds.3073 And of all men who have ever come within my experience these of whom I am
speaking are the most unstable. As to the other business of life, those who have lived with
them may give evidence; but as to what is within my own knowledge, their inconsistency
as regards the faith, I do not know that I have ever myself observed it or heard from any
one else, of anything like it. Originally they were followers of Arius; then they went over to
Hermogenes, who was diametrically opposed to the errors of Arius, as is evinced by the
Creed originally recited by him at Nicæa.3074 Hermogenes, fell asleep, and then they went
over to Eusebius, the Coryphæus, as we know on personal evidence, of the Arian ring.
Leaving this, for whatever reasons, they came home again, and once more concealed their
Arian sentiments. After reaching the episcopate, to pass by what occurred in the interval,
how many creeds did they put forth? One at Ancyra;3075 another at Seleucia;3076 another

that I am told that they have suppressed the homoousion, and are supporting the like in es-
sence, while they subscribe with Eunomius the blasphemies against the Holy Spirit. Although
all of the creeds which I have enumerated may not be opposed to one another, yet they alike
exhibit the inconsistency of the men’s minds, from their never standing by the same words.
I have said nothing as to countless other points, but this that I do say is true. Now that they
have gone over to you, I beg you to write back by the same man, I mean our fellow presbyter
Strategius, whether you have remained in the same mind towards me, or whether you have
been alienated in consequence of your meeting them. For it was not likely that they would
be silent, nor that you yourself, after writing to me as you have, would not use free speaking
to them too. If you remain in communion with me, it is well; it is what I would most earnestly
pray for. If they have drawn you over to them, it is sad. How should separation from such
a brother not be sad? If in nothing else, at least in bearing losses like this, we have been

those who should least of all have allowed anything of the kind. Pardon me, therefore, for

<p>So far as my own wishes are concerned I am grieved at living at such a distance from

you out of this conflagration which has specially ravaged my diocese. For the just Judge has
sent me, in accordance with my works, a messenger of Satan,3088 who is buffeting me3089
severely enough, and is vigorously defending the heresy. Indeed to such a pitch has he
carried the war against us, that he does not shrink even from shedding the blood of those
who trust in God. You cannot fail to have heard that a man of the name of Asclepius,3090

and teachers, and all that might be expected to be done by men abusing the imperial authority
at their own caprice. But, in answer to your prayers, the Lord will give us release from these
things, and patience to bear the weight of our trials worthily of our hope in Him. Pray write

<head>Letter CCL.3093</head>
<p>To Patrophilus, bishop of Ægæ.</p>
<p>There has been some delay in my receiving your answer to my former letter; but it has
reached me through the well-beloved Strategius, and I have given thanks to the Lord for
your continuance in your love to me. What you have now been kind enough to write on
the same subject proves your good intentions, for you think as you ought, and you counsel
me to my gain. But I see that my words will be extending too far, if I am to reply to everything
written to me by your excellency. I therefore say no more than this, that, if the blessing of
peace goes no further than the mere name of peace, it is ridiculous to go on picking out here
one and there another, and allow them alone a share in the boon, while others beyond
number are excluded from it. But if agreement with mischievous men, under the appearance
of peace, really does the harm an enemy might do to all who consent to it, then only consider
who those men are who have been admitted to their companionship, who have conceived
an unrighteous hatred against me; who but men of the faction not in communion with me.
There is no need now for me to mention them by name. They have been invited by them
to Sebasteia; they have assumed the charge of the Church; they have performed service at
the altar: they have given of their own bread to all the people, being proclaimed bishops by
the clergy there, and escorted through all the district as saints and in communion. If one
must adopt the faction of these men, it is absurd to begin at the extremities, and not rather
to hold intercourse with those that are their heads.3094 If then we are to count heretic and
shun no one at all, why, tell me, do you separate yourself from the communion of certain
persons? But if any are to be shunned, let me be told by these people who are so logically
consistent in everything, to what party those belong whom they have invited over from
Galatia to join them? If such things seem grievous to you, charge the separation on those
who are responsible for it. If you judge them to be of no importance, forgive me for declining
to be of the leaven of the teachers of wrong doctrine.3095 Wherefore, if you will, have no
more to do with those specious arguments, but with all openness confute them that do not
walk aright in the truth of the Gospel.</p>

<head>Letter CCLI.3096</head>
<p>To the people of Evæsæ.3097</p>
<p>1. My occupations are very numerous, and my mind is full of many anxious cares, but
I have never forgotten you, my dear friends, ever praying my God for your constancy in the
faith, wherein ye stand and have your boasting in the hope of the glory of God. Truly
nowadays it is hard to find, and extraordinary to see, a Church pure, unharmed by the
troubles of the times, and preserving the apostolic doctrine in all its integrity and completeness.
Such is your Church shewn at this present time by Him who in every generation makes
manifest them that are worthy of His calling. May the Lord grant to you the blessings of
Jerusalem which is above, in return for your flinging back at the heads of the liars their
slanders against me, and your refusal to allow them entry into your hearts. I know, and am
persuaded in the Lord, that “your reward is great in heaven,”3098 even on account of this
very conduct. For you have wisely concluded among yourselves, as indeed is the truth, that
the men who are “rewarding me evil for good, and hatred for my love,”3099 are accusing me
now for the very same points which they are found to have themselves confessed and subscribed.</p>
<p>2. Their presenting you with their own signatures for an accusation against me is not
the only contradiction into which they have fallen. They were unanimously deposed by the
bishops assembled at Constantinople.3100 They refused to accept this deposition and appealed
to a synod of impious men,3101 refusing to admit the episcopacy of their judges, in
order not to accept the sentence passed upon them.</p>
<p>The reason alleged for their non-recognition was their being leaders of wicked heresy.
All this3102 happened nearly seventeen years ago. The principal men of those who deposed
them were Eudoxius, Euippius, George,3103 Acacius, and others unknown to you.3104</p>
<p>The present tyrants of the churches are their successors, some ordained to fill their
places, and others actually promoted by them.</p>

<p>3. Now let those who charge me with unsound doctrine tell me in what way the men
whose deposition they refused to accept were heretical. Let them tell me in what way those
promoted by them, and holding the same views as their fathers, are orthodox. If Euippius
was orthodox, how can Eustathius, whom he deposed, be other than a layman? If Euippius
was a heretic, how can any one ordained by him be in communion with Eustathius now?
But all this conduct, this trying to accuse men and set them up again, is child’s play, got up
against the Churches of God, for their own gain.</p>
<p>When Eustathius was travelling through Paphlagonia, he overthrew the altars3105 of
Basilides of Paphlagonia,3106 and used to perform divine service on his own tables.3107
Now he is begging Basilides to be admitted to communion. He refused to communicate
with our reverend brother Elpidius, because of his alliance with the Amasenes;3108 and now
he comes as a suppliant to the Amasenes, petitioning for alliance with them. Even ye
yourselves know how shocking were his public utterances against Euippius: now he glorifies
the holders of Euippius’s opinions for their orthodoxy, if only they will cooperate in promoting
his restitution. And I am all the while being calumniated, not because I am doing any
wrong, but because they have imagined that they will thus be recommended to the party at
Antioch. The character of those whom they sent for last year from Galatia, as being likely
by their means to recover the free exercise of their episcopal powers, is only too well known
to all who have lived even for a short time with them. I pray that the Lord may never allow
me leisure to recount all their proceedings. I will only say that they have passed through
the whole country, with the honour and attendance of bishops, escorted by their most
honourable bodyguard and sympathizers; and have made a grand entry into the city, and
held an assembly with all authority. The people have been given over to them. The altar
has been given over to them. How they went to Nicopolis, and could do nothing there of
all that they had promised, and how they came, and what appearance they presented on
their return, is known to those who were on the spot. They are obviously taking every single
step for their own gain and profit. If they say that they have repented, let them shew their
repentance in writing; let them anathematize the Creed of Constantinople; let them separate
from the heretics; and let them no longer trick the simple-minded. So much for them and
theirs.</p>
<p>4. I, however, brethren beloved, small and insignificant as I am, but remaining ever by
God’s grace the same, have never changed with the changes of the world. My creed has not

varied at Seleucia, at Constantinople, at Zela,3109 at Lampsacus, and at Rome. My present
creed is not different from the former; it has remained ever one and the same. As we received
from the Lord, so are we baptized; as we are baptized, so we make profession of our faith;
as we make profession of our faith, so do we offer our doxology, not separating the Holy
Ghost from Father and Son, nor preferring Him in honour to the Father, or asserting Him
to be prior to the Son, as blasphemers’ tongues invent.3110 Who could be so rash as to reject
the Lord’s commandment, and boldly devise an order of his own for the Names? But I do
not call the Spirit, Who is ranked with Father and Son, a creature. I do not dare to call
slavish that which is royal.3111 And I beseech you to remember the threat uttered by the
Lord in the words, “All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the
blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men, neither in this world,
neither in the world to come.”3112 Keep yourselves from dangerous teaching against the
Spirit. “Stand fast in the faith.”3113 Look over all the world, and see how small the part is
which is unsound. All the rest of the Church which has received the Gospel. from one end
of the world to the other, abides in this sound and unperverted doctrine. From their communion
I pray that I may never fall, and I pray that I may have part and lot with you in the
righteous day of our Lord Jesus Christ, when He shall come to give to every one according
to his conduct.</p>

<p>To the bishops of the Pontic Diocese.3115</p>
<p>The honours of martyrs ought to be very eagerly coveted by all who rest their hopes on
the Lord, and more especially by you who seek after virtue. By your disposition towards
the great and good among your fellow servants you are shewing your affection to our common
Lord. Moreover, a special reason for this is to be found in the tie, as it were, of blood,
which binds the life of exact discipline to those who have been made perfect through endurance.
Since then Eupsychius and Damas and their company are most illustrious among
martyrs, and their memory is yearly kept in our city and all the neighbourhood, the Church,
calling on you by my voice, reminds you to keep up your ancient custom of paying a visit.
A great and good work lies before you among the people, who desire to be edified by you,
and are anxious for the reward dependent on the honour paid to the martyrs. Receive,
therefore, my supplications, and consent of your kindness to give at the cost of small trouble
to yourselves a great boon to me.3116</p>

Cyril, he said, ‘I followed my exarch,’ meaning John of Antioch (Mansi vii. 237; compare Evagrius iv. 11, using
‘patriarchs’ and ‘exarchs’ synonymously). Reference is here made not to all such prelates, but to the bishops of
Ephesus, Cæsarea in Cappadocia, and Heraclea, if, as seems possible, the see of Heraclea still nominally retained

<p>To the very well beloved and reverend brethren the presbyters Acacius, Aetius, Paulus, and
Silvanus; the deacons Silvinus and Lucius, and the rest of the brethren the monks, Basil,
the bishop.3124</p>
<p>News has reached me of the severe persecution carried on against you, and how directly
after Easter the men who fast for strife and debate3125 attacked your homes, and gave your
labours to the flames, preparing for you indeed a house in the heavens, not made with
hands,3126 but for themselves laying up in store the fire which they had used to your hurt.
I no sooner heard of this than I groaned over what had happened; pitying not you, my
brethren, (God forbid!) but the men who are so sunk in wickedness as to carry their evil
deeds to such an extent. I expected you all to hurry at once to the refuge prepared for you
in my humble self; and I hoped that the Lord would give me refreshment in the midst of
my continual troubles in embracing you, and in receiving on this inactive body of mine the
noble sweat which you are dropping for the truth’s sake, and so having some share in the
prizes laid up for you by the Judge of truth. But this did not enter into your minds, and you
did not even expect any relief at my hands. I was therefore at least anxious to find frequent
opportunities of writing to you, to the end that like those who cheer on combatants in the
arena, I might myself by letter give you some encouragement in your good fight. For two
reasons, however, I have not found this easy. In the first place, I did not know where you
were residing. And, secondly, but few of our people travel in your direction. Now the Lord
has brought us the very well beloved and reverend brother Sanctissimus, the presbyter. By
him I am able to salute you, and I beseech you to pray for me, rejoicing and exulting that
your reward is great in heaven,3127 and that you have freedom with the Lord to cease not
day and night calling on Him to put an end to this storm of the Churches; to grant the
shepherds to their flocks, and that the Church may return to her proper dignity. I am persuaded
that if a voice be found to move our good God, He will not make His mercy afar off,
but will now “with the temptation make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.”3128

<head>Letter CCLVII.3129</head>
<p>To the monks harassed by the Arians.</p>
<p>1. I have thought it only right to announce to you by letter how I said to myself, when
I heard of the trials brought upon you by the enemies of God, that in a time reckoned a time
of peace you have won for yourselves the blessings promised to all who suffer persecution
for the sake of the name of Christ. In my judgment the war that is waged against us by our
fellow countrymen is the hardest to bear, because against open and declared enemies it is
easy to defend ourselves, while we are necessarily at the mercy of those who are associated
with us, and are thus exposed to continual danger. This has been your case. Our fathers
were persecuted, but by idolaters their substance was plundered, their houses were overthrown,
they themselves were driven into exile, by our open enemies, for Christ’s name’s
sake. The persecutors who have lately appeared, hate us no less than they, but, to the deceiving
of many, they put forward the name of Christ, that the persecuted may be robbed of all
comfort from its confession, because the majority of simpler folk, while admitting that we
are being wronged, are unwilling to reckon our death for the truth’s sake to be martyrdom.
I am therefore persuaded that the reward in store for you from the righteous Judge is yet
greater than that bestowed on those former martyrs. They indeed both had the public praise
of men, and received the reward of God; to you, though your good deeds are not less, no
honours are given by the people. It is only fair that the requital in store for you in the world
to come should be far greater.</p>
<p>2. I exhort you, therefore, not to faint in your afflictions, but to be revived by God’s
love, and to add daily to your zeal, knowing that in you ought to be preserved that remnant
of true religion which the Lord will find when He cometh on the earth. Even if bishops are
driven from their Churches, be not dismayed. If traitors have arisen from among the very
clergy3130 themselves, let not this undermine your confidence in God. We are saved not
by names, but by mind and purpose, and genuine love toward our Creator. Bethink you
how in the attack against our Lord, high priests and scribes and elders devised the plot, and
how few of the people were found really receiving the word. Remember that it is not the
multitude who are being saved, but the elect of God. Be not then affrighted at the great
multitude of the people who are carried hither and thither by winds like the waters of the
sea. If but one be saved, like Lot at Sodom, he ought to abide in right judgment, keeping
his hope in Christ unshaken, for the Lord will not forsake His holy ones. Salute all the
brethren in Christ from me. Pray earnestly for my miserable soul.</p>

<head>Letter CCLVIII.3131</head>
<p>To Epiphanius the bishop.3132</p>
<p>1. It has long been expected that, in accordance with the prediction of our Lord, because
of iniquity abounding, the love of the majority would wax cold.3133 Now experience has
confirmed this expectation. But though this condition of things has already obtained among
us here, it seems to be contradicted by the letter brought from your holiness. For verily it
is no mere ordinary proof of love, first that you should remember an unworthy and insignificant
person like myself; and secondly, that you should send to visit me brethren who are
fit and proper ministers of a correspondence of peace. For now, when every man is viewing
every one else with suspicion, no spectacle is rarer than that which you are presenting.
Nowhere is pity to be seen; nowhere sympathy; nowhere a brotherly tear for a brother in
distress. Not persecutions for the truth’s sake, not Churches with all their people in tears;
not this great tale of troubles closing round us, are enough to stir us to anxiety for the welfare
of one another. We jump on them that are fallen; we scratch and tear at wounded places;
we who are supposed to agree with one another launch the curses that are uttered by the
heretics; men who are in agreement on the most important matters are wholly severed from
one another on some one single point. How, then, can I do otherwise than admire him who
in such circumstances shews that his love to his neighbour is pure and guileless, and, though
separated from me by so great a distance of sea and land, gives my soul all the care he can?</p>
<p>2. I have been specially struck with admiration at your having been distressed even by
the dispute of the monks on the Mount of Olives, and at your expressing a wish that some
means might be found of reconciling them to one another. I have further been glad to hear
that you have not been unaware of the unfortunate steps, taken by certain persons, which
have caused disturbance among the brethren, and that you have keenly interested yourself
even in these matters. But I have deemed it hardly worthy of your wisdom that you should
entrust the rectification of matters of such importance to me: for I am not guided by the
grace of God, because of my living in sin; I have no power of eloquence, because I have
cheerfully withdrawn from vain studies; and I am not yet sufficiently versed in the doctrines
of the truth. I have therefore already written to my beloved brethren at the Mount of Olives,

accepted them, as being beyond my comprehension.3135 I know well that, if once we begin
to interfere with the simplicity of the Creed, we shall embark on interminable discussion,
contradiction ever leading us on and on, and shall but disturb the souls of simpler folk by
the introduction of new phrases.3136</p>
<p>3. As to the Church at Antioch (I mean that which is in agreement in the same doctrine),
may the Lord grant that one day we may see it united. It is in peril of being specially open
to the attacks of the enemy, who is angry with it because there the name of Christian first
obtained.3137 There heresy is divided against orthodoxy, and orthodoxy is divided against
herself.3138 My position, however, is this. The right reverend bishop Meletius was the first
to speak boldly for the truth, and fought that good fight in the days of Constantine. Therefore
my Church has felt strong affection towards him, for the sake of that brave and firm stand,
and has held communion with him. I, therefore, by God’s grace, have held him to be in
communion up to this time; and, if God will, I shall continue to do so. Moreover the very
blessed Pope Athanasius came from Alexandria, and was most anxious that communion
should be established between Meletius and himself; but by the malice of counsellors their
conjunction was put off to another season. Would that this had not been so! I have never
accepted communion with any one of those who have since been introduced into the see,
not because I count them unworthy, but because I see no ground for the condemnation of
Meletius. Nevertheless I have heard many things about the brethren, without giving heed
to them, because the accused were not brought face to face with their accusers, according
to that which is written, “Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what

I ought not to be forced to do so. It will be becoming to your peaceful disposition not to
cause union in one direction and disunion in another, but to restore the severed member
to the original union. First, then, pray; next, to the utmost of your ability, exhort, that ambition
may be driven from their hearts, and that reconciliation may be effected between
them both to restore strength to the Church, and to destroy the rage of our foes. It has
given great comfort to my soul that, in addition to your other right and accurate statements
in theology, you should acknowledge the necessity of stating that the hypostases are three.
Let the brethren at Antioch be instructed by you after this manner. Indeed I am confident

<p>4. The Magusæans,3140 as you were good enough to point out to me in your other letter,
are here in considerable numbers, scattered all over the country, settlers having long ago
been introduced into these parts from Babylon. Their manners are peculiar, as they do not
mix with other men. It is quite impossible to converse with them, inasmuch as they have
been made the prey of the devil to do his will. They have no books; no instructors in doctrine.
They are brought up in senseless institutions, piety being handed down from father
to son. In addition to the characteristics which are open to general observation, they object
to the slaying of animals as defilement, and they cause the animals they want for their own
use to be slaughtered by other people. They are wild after illicit marriages; they consider
fire divine, and so on.3141 No one hitherto has told me any fables about the descent of the
Magi from Abraham: they name a certain Zarnuas as the founder of their race. I have
nothing more to write to your excellency about them.</p>

<p>To Optimus the bishop.3144</p>
<p>1. Under any circumstances I should have gladly seen the good lads, on account of both
a steadiness of character beyond their years, and their near relationship to your excellency,
which might have led me to expect something remarkable in them. And, when I saw them
approaching me with your letter, my affection towards them was doubled. But now that I
have read the letter, now that I have seen all the anxious care for the Church that there is in
it, and the evidence it affords of your zeal in reading the divine Scriptures, I thank the Lord.
And I invoke blessings on those who brought me such a letter, and, even before them, on
the writer himself.</p>
<p>2. You have asked for a solution of that famous passage which is everywhere interpreted
in different senses, “Whosoever slayeth Cain will exact vengeance for seven sins.”3145 Your
question shews that you have yourself carefully observed the charge of Paul to Timothy,3146
for you are obviously attentive to your reading. You have moreover roused me, old man
that I am, dull alike from age and bodily infirmity, and from the many afflictions which
have been stirred up round about me and have weighed down my life. Fervent in spirit as
you are yourself, you are rousing me, now benumbed like a beast in his den, to some little
wakefulness and vital energy. The passage in question may be interpreted simply and may
also receive an elaborate explanation. The simpler, and one that may occur to any one off
hand, is this: that Cain ought to suffer sevenfold punishment for his sins.</p>
<p>For it is not the part of a righteous judge to define requital on the principle of like for
like, but the originator of evil must pay his debt with addition, if he is to be made better by
punishment and render other men wiser by his example. Therefore, since it is ordained
that Cain pay the penalty of his sin sevenfold, he who kills him, it is said, will discharge the
sentence pronounced against him by the divine judgment. This is the sense that suggests
itself to us on our first reading the passage.</p>
<p>3. But readers, gifted with greater curiosity, are naturally inclined to probe into the
question further. How, they ask, can justice be satisfied seven times? And what are the
vengeances? Are they for seven sins committed? Or is the sin committed once and are there
seven punishments for the one sin? Scripture continually assigns seven as the number of
the remission of sins. “How often,” it is asked, “shall my brother sin against me and I forgive

him?” (It is Peter who is speaking to the Lord.) “Till seven times?” Then comes the Lord’s
answer, “I say not unto thee, until seven times, but, until seventy times seven.”3147 Our
Lord did not vary the number, but multiplied the seven, and so fixed the limit of the forgiveness.
After seven years the Hebrew used to be freed from slavery.3148 Seven weeks of years
used in old times to make the famous jubilee,3149 in which the land rested, debts were remitted,
slaves were set free, and, as it were, a new life began over again, the old life from age to
age being in a sense completed at the number seven. These things are types of this present
life, which revolves in seven days and passes by, wherein punishments of slighter sins are
inflicted, according to the loving care of our good Lord, to save us from being delivered to
punishment in the age that has no end. The expression seven times is therefore introduced
because of its connexion with this present world for men who love this world ought specially
to be punished in the things for the sake of which they have chosen to live wicked lives. If
you understand the vengeances to be for the sins committed by Cain, you will find those
sins to be seven. Or if you understand them to mean the sentence passed on him by the
Judge, you will not go far wrong. To take the crimes of Cain: the first sin is envy at the
preference of Abel; the second is guile, whereby he said to his brother, “Let us go into the
field:”3150 the third is murder, a further wickedness: the fourth, fratricide, a still greater
iniquity: the fifth that he committed the first murder, and set a bad example to mankind:
the sixth wrong in that he grieved his parents: the seventh, his lie to God; for when he was
asked, “Where is Abel thy brother?” he replied, “I know not.”3151 Seven sins were therefore
avenged in the destruction of Cain. For when the Lord said, “Cursed is the earth which has
opened to receive the blood of thy brother,” and “groaning and trembling shall there be on
the earth,” Cain said, “If thou castest me out to-day from the earth, then from thy face shall
I be hid, and groaning and trembling shall I lie upon the earth, and every one that findeth
me shall slay me.” It is in answer to this that the Lord says, “Whosoever slayeth Cain will
discharge seven vengeances.”3152 Cain supposed that he would be an easy prey to every
one, because of there being no safety for him in the earth (for the earth was cursed for his
sake), and of his being deprived of the succour of God, Who was angry with him for the
murder, and so of there being no help for him either from earth or from heaven. Therefore
he said, “It shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me.” Scripture proves
his error in the words, “Not so;” i.e. thou shalt not be slain. For to men suffering punishment,

death is a gain, because it brings relief from their pain. But thy life shall be prolonged, that
thy punishment may be made commensurate with thy sins. Since then the word
ἐκδικούμενον may be understood in two senses; both the sin for which vengeance was taken,
and the manner of the punishment, let us now examine whether the criminal suffered a
sevenfold torment.</p>
<p>4. The seven sins of Cain have been enumerated in what has been already said. Now I
ask if the punishments inflicted on him were seven, and I state as follows. The Lord enquired
‘Where is Abel thy brother?’ not because he wished for information, but in order to give
Cain an opportunity for repentance, as is proved by the words themselves, for on his denial
the Lord immediately convicts him saying, “The voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto
me.” So the enquiry, “Where is Abel thy brother?” was not made with a view to God’s information,
but to give Cain an opportunity of perceiving his sin. But for God’s having visited
him he might have pleaded that he was left alone and had no opportunity given him for repentance.
Now the physician appeared that the patient might flee to him for help. Cain,
however, not only fails to hide his sore, but makes another one in adding the lie to the
murder. “I know not. Am I my brother’s keeper?” Now from this point begin to reckon
the punishments. “Cursed is the ground for thy sake,” one punishment. “Thou shalt till
the ground.” This is the second punishment. Some secret necessity was imposed upon him
forcing him to the tillage of the earth, so that it should never be permitted him to take rest
when he might wish, but ever to suffer pain with the earth, his enemy, which, by polluting
it with his brother’s blood, he had made accursed. “Thou shalt till the ground.” Terrible
punishment, to live with those that hate one, to have for a companion an enemy, an implacable
foe. “Thou shalt till the earth,” that is, Thou shalt toil at the labours of the field, never
resting, never released from thy work, day or night, bound down by secret necessity which
is harder than any savage master, and continually urged on to labour. “And it shall not yield
unto thee her strength.” Although the ceaseless toil had some fruit, the labour itself were
no little torture to one forced never to relax it. But the toil is ceaseless, and the labours at
the earth are fruitless (for “she did not yield her strength”) and this fruitlessness of labour
is the third punishment. “Groaning and trembling shalt thou be on the earth.” Here two
more are added to the three; continual groaning, and tremblings of the body, the limbs being
deprived of the steadiness that comes of strength. Cain had made a bad use of the strength
of his body, and so its vigour was destroyed, and it tottered and shook, and it was hard for
him to lift meat and drink to his mouth, for after his impious conduct, his wicked hand was
no longer allowed to minister to his body’s needs. Another punishment is that which Cain
disclosed when he said, “Thou hast driven me out from the face of the earth, and from thy
face shall I be hid.” What is the meaning of this driving out from the face of the earth? It
means deprivation of the benefits which are derived from the earth. He was not transferred
to another place, but he was made a stranger to all the good things of earth. “And from thy

<pb n="816"/>
face shall I be hid.” The heaviest punishment for men of good heart is alienation from God.
“And it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me.” He infers this from
what has gone before. If I am cast out of the earth, and hidden from thy face, it remains for
me to be slain of every one. What says the Lord? Not so. But he put a mark upon him.
This is the seventh punishment, that the punishment should not be hid, but that by a plain
sign proclamation should be made to all, that this is the first doer of unholy deeds. To all
who reason rightly the heaviest of punishments is shame. We have learned this also in the
case of the judgments, when “some” shall rise “to everlasting life, and some to shame and
everlasting contempt.”3153</p>
<p>5. Your next question is of a kindred character, concerning the words of Lamech to his
wives; “I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt: if Cain shall be
avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.”3154 Some suppose that Cain was
slain by Lamech, and that he survived to this generation that he might suffer a longer punishment.
But this is not the case. Lamech evidently committed two murders, from what he
says himself, “I have slain a man and a young man,” the man to his wounding, and the young
man to his hurt. There is a difference between wounding and hurt.3155 And there is a difference
between a man and a young man. “If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech
seventy and sevenfold.” It is right that I should undergo four hundred and ninety punishments,
if God’s judgment on Cain was just, that his punishments should be seven. Cain
had not learned to murder from another, and had never seen a murderer undergoing punishment.
But I, who had before my eyes Cain groaning and trembling, and the mightiness
of the wrath of God, was not made wiser by the example before me. Wherefore I deserve
to suffer four hundred and ninety punishments. There are, however, some who have gone
so far as the following explanation, which does not jar with the doctrine of the Church; from
Cain to the flood, they say, seven generations passed by, and the punishment was brought
on the whole earth, because sin was everywhere spread abroad. But the sin of Lamech requires
for its cure not a Flood, but Him Who Himself takes away the sin of the world.3156
Count the generations from Adam to the coming of Christ, and you will find, according to
the genealogy of Luke, that the Lord was born in the seventy-seventh.</p>
<p>Thus I have investigated this point to the best of my ability, though I have passed by
matters therein that might be investigated, for fear of prolonging my observations beyond
the limits of my letter. But for your intelligence little seeds are enough. “Give instruction,”

it is said, “to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser.”3157 “If a skilful man hear a wise word
he will commend it, and add unto it.”3158</p>
<p>6. About the words of Simeon to Mary, there is no obscurity or variety of interpretation.
“And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary His mother, Behold, this Child is set for
the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; (yea,
a sword shall pierce through thine own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be
revealed.”3159 Here I am astonished that, after passing by the previous words as requiring
no explanation, you should enquire about the expression, “Yea, a sword shall pierce through
thy own soul also.” To me the question, how the same child can be for the fall and rising
again, and what is the sign that shall be spoken against, does not seem less perplexing than
the question how a sword shall pierce through Mary’s heart.</p>
<p>7. My view is, that the Lord is for falling and rising again, not because some fall and
others rise again, but because in us the worst falls and the better is set up. The advent3160
of the Lord is destructive of our bodily affections and it rouses the proper qualities of the
soul. As when Paul says, “When I am weak, then I am strong,”3161 the same man is weak
and is strong, but he is weak in the flesh and strong in the spirit. Thus the Lord does not
give to some occasions of falling and to others occasions of rising. Those who fall, fall from
the station in which they once were, but it is plain that the faithless man never stands, but
is always dragged along the ground with the serpent whom he follows. He has then nowhere
to fall from, because he has already been cast down by his unbelief. Wherefore the first
boon is, that he who stands in his sin should fall and die, and then should live in righteousness
and rise, both of which graces our faith in Christ confers on us. Let the worse fall that the
better may have opportunity to rise. If fornication fall not, chastity does not rise. Unless
our unreason be crushed our reason will not come to perfection. In this sense he is for the
fall and rising again of many.</p>
<p>8. For a sign that shall be spoken against. By a sign, we properly understand in Scripture
a cross. Moses, it is said, set the serpent “upon a pole.”3162 That is upon a cross. Or else a
sign3163 is indicative of something strange and obscure seen by the simple but understood
by the intelligent. There is no cessation of controversy about the Incarnation of the Lord;
some asserting that he assumed a body, and others that his sojourn was bodiless; some that

he had a passible body, and others that he fulfilled the bodily oeconomy by a kind of appearance.
Some say that his body was earthly, some that it was heavenly; some that He pre-existed
before the ages; some that He took His beginning from Mary. It is on this account
that He is a sign that shall be spoken against.</p>
<p>9. By a sword is meant the word which tries and judges our thoughts, which pierces
even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner
of our thoughts.3164 Now every soul in the hour of the Passion was subjected, as it
were, to a kind of searching. According to the word of the Lord it is said, “All ye shall be
offended because of me.”3165 Simeon therefore prophesies about Mary herself, that when
standing by the cross, and beholding what is being done, and hearing the voices, after the
witness of Gabriel, after her secret knowledge of the divine conception, after the great exhibition
of miracles, she shall feel about her soul a mighty tempest.3166 The Lord was bound
to taste of death for every man—to become a propitiation for the world and to justify all
men by His own blood. Even thou thyself, who hast been taught from on high the things
concerning the Lord, shalt be reached by some doubt. This is the sword. “That the thoughts
of many hearts may be revealed.” He indicates that after the offence at the Cross of Christ
a certain swift healing shall come from the Lord to the disciples and to Mary herself, confirming
their heart in faith in Him. In the same way we saw Peter, after he had been offended,
holding more firmly to his faith in Christ. What was human in him was proved unsound,
that the power of the Lord might be shewn.</p>

<p>2. If, then, the sojourn of the Lord in flesh has never taken place, the Redeemer3174
paid not the fine to death on our behalf, nor through Himself destroyed death’s reign. For
if what was reigned over by death was not that which was assumed by the Lord, death would
not have ceased working his own ends, nor would the sufferings of the God-bearing flesh
have been made our gain; He would not have killed sin in the flesh: we who had died in
Adam should not have been made alive in Christ; the fallen to pieces would not have been
framed again; the shattered would not have been set up again; that which by the serpent’s
trick had been estranged from God would never have been made once more His own. All
these boons are undone by those that assert that it was with a heavenly body that the Lord
came among us. And if the God-bearing flesh was not ordained to be assumed of the lump
of Adam, what need was there of the Holy Virgin? But who has the hardihood now once
again to renew by the help of sophistical arguments and, of course, by scriptural evidence,
that old dogma3175 of Valentinus, now long ago silenced? For this impious doctrine of the

after tearing off a few of the Apostle’s statements, constructed for himself this impious fabrication,
asserting that the Lord assumed the “form of a servant,”3177 and not the servant
himself, and that He was made in the “likeness,” but that actual manhood was not assumed
by Him. Similar sentiments are expressed by these men who can only be pitied for bringing

derived from Achamoth; (3) He had a body, but not a material body, but a heavenly one.…(4) The pre-existent
Saviour descended on Him in the form of a dove at His Baptism. When our Lord was brought before Pilate,
this Saviour as being incapable of suffering withdrew His power;” (cf. the Gospel of Peter, “The Lord cried, saying,
‘My Power, my Power, Thou hast left me.’”) “and the spiritual part which was also impassible was likewise dismissed;
the animal soul and the wonderfully contrived body alone remaining to suffer, and to exhibit on the
cross on earth a representation of what had previously taken place on the heavenly Stauros. It thus appears that
Valentinus was only partially docetic.” But cf. Iren. v. 1, 2, and iii. 22.</note>

<p>3. As to the statement that human feelings are transmitted to the actual Godhead, it is
one made by men who preserve no order in their thoughts, and are ignorant that there is a
distinction between the feelings of flesh, of flesh endowed with soul, and of soul using a
body.3179 It is the property of flesh to undergo division, diminution, dissolution; of flesh
endowed with soul to feel weariness, pain, hunger, thirst, and to be overcome by sleep; of
soul using body to feel grief, heaviness, anxiety, and such like. Of these some are natural
and necessary to every living creature; others come of evil will, and are superinduced because
of life’s lacking proper discipline and training for virtue. Hence it is evident that our Lord
assumed the natural affections to establish His real incarnation, and not by way of semblance
of incantation, and that all the affections derived from evil that besmirch the purity of our
life, He rejected as unworthy of His unsullied Godhead. It is on this account that He is said
to have been “made in the likeness of flesh of sin;”3180 not, as these men hold, in likeness
of flesh, but of flesh of sin. It follows that He took our flesh with its natural afflictions, but
“did no sin.”3181 Just as the death which is in the flesh, transmitted to us through Adam,
was swallowed up by the Godhead, so was the sin taken away by the righteousness which is
in Christ Jesus,3182 so that in the resurrection we receive back the flesh neither liable to
death nor subject to sin.</p>
<p>These, brethren, are the mysteries of the Church; these are the traditions of the Fathers.
Every man who fears the Lord, and is awaiting God’s judgment, I charge not to be carried
away by various doctrines. If any one teaches a different doctrine, and refuses to accede to
the sound words of the faith, rejecting the oracles of the Spirit, and making his own teaching
of more authority than the lessons of the Gospels, of such an one beware. May the Lord
grant that one day we may meet, so that all that my argument has let slip I may supply when
we stand face to face! I have written little when there was much to say, for I did not like to
go beyond my letter’s bounds. At the same time I do not doubt that to all that fear the Lord
a brief reminder is enough.</p>

<head>Letter CCLXII.3183</head>
<p>To the Monk Urbicius.3184</p>
<p>1. You have done well to write to me. You have shewn how great is the fruit of charity.
Continue so to do. Do not think that, when you write to me, you need offer excuses. I recognise
my own position, and I know that by nature every man is of equal honour with the
rest. Whatever excellence there is in me is not of family, nor of superfluous wealth, nor of
physical condition; it comes only of superiority in the fear of God. What, then, hinders you
from fearing the Lord yet more, and so, in this respect, being greater than I am? Write often
to me, and acquaint me with the condition of the brotherhood with you. Tell me what
members of the Church in your parts are sound, that I may know to whom I ought to write,
and in whom I may confide. I am told that there are some who are endeavouring to deprave
the right doctrine of the Lord’s incarnation by perverse opinions, and I therefore call upon
them through you to hold off from those unreasonable views, which some are reported to
me to hold. I mean that God Himself was turned into flesh; that He did not assume, through
the Holy Mary, the nature3185 of Adam, but, in His own proper Godhead, was changed into
a material nature.3186</p>
<p>2. This absurd position can be easily confuted. The blasphemy is its own conviction,
and I therefore think that, for one who fears the Lord, the mere reminder is enough. If He
was turned, then He was changed. But far be it from me to say or think such a thing, when
God has declared, “I am the Lord, I change not.”3187 Moreover, how could the benefit of
the incarnation be conveyed to us, unless our body, joined to the Godhead, was made superior
to the dominion of death? If He was changed, He no longer constituted a proper body,
such as subsisted after the combination with it of the divine body.3188 But how, if all the
nature of the Only-begotten was changed, could the incomprehensible Godhead be circumscribed
within the limit of the mass of a little body? I am sure that no one who is in his

<head>Letter CCLXIII.3189</head>
<p>To the Westerns.</p>
<p>1. May the Lord God, in Whom we have put our trust, give to each of you grace sufficient
to enable you to realize your hope, in proportion to the joy wherewith you have filled my
heart, both by the letter which you have sent me by the hands of the well-beloved fellowpresbyters,
and by the sympathy which you have felt for me in my distress, like men who
have put on bowels of mercy,3190 as you have been described to me by the presbyters aforementioned.
Although my wounds remain the same, nevertheless it does bring alleviation
to me that I should have leeches at hand, able, should they find an opportunity, to apply
rapid remedies to my hurts. Wherefore in return I salute you by our beloved friends, and
exhort you, if the Lord puts it into your power to come to me, not to hesitate to visit me.
For part of the greatest commandment is the visitation of the sick. But if the good God and
wise Dispenser of our lives reserves this boon for another season, at all events write to me
whatever it is proper for you to write for the consolation of the oppressed and the lifting up
of those that are crushed down. Already the Church has suffered many severe blows, and
great has been my affliction at them. Nowhere is there expectation of succour unless the
Lord sends us a remedy by you who are his true servants.</p>
<p>2. The bold and shameless heresy of the Arians, after being publicly cut off from the
body of the Church, still abides in its own error, and does not do us much harm because its
impiety is notorious to all. Nevertheless men clad in sheep’s clothing, and presenting a mild
and amiable appearance, but within unsparingly ravaging Christ’s flocks, find it easy to do
hurt to the simpler ones, because they came out from us. It is these who are grievous and
hard to guard against. It is these that we implore your diligence to denounce publicly to all
the Churches of the East; to the end that they may either turn to the right way and join with
us in genuine alliance, or, if they abide in their perversity, may keep their mischief to
themselves alone, and be unable to communicate their own plague to their neighbours by
unguarded communion. I am constrained to mention them by name, in order that you
may yourselves recognise those who are stirring up disturbance here, and may make them
known to our Churches. My own words are suspected by most men, as though I had an ill
will towards them on account of some private quarrel. You, however, have all the more
credit with the people, in proportion to the distance that separates your home from theirs,
besides the fact that you are gifted with God’s grace to help those who are distressed. If
more of you concur in uttering the same opinions, it is clear that the number of those who
have expressed them will make it impossible to oppose their acceptance.</p>

<p>3. One of those who have caused me great sorrow is Eustathius of Sebasteia in Lesser
Armenia; formerly a disciple of Arius, and a follower of him at the time when he flourished
in Alexandria, and concocted his infamous blasphemies against the Only-begotten, he was
numbered among his most faithful disciples. On his return to his own country he submitted
a confession of the sound faith to Hermogenes, the very blessed Bishop of Cæsarea, who
was on the point of condemning him for false doctrine. Under these circumstances he was
ordained by Hermogenes, and, on the death of that bishop, hastened to Eusebius of Constantinople,
who himself yielded to none in the energy of his support of the impious doctrine
of Arius. From Constantinople he was expelled for some reason or another, returned to his
own country and a second time made his defence, attempting to conceal his impious sentiments
and cloking them under a certain verbal orthodoxy. He no sooner obtained the rank
of bishop than he straightway appeared writing an anathema on the Homoousion in the
Arians’ synod at Ancyra.3191 From thence he went to Seleucia and took part in the notorious
measures of his fellow heretics. At Constantinople he assented a second time to the propositions
of the heretics. On being ejected from his episcopate, on the ground of his former
deposition at Melitine,3192 he hit upon a journey to you as a means of restitution for himself.
What propositions were made to him by the blessed bishop Liberius, and to what he agreed,
I am ignorant. I only know that he brought a letter restoring him, which he shewed to the
synod at Tyana, and was restored to his see. He is now defaming the very creed for which
he was received; he is consorting with those who are anathematizing the Homoousion, and
is prime leader of the heresy of the pneumatomachi. As it is from the west that he derives
his power to injure the Churches, and uses the authority given him by you to the overthrow
of the many, it is necessary that his correction should come from the same quarter, and that
a letter be sent to the Churches stating on what terms he was received, and in what manner
he has changed his conduct and nullifies the favour given him by the Fathers at that time.</p>
<p>4. Next comes Apollinarius, who is no less a cause of sorrow to the Churches. With
his facility of writing, and a tongue ready to argue on any subject, he has filled the world
with his works, in disregard of the advice of him who said, “Beware of making many
books.”3193 In their multitude there are certainly many errors. How is it possible to avoid
sin in a multitude of words?3194 And the theological works of Apollinarius are founded on
Scriptural proof, but are based on a human origin. He has written about the resurrection,
from a mythical, or rather Jewish, point of view; urging that we shall return again to the

worship of the Law, be circumcised, keep the Sabbath, abstain from meats, offer sacrifices
to God, worship in the Temple at Jerusalem, and be altogether turned from Christians into
Jews. What could be more ridiculous? Or, rather, what could be more contrary to the
doctrines of the Gospel? Then, further, he has made such confusion among the brethren
about the incarnation, that few of his readers preserve the old mark of true religion; but the
more part, in their eagerness for novelty, have been diverted into investigations and quarrelsome
discussions of his unprofitable treatises.</p>
<p>5. As to whether there is anything objectionable about the conversation of Paulinus,
you can say yourselves. What distresses me is that he should shew an inclination for the
doctrine of Marcellus, and unreservedly admit his followers to communion. You know,
most honourable brethren, that the reversal of all our hope is involved in the doctrine of
Marcellus, for it does not confess the Son in His proper hypostasis, but represents Him as
having been sent forth, and as having again returned to Him from Whom He came; neither
does it admit that the Paraclete has His own subsistence. It follows that no one could be
wrong in declaring this heresy to be all at variance with Christianity, and in styling it a corrupt
Judaism. Of these things I implore you to take due heed. This will be the case if you will
consent to write to all the Churches of the East that those who have perverted these doctrines
are in communion with you, if they amend; but that if they contentiously determine to abide
by their innovations, you are separated from them. I am myself well aware, that it had been
fitting for me to treat of these matters, sitting in synod with you in common deliberation.
But this the time does not allow. Delay is dangerous, for the mischief they have caused has
taken root. I have therefore been constrained to dispatch these brethren, that you may learn
from them all that has been omitted in my letter, and that they may rouse you to afford the
succour which we pray for to the Churches of the East.</p>

<p>To Barses the bishop, truly God-beloved and worthy of all reverence and honour, Basil
sends greeting in the Lord. As my dear brother Domninus3197 is setting out to you, I gladly
seize the opportunity of writing, and I greet you by him, praying the holy God that we may
be so long preserved in this life as to be permitted to see you, and to enjoy the good gifts
which you possess. Only pray, I beseech you, that the Lord may not deliver us for aye to
the enemies of the Cross of Christ, but that He will keep His Churches, until the time of
that peace which the just Judge Himself knows when He will bestow. For He will bestow
it. He will not always abandon us. As He limited seventy years3198 for the period of captivity
for the Israelites in punishment for their sins, so peradventure the Mighty One, after giving
us up for some appointed time, will recall us once again, and will restore us to the peace of
the beginning—unless indeed the apostasy is now nigh at hand, and the events that have
lately happened are the beginnings of the approach of Antichrist. If this be so, pray that the
good Lord will either take away our afflictions, or preserve us through our afflictions unvanquished.
Through you I greet all those who have been thought worthy to be associated with
you. All who are with me salute your reverence. May you, by the grace of the Holy One,
be preserved to the Church of God in good health, trusting in the Lord, and praying for me.</p>

<head>Letter CCLXV.3199</head>
<p>To Eulogius, Alexander, and Harpocration, bishops of Egypt, in exile.</p>
<p>1. In all things we find that the providence exercised by our good God over His Churches
is mighty, and that thus the very things which seem to be gloomy, and do not turn out as
we should like, are ordained for the advantage of most, in the hidden wisdom of God, and
in the unsearchable judgments of His righteousness. Now the Lord has removed you from
the regions of Egypt, and has brought you and established you in the midst of Palestine,
after the manner of Israel of old, whom He carried away by captivity into the land of the
Assyrians, and there extinguished idolatry through the sojourn of His saints. Now too we
find the same thing, when we observe that the Lord is making known your struggle for the
sake of true religion, opening to you through your exile the arena of your blessed contests,
and to all who see before them your noble constancy, giving the boon of your good example
to lead them to salvation. By God’s grace, I have heard of the correctness of your faith, and
of your zeal for the brethren and that it is in no careless or perfunctory spirit that you provide
what is profitable and necessary for salvation, and that you support all that conduces to the
edification of the Churches. I have therefore thought it right that I should be brought into
communion with your goodness, and be united to your reverences by letter. For these
reasons I have sent my very dear brother the deacon Elpidius, who not only conveys my
letter, but is moreover fully qualified to announce to you whatever may have been omitted
in my letter.</p>
<p>2. I have been specially moved to desire union with you by the report of the zeal of your
reverences in the cause of orthodoxy. The constancy of your hearts has been stirred neither
by multiplicity of books nor by variety of ingenious arguments. You have on the contrary,
recognised those who endeavoured to introduce innovations in opposition to the apostolic
doctrines, and you have refused to keep silence concerning the mischief which they are
causing. I have in truth found great distress among all who cleave to the peace of the Lord
at the divers innovations of Apollinarius of Laodicea. He has all the more distressed me
from the fact that he seemed at the beginning on our side. A sufferer can in a certain sense
endure what comes to him from an open enemy, even though it be exceedingly painful, as
it is written, “For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it.”3200
But it is intolerable, and beyond the power of comfort, to be wronged by a close and sympathetic
friend. Now that very man whom I have expected to have at my right hand in defence
of the truth, I have found in many ways hindering those who are being saved, by seducing
their minds and drawing them away from direct doctrine. What rash and hasty deed

has he not done? What ill considered and dangerous argument has he not risked? Is not
all the Church divided against herself, specially since the day when men have been sent by
him to the Churches governed by orthodox bishops, to rend them asunder and to set up
some peculiar and illegal service? Is not ridicule brought upon the great mystery of true
religion when bishops go about without people and clergy, having nothing but the mere
name and title, and effecting nothing for the advancement of the Gospel of peace and salvation?
Are not his discourses about God full of impious doctrines, the old impiety of the insane
Sabellius being now renewed by him in his writings? For if the works which are current
among the Sebastenes are not the forgery of foes, and are really his composition, he has
reached a height of impiety which cannot be surpassed, in saying that Father, Son, and
Spirit are the same, and other dark pieces of irreverence which I have declined even to hear,
praying that I may have nothing to do with those who have uttered them. Does he not
confuse the doctrine of the incarnation? Has not the oeconomy of salvation been made
doubtful to the many on account of his dark and cloudy speculations about it? To collect
them all, and refute them, requires long time and much discussion. But where have the
promises of the Gospel been blunted and destroyed as by his figments? So meanly and
poorly has he dared to explain the blessed hope laid up for all who live according to the
Gospel of Christ, as to reduce it to mere old wives’ fables and doctrines of Jews. He proclaims
the renewal of the Temple, the observance of the worship of the Law, a typical high priest
over again after the real High Priest, and a sacrifice for sins after the Lamb of God Who
taketh away the sin of the world.3201 He preaches partial baptisms after the one baptism,
and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the Church which, through its faith in Christ, has not
spot or wrinkle, or any such thing;3202 cleansing of leprosy after the painless state of the
resurrection; an offering of jealousy3203 when they neither marry nor are given in marriage;
shew-bread after the Bread from heaven; burning lamps after the true Light. In a word, if
the law of the Commandments has been done away with by dogmas, it is plain that under
these circumstances the dogmas of Christ will be nullified by the injunctions of the law.3204
At these things shame and disgrace have covered my face,3205 and heavy grief hath filled
my heart. Wherefore, I beseech you, as skilful physicians, and instructed how to discipline
antagonists with gentleness, to try and bring him back to the right order of the Church, and

in order that you may decide nothing in their case rashly or inconsiderately. On account
of his impious doctrines he has gone out from the Church.3207 It is therefore necessary
that his followers should only be received into communion on condition that they anathematize
that heresy, in order that those who are united to me through you may be accepted by
all the brethren. And now most men are moved to no small grief on hearing that you have
both received them and admitted them to ecclesiastical communion on their coming to
your excellency. Nevertheless you ought to have known that by God’s grace you do not
stand alone in the East, but have many in communion with you, who vindicate the orthodoxy
of the Fathers, and who put forth the pious doctrine of the Faith at Nicæa. The Westerns
also all agree with you and with me, whose exposition of the Faith I have received and keep
with me, assenting to their sound doctrine. You ought, then, to have satisfied all who are
in agreement with you, that the action which is being taken may be ratified by the general
consent, and that peace may not be broken by the acceptance of some while others are kept
apart. Thus you ought to have at the same time seriously and gently taken counsel about
matters which are of importance to all the Churches throughout the world. Praise is not
due to him who hastily determines any point, but rather to him who rules every detail firmly

<p>To Petrus, bishop of Alexandria.3210</p>
<p>1. You have very properly rebuked me, and in a manner becoming a spiritual brother
who has been taught genuine love by the Lord, because I am not giving you exact and detailed
information of all that is going on here, for it is both your part to be interested in what
concerns me, and mine to tell you all that concerns myself. But I must tell you, right honourable
and well-beloved brother, that our continuous afflictions, and this mighty agitation
which is now shaking the Churches, result in my taking all that is happening as a matter of
course. Just as in smithies where men whose ears are deafened get accustomed to the sound,
so by the frequency of the strange tidings that reach me I have now grown accustomed to
be undisturbed and undismayed at extraordinary events. So the policy which has been for
a long time pursued by the Arians to the detriment of the Church, although their achievements
have been many and great and noised abroad through all the world, has nevertheless
been endurable to me, because of their being the work of open foes and enemies of the word
of truth. It is when these men do something unusual that I am astonished, not when they
attempt something great and audacious against true religion. But I am grieved and troubled
at what is being done by men who feel and think with me. Yet their doings are so frequent
and so constantly reported to me, that even they do not appear surprising. So it comes about
that I was not agitated at the recent disorderly proceedings, partly because I knew perfectly
well that common report would carry them to you without my help, and partly because I
preferred to wait for somebody else to give you disagreeable news. And yet, further, I did
not think it reasonable that I should show indignation at such proceedings, as though I were
annoyed at suffering a slight. To the actual agents in the matter I have written in becoming
terms, exhorting them, because of the dissension arising among some of the brethren there,
not to fall away from charity, but to wait for the matter to be set right by those who have
authority to remedy disorders in due ecclesiastical form. That you should have so acted,
stirred by honourable and becoming motives, calls for my commendation, and moves my
gratitude to the Lord that there remains preserved in you a relic of the ancient discipline,
and that the Church has not lost her own might in my persecution. The canons have not
suffered persecution as well as I. Though importuned again by the Galatians, I was never
able to give them an answer, because I waited for your decision. Now, if the Lord so will
and they will consent to listen to me, I hope that I shall be able to bring the people to the
Church. It cannot then be cast in my teeth that I have gone over to the Marcellians, and
they on the contrary will become limbs of the body of the Church of Christ. Thus the disgrace

caused by heresy will be made to disappear by the method I adopt, and I shall escape the
opprobrium of having gone over to them.</p>
<p>2. I have also been grieved by our brother Dorotheus, because, as he has himself written,
he has not gently and mildly reported everything to your excellency. I set this down to the
difficulty of the times. I seem to be deprived by my sins of all success in my undertakings,
if indeed the best of my brethren are proved ill-disposed and incompetent, by their failure
to perform their duties in accordance with my wishes. On his return Dorotheus reported
to me the conversation which he had had with your excellency in the presence of the very
venerable bishop Damasus, and he caused me distress by saying that our God-beloved
brethren and fellow-ministers, Meletius and Eusebius, had been reckoned among the
Ariomaniacs.3211 If their orthodoxy were established by nothing else, the attacks made
upon them by the Arians are, to the minds of all right thinking people, no small proof of
their rectitude. Even your participation with them in sufferings endured for Christ’s sake
ought to unite your reverence to them in love. Be assured of this, right honourable sir, that
there is no word of orthodoxy which has not been proclaimed by these men with all boldness.
God is my witness. I have heard them myself. I should not certainly have now admitted
them to communion, if I had caught them tripping in the faith. But, if it seem good to you,
let us leave the past alone. Let us make a peaceful start for the future. For we have need
one of another in the fellowship of the members, and specially now, when the Churches of
the East are looking to us, and will take your agreement as a pledge of strength and consolidation.
If, on the other hand, they perceive that you are in a state of mutual suspicion, they
will drop their hands, and slacken in their resistance to the enemies of the faith.3212</p>

you, my dear friend, in person, and to glorify the Lord Who is magnified in you, and has
made your honourable old age renowned among all them that fear Him throughout the

righteousness. I have not written often, not even so often as I ought, but I have written to
your reverence. Possibly the brethren to whom I committed my greetings were not able to
preserve them. But now that I have found some of my brethren travelling to your excellency,
I have readily entrusted my letter to them, and I have sent some messages which I beg you

Isaac.3214 I have been much occupied, and have had my mind drowned in a multiplicity of
cares. So it may well be that I have omitted something which I ought to have said. If so, do
not reckon it against me; and do not be grieved. Act in all things up to your own high

<p>To Eusebius, in exile.</p>
<p>Even in our time the Lord has taught us, by protecting with His great and powerful
hand the life of your holiness, that He does not abandon His holy ones. I reckon your case
to be almost like that of the saint remaining unhurt in the belly of the monster of the deep,
or that of the men who feared the Lord, living unscathed in the fierce fire. For though the
war is round about you on every side, He, as I hear, has kept you unharmed. May the mighty
God keep you, if I live longer, to fulfil my earnest prayer that I may see you! If not for me,
may He keep you for the rest, who wait for your return as they might for their own salvation.
I am persuaded that the Lord in His loving-kindness will give heed to the tears of the
Churches, and to the sighs which all are heaving over you, and will preserve you in life until
He grant the prayer of all who night and day are praying to Him. Of all the measures taken
against you, up to the arrival of our beloved brother Libanius the deacon,3216 I have been
sufficiently informed by him while on his way. I am anxious to learn what happened afterwards.
I hear that in the meanwhile still greater troubles have occurred where you are; about
all this, sooner if possible, but, if not, at least by our reverend brother Paul the presbyter,
on his return, may I learn, as I pray that I may, that your life is preserved safe and sound.
But on account of the report that all the roads are infested with thieves and deserters,3217 I
have been afraid to entrust anything to the brother’s keeping, for fear of causing his death.
If the Lord grant a little quiet, (as I am told of the coming of the army), I will try to send
you one of my own men, to visit you, to bring me back news of everything about you.</p>

<head>Letter CCLXIX.3218</head>
<p>To the wife of Arinthæus, the General. Consolatory.</p>
<p>1. It had been only proper, and due to your affection, that I should have been on the
spot, and have taken part in the present occurrences. Thus I might have at once assuaged
my own sorrow, and given some consolation to your excellency. But my body will no longer
endure long journeys, and so I am driven to approach you by letter, that I seem not to count
what has happened as altogether of no interest to me. Who has not mourned for that man?
Who is so stony of heart as not to have shed a warm tear over him? I especially have been
filled with mourning at the thought of all the marks of respect which I have received from
him, and of the general protection which he has extended to the Churches of God. Nevertheless,
I have bethought me that he was human, and had done the work he had to do in
this life, and now in the appointed time has been taken back again by God Who ordains our
lots. All this, I beseech you, in your wisdom, to take to heart, and to meet the event with
meekness, and, so far as is possible, to endure your loss with moderation. Time may be able
to soothe your heart, and allow the approach of reason. At the same time your great love
for your husband, and your goodness to all, lead me to fear that, from the very simplicity
of your character, the wound of your grief may pierce you deeply, and that you may give
yourself up entirely to your feelings. The teaching of Scripture is always useful, and specially
at times like this. Remember, then, the sentence passed by our Creator. By it all we who
are dust shall return to dust.3219 No one is so great as to be superior to dissolution.</p>
<p>2. Your admirable husband was a good and great man, and his bodily strength rivalled
the virtues of his soul. He was unsurpassed, I must own, in both respects. But he was human,
and he is dead; like Adam, like Abel, like Noah, like Abraham, like Moses, or any one else
of like nature that you can name. Let us not then complain because he has been taken from
us. Let us rather thank Him, who joined us to him, that we dwelt with him from the beginning.
To lose a husband is a lot which you share with other women; but to have been united
to such a husband is a boast which I do not think any other woman can make. In truth our
Creator fashioned that man for us as a model of what human nature ought to be. All eyes
were attracted towards him, and every tongue told of his deeds. Painters and sculptors fell
short of his excellence, and historians, when they tell the story of his achievements in war,
seem to fall into the region of the mythical and the incredible. Thus it has come about that
most men have not even been able to give credit to the report conveying the sad tidings, or
to accept the truth of the news that Arinthæus is dead. Nevertheless Arinthæus has suffered
what will happen to heaven and to sun and to earth. He has died a bright death; not bowed

down by old age; without losing one whit of his honour; great in this life; great in the life to
come; deprived of nothing of his present splendour in view of the glory hoped for, because
he washed away all the stain of his soul, in the very moment of his departure hence, in the
laver of regeneration. That you should have arranged and joined in this rite is cause of supreme
consolation. Turn now your thoughts from the present to the future, that you may
be worthy through good works to obtain a place of rest like his. Spare an aged mother; spare
a tender daughter, to whom you are now the sole comfort. Be an example of fortitude to
other women, and so regulate your grief that you may neither eject it from your heart, nor
be overwhelmed by your distress. Ever keep your eyes fixed on the great reward of patience,
promised, as the requital of the deeds of this life, by our Lord Jesus Christ.3220</p>

<p>Without Address. Concerning Raptus.3222</p>
<p>I am distressed to find that you are by no means indignant at the sins forbidden, and
that you seem incapable of understanding, how this raptus, which has been committed, is
an act of unlawfulness and tyranny against society and human nature, and an outrage on
free men. I am sure that if you had all been of one mind in this matter, there would have
been nothing to prevent this bad custom from being long ago driven out of your country.
Do thou at the present time shew the zeal of a Christian man, and be moved as the wrong
deserves. Wherever you find the girl, insist on taking her away, and restore her to her parents,
shut out the man from the prayers, and make him excommunicate. His accomplices, according
to the canon3223 which I have already put forth, cut off, with all their household,
from the prayers. The village which received the girl after the abduction, and kept her, or
even fought against her restitution, shut out with all its inhabitants from the prayers; to the
end that all may know that we regard the ravisher as a common foe, like a snake or any
other wild beast, and so hunt him out, and help those whom he has wronged.</p>

<head>Letter CCLXXI.3224</head>
<p>To Eusebius,3225 my comrade, to recommend Cyriacus the presbyter.</p>
<p>At once and in haste, after your departure, I came to the town. Why need I tell a man
not needing to be told, because he knows by experience, how distressed I was not to find
you? How delightful it would have been to me to see once more the excellent Eusebius, to
embrace him, to travel once again in memory to our young days, and to be reminded of old
times when for both of us there was one home, one hearth, the same schoolmaster, the same
leisure, the same work, the same treats, the same hardships, and everything shared in common!
What do you think I would not have given to recall all this by actually meeting you,
to rid me of the heavy weight of my old age, and to seem to be turned from an old man into
a lad again? But I have lost this pleasure. At least of the privilege of meeting your excellency
in correspondence, and of consoling myself by the best means at my disposal, I am not deprived.
I am so fortunate as to meet the very reverend presbyter Cyriacus. I am ashamed
to recommend him to you, and to make him, through me, your own, lest I seem to be performing
a superfluous task in offering to you what you already possess and value as your
own. But it is my duty to witness to the truth, and to give the best boons I have to those
who are spiritually united to me. I think that the man’s blamelessness in his sacred position
is well known to you; but I confirm it, for I do not know that any charge is brought against
him by those who do not fear the Lord and are laying their hands upon all. Even if they had
done anything of the kind, the man would not have been unworthy, for the enemies of the
Lord rather vindicate the orders of those whom they attack than deprive them of any of the
grace given them by the Spirit. However, as I said, nothing has even been thought of against
the man. Be so good then as to look upon him as a blameless presbyter, in union with me,
and worthy of all reverence. Thus will you benefit yourself and gratify me.</p>

<head>Letter CCLXXII.3226</head>
<p>To Sophronius the magister officiorum.3227</p>
<p>1. It has been reported to me by Actiacus the deacon, that certain men have moved you
to anger against me, by falsely stating me to be ill-disposed towards your excellency. I cannot
be astonished at a man in your position being followed by certain sycophants. High position
seems to be in some way naturally attended by miserable hangers-on of this kind. Destitute
as they are of any good quality of their own whereby they may be known, they endeavour
to recommend themselves by means of other people’s ills. Peradventure, just as mildew is
a blight which grows in corn, so flattery stealing upon friendship is a blight of friendship.
So, as I said, I am by no means astonished that these men should buzz about your bright
and distinguished hearth, as drones do about the hives. But what has moved my wonderment,
and has seemed altogether astounding, is that a man like yourself, specially distinguished
by the seriousness of your character, should have been induced to give both your ears to
these people and to accept their calumny against me. From my youth up to this my old age
I have felt affection for many men, but I am not aware that I have ever felt greater affection
for any one than for your excellency. Even had not my reason induced me to regard a man
of such a character, our intimacy from boyhood would have sufficed to attach me to your
soul. You know yourself how much custom has to do with friendship. Pardon my deficiency,
if I can show nothing worthy of this preference. You will not ask some deed from me in
proof of my good will; you will be satisfied with a temper of mind which assuredly prays
for you that you may have all that is best. May your fortunes never fall so low, as that you
should need the aid of any one so insignificant as myself!</p>
<p>2. How then was I likely to say anything against you, or to take any action in the matter
of Memnonius? These points were reported to me by the deacon. How could I put the
wealth of Hymetius before the friendship of one so prodigal of his substance as you are?
There is no truth in any of these things. I have neither said nor done anything against you.
Possibly some ground may have been given for some of the lies that are being told, by my
remarking to some of those who are causing disturbance, “If the man has determined to
accomplish what he has in mind, then, whether you make disturbance or not, what he means
to be done will certainly be done. You will speak, or hold your tongues; it will make no
difference. If he changes his mind, beware how you defame my friend’s honourable name.
Do not, under the pretence of zeal in your patron’s cause, attempt to make some personal
profit out of your attempts to threaten and alarm.” As to that person’s making his will, I
have never said one word, great or small, directly or indirectly, about the matter.</p>

character, who thinks nothing of the great sin of lying. Put away all suspicion of me in relation
to the business, and for the future reckon my affection for you as beyond the reach of
all calumny. Imitate Alexander, who received a letter, saying that his physician was plotting
his death, at the very moment when he was just about to drink his medicine, and was so far
from believing the slanderer that he at one and the same time read the letter and drank the
draught.3228 I refuse to admit that I am in any way inferior to the men who have been
famous for their friendship, for I have never been detected in any breach of mine; and, besides
this, I have received from my God the commandment of love, and owe you love not only
as part of mankind in general, but because I recognise you individually as a benefactor both
of my country and of myself.</p>

<p>To the great Harmatius.</p>
<p>The common law of human nature makes elders fathers to youngsters, and the special

not, then, think that I am impertinent or shew myself indefensibly meddlesome, if I plead
with you on behalf of your son. In other respects I think it only right that you should exact
obedience from him; for, so far as his body is concerned, he is subject to you, both by the
law of nature, and by the civil law under which we live. His soul, however, is derived from
a diviner source, and may properly be held to be subject to another authority. The debts
which it owes to God have a higher claim than any others. Since, then, he has preferred the
God of us Christians, the true God, to your many gods which are worshipped by the help
of material symbols, be not angry with him. Rather admire his noble firmness of soul, in
sacrificing the fear and respect due to his father to close conjunction with God, through
true knowledge and a life of virtue. Nature herself will move you, as well as your invariable
gentleness and kindliness of disposition, not to allow yourself to feel angry with him even
to a small extent. And I am sure that you will not set my mediation at naught,—or rather,
I should say, the mediation of your townsmen of which I am the exponent. They all love
you so well, and pray so earnestly for all blessings for you, that they suppose that in you they
have welcomed a Christian too. So overjoyed have they been at the report which has suddenly

<p>To the learned Maximus.</p>
<p>The excellent Theotecnus has given mean account of your highness, whereby he has
inspired me with a longing for your acquaintance, so clearly do his words delineate the
character of your mind. He has enkindled in me so ardent an affection for you, that were
it not that I am weighed down with age, that I am the victim of a congenital ailment, that I
am bound hand and foot by the numberless cares of the Church, nothing would have
hindered my coming to you. For indeed it is no small gain that a member of a great house,
a man of illustrious lineage, in adopting the life of the gospel, should bridle the propensities
of youth by reflection, and subject to reason the affections of the flesh; should display a humility
consistent with his Christian profession, bethinking himself, as is his duty, whence
he is come and whither he is going. For it is this consideration of our nature that reduces
the swelling of the mind, and banishes all boastfulness and arrogance. In a word it renders
one a disciple of our Lord, Who said, “Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.”3234
And in truth, very dear son, the only thing that deserves our exertions and praises is our
everlasting welfare; and this is the honour that comes from God.</p>
<p>Human affairs are fainter than a shadow; more deceitful than a dream. Youth fades
more quickly than the flowers of spring; our beauty wastes with age or sickness. Riches are
uncertain; glory is fickle. The pursuit of arts and sciences is bounded by the present life;
the charm of eloquence, which all covet, reaches but the ear: whereas the practice of virtue
is a precious possession for its owner, a delightful spectacle for all who witness it. Make this
your study; so will you be worthy of the good things promised by the Lord.</p>
<p>But a recital of the means whereby to make the acquisition, and secure the enjoyment
of these blessings, lies beyond the intention of this present letter. Thus much however, after
what I heard from my brother Theotecnus, it occurred to me to write to you. I pray that he
may always speak the truth, especially in his accounts of you; that the Lord may be the more
glorified in you, abounding as you do in the most precious fruits of piety, although derived
from a foreign root.</p>

<p>Although so numerous are my letters, conveyed to your excellency by as many bearers,
yet, having regard to the especial honour you have shewn me, I cannot think that their large
number causes you any annoyance.</p>
<p>I do not hesitate therefore to entrust to this brother the accompanying letter: I know
that he will meet with all that he wishes, and that you will count me but as a benefactor in
furnishing occasion for the gratification of your kind inclinations. He craves your advocacy.
His cause he will explain in person, if you but deign to regard him with a favourable eye,
and embolden him to speak freely in the presence of so august an authority. Accept my
assurance that any kindness shewn to him, I shall regard as personal to myself. His special
reason for leaving Tyana and coming to me was the high value he attached to the presentation
of a letter written by myself in support of his application. That he may not be disappointed
of his hope; that I may continue in the enjoyment of your consideration; that your interest
in all that is good may, in this present matter, find scope for its full exercise—are the grounds
on which I crave a gracious reception for him, and a place amongst those nearest to you.</p>

future claims, and distributing the rest among the present applicants.</p>
<p>As for the offenders,—that they be corrected in the discipline and admonition of the

think myself well off to be quickly rid of him. I have often known him twist round his accusations
upon his accusers. In a word, there is no creature living upon earth so subtile and
versatile in villainy. A slight acquaintance with him suffices to prove this. Why then do
you appeal to me? Why not at once bring yourselves to submit to his ill-treatment, as to a

<head>Letter CCLXXXVIII.3248</head>
<p>Without address. Excommunicatory.</p>
<p>When public punishment fails to bring a man to his senses, or exclusion from the
prayers of the Church to drive him to repentance, it only remains to treat him in accordance
with our Lord’s directions—as it is written, “If thy brother shall trespass against thee….tell
him his fault between thee and him;…if he will not hear thee, take with thee another;” “and
if he shall” then “neglect to hear, tell it unto the Church; but if he neglect to hear even the
Church, let him be unto thee henceforth as an heathen man, and as a publican.”3249 Now
all this we have done in the case of this fellow. First, he was accused of his fault; then he
was convicted in the presence of one or two witnesses; thirdly, in the presence of the Church.
Thus we have made our solemn protest, and he has not listened to it. Henceforth let him
be excommunicated.</p>
<p>Further, let proclamation be made throughout the district, that he be excluded from
participation in any of the ordinary relations of life; so that by our withholding ourselves
from all intercourse with him he may become altogether food for the devil.3250</p>

<head>Letter CCLXXXIX.3251</head>
<head>Without address. Concerning an afflicted woman.</head>
<p>I consider it an equal mistake, to let the guilty go unpunished, and to exceed the proper
limits of punishment. I accordingly passed upon this man the sentence I considered it incumbent
on me to pass—excommunication from the Church. The sufferer I exhorted not
to avenge herself; but to leave to God the redressing of her wrongs. Thus if my admonitions
had possessed any weight, I should then have been obeyed, for the language I employed was
far more likely to ensure credit, than any letter to enforce compliance.</p>
<p>So, even after listening to her statements that contained matter sufficiently grave, I still
held my peace; and even now I am not sure that it becomes me to treat again of this same
question.</p>
<p>For, she says, I have foregone husband, children, all the enjoyments of life, for the attainment
of this single object, the favour of God, and good repute amongst men. Yet one day
the offender, an adept from boyhood in corrupting families, with the impudence habitual
to him, forced an entrance into my house; and thus within the bare limits of an interview
an acquaintanceship was formed. It was only owing to my ignorance of the man, and to
that timidity which comes from inexperience, that I hesitated openly to turn him out of
doors. Yet to such a pitch of impiety and insolence did he come, that he filled the whole
city with slanders, and publicly inveighed against me by affixing to the church doors libellous
placards. For this conduct, it is true, he incurred the displeasure of the law: but, nevertheless,
he returned to his slanderous attacks on me. Once more the market-place was filled with
his abuse, as well as the gymnasia, theatres, and houses whose congeniality of habits gained
him an admittance. Nor did his very extravagance lead men to recognise those virtues
wherein I was conspicuous, so universally had I been represented as being of an incontinent
disposition. In these calumnies, she goes on to say, some find a delight—such is the pleasure
men naturally feel in the disparagement of others; some profess to be pained, but shew no
sympathy; others believe the truth of these slanders; others again, having regard to the persistency
of his oaths, are undecided. But sympathy I have none. And now indeed I begin
to realise my loneliness, and bewail myself. I have no brother, friend, relation, no servant,
bond or free, in a word, no one whatever to share my grief. And yet, I think, I am more
than any one else an object of pity, in a city where the haters of wickedness are so few. They
bandy violence; but violence, though they fail to see it, moves in a circle, and in time will
overtake each one of them.</p>
<p>In such and still more appealing terms she told her tale, with countless tears, and so
departed. Nor did she altogether acquit me of blame; thinking that, when I ought to sym-
<note type="footnote">3251 Placed in the episcopate.</note>

<pb n="859"/>
pathise with her like a father, I am indifferent to her troubles, and regard the sufferings of
others too philosophically.</p>
<p>For it is not, she urged, the loss of money that you bid me disregard; nor the endurance
of bodily sufferings; but a damaged reputation, an injury involving loss upon the Church
at large.</p>
<p>This is her appeal; and now I pray you, most excellent sir, consider what answer you
would have me make her. The decision I have come to in my own mind is, not to surrender
offenders to the magistrates; yet not to rescue those already in their custody, since it has
long ago been declared by the Apostle, that the magistrates should be a terror to them in
their evil-doings; for, it is said, “he beareth not the sword in vain.”3252 To surrender him,
then, is contrary to my humanity; while to release him would be an encouragement to his
violence.</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, you will defer taking action until my arrival. I will then shew you
that I can effect nothing from there being none to obey me.</p>

<p>To Nectarius.</p>
<p>May many blessings rest on those who encourage your excellency in maintaining a
constant correspondence with me! And regard not such a wish as conventional merely, but
as expressing my sincere conviction of the value of your utterances. Whom could I honour
above Nectarius—known to me from his earliest days as a child of fairest promise, who now
through the exercise of every virtue has reached a position of the highest eminence?—So
much so, that of all my friends the dearest is the bearer of your letter.
Touching the election of those set over districts,3254 God forbid that I should do anything
for the gratification of man, through listening to importunities or yielding to fear. In that
case I should be not a steward, but a huckster, battering the gift of God for the favour of
man. But seeing that votes are given but by mortals, who can only bear such testimony as
they do from outward appearances, while the choice of fit persons is committed in all humility
to Him Who knows the secrets of the heart, haply it is best for everybody, when he
has tendered the evidence of his vote, to abstain from all heat and contention, as though
some self-interest were involved in the testimony, and to pray to God that what is advantageous
may not remain unknown. Thus the result is no longer attributable to man, but a
cause for thankfulness to God. For these things, if they be of man, cannot be said to be; but
are pretence only, altogether void of reality.</p>
<p>Consider also, that when a man strives with might and main to gain his end, there is no
small danger of his drawing even sinners to his side; and there is much sinfulness, such is
the weakness of man’s nature, even where we should least expect it.
Again, in private consultation we often offer our friends good advice, and, though we
do not find them taking it, yet we are not angry. Where then it is not man that counsels,
but God that determines, shall we feel indignation at not being preferred before the determination
of God?</p>
<p>And if these things were given to man by man, what need were there for us to ask them
of ourselves? Were it not better for each to take them from himself? But if they are the gift
of God, we ought to pray and not to grieve. And in our prayer we should not seek our own
will, but leave it to God who disposes for the best.</p>

<p>To Timotheus the Chorepiscopus.3256</p>
<p>The due limits of a letter, and that mode of addressing you, render it inconvenient for
me to write all I think; at the same time to pass over my thoughts in silence, when my heart
is burning with righteous indignation against you, is well-nigh impossible. I will adopt the
midway course: I will write some things; others I will omit. For I wish to chide you, if so I
may, in terms both flank and friendly.</p>
<p>Yes! that Timotheus whom I have known from boyhood, so intent upon an upright and
ascetic life, as even to be accused of excess therein, now forsakes the enquiry after those
means whereby we may be united to God; now makes it his first thought what some one
else may think of him, and lives a life of dependence upon the opinions of others; is mainly
anxious how to serve his friends, without incurring the ridicule of enemies; and fears disgrace
with the world as a great misfortune. Does he not know, that while he is occupied with
these trifles he is unconsciously neglecting his highest interests? For, that we cannot be
engaged with both at once—the things of this world and of Heaven—the holy Scriptures
are full of teaching for us. Nay, Nature herself is full of such instances. In the exercise of
the mental faculty, to think two thoughts at the same time is quite impossible. In the perceptions
of our senses, to admit two sounds falling upon our ears at the same moment, and
to distinguish them, although we are provided with two open passages, is impossible. Our
eyes, again, unless they are both fixed upon the object of our vision, are unable to perform
their action accurately.</p>
<p>Thus much for Nature; but to recite to you the evidence of the Scriptures were as ridiculous
as, so runs the proverb, ‘to carry owls to Athens.’3257 Why then combine things incompatible—
the tumults of civil life and the practice of religion?</p>
<p>Withdraw from clamour; be no more the cause or object of annoyance; let us keep
ourselves to ourselves. We long since proposed religion as our aim; let us make the attainment
of it our practice, and shew those who have the wish to insult us that it does not lie
with them to annoy us at their will. But this will only be when we have clearly shewn them
that we afford no handle for abuse.</p>
<p>For the present enough of this! Would that some day we might meet and more perfectly
consider those things that be for our souls’ welfare; so may we not be too much occupied
with thoughts of vanity, since death must one day overtake us.</p>

<p>How fare you this long while? Have you altogether recovered the use of your hand?
And how do other things prosper? According to your wishes and my prayers? In accordance

<p>Where men are readily disposed to change, it is only natural that their lives are not well
ordered: but where their minds are fixed, steadfast and unalterable, it follows that their lives
should be conformable to their purposes.</p>
<p>True, it is not in the helmsman’s power to make a calm when he wishes; but with us, it
is quite easy to render our lives tranquil by stilling the storms of passion that surge within,
by rising superior to those that assail us from without. The upright man is touched by
neither loss, nor sickness, nor the other ills of life; for he walks in heart with God, keeps his
gaze fixed upon the future, and easily and lightly weathers the storms that rise from earth.</p>

goodness shews signs of promise for them.</p>
<p>The husbandman finds toil a pleasure when he sees the ears ripen or the plants increase;
the teacher is gladdened at his pupils’ growth in knowledge, the father at his son’s in stature.
But greater is the care I feel for you; higher the hopes I entertain; in proportion as piety is
more excellent than all the arts, than all the animals and fruits together.</p>
<p>And piety I planted in your heart while still pure and tender, and I matured it in the

teach things profitable, their eagerness is well nigh uncontrollable; but first their hearers’
minds must be cleared of all resistance.</p>
<p>Not that separation in the body is a hindrance to instruction. The Creator, in the fulness
of His love and wisdom, did not confine our minds within our bodies, nor the power of
speaking to our tongues. Ability to profit derives some advantage even from lapse of time;
thus we are able to transmit instruction, not only to those who are dwelling far away, but

lived many years before teach posterity by instruction preserved in their writings; and we,

you all united in one body, and to hear that you are not content to live a life without witness;
but have undertake</p>
<p>Thus will each of you receive a reward in full, not only on his own behalf, but also for
his brother’s progress. And, as is fitting, you will be a source of mutual profit, both by your
words and deeds, as a result of constant intercourse and exhortation. But above all I exhort
you to be mindful of the faith of the Fathers, and not to be shaken by those who in your retirement
would try to wrest you from it. For you know that unless illumined by faith in
God, strictness of life availeth nothing; nor will a right confession of faith, if void of good
works, be able to present you before the Lord.</p>
<p>Faith and works must be joined: so shall the man of God be perfect, and his life not
halt through any imperfection.</p>
<p>For the faith which saves us, as saith the Apostle, is that which worketh by love.</p>

<p>To a Censitor.3259</p>
<p>I was aware, before you told me, that you do not like your employment in public affairs.
It is an old saying that those who are anxious to lead a pious life do not throw themselves
with pleasure into office. The case of magistrates seems to me like that of physicians. They
see awful sights; they meet with bad smells; they get trouble for themselves out of other
people’s calamities. This is at least the case with those who are real magistrates. All men
who are engaged in business, look also to make a profit, and are excited about this kind of
glory, count it the greatest possible advantage to acquire some power and influence by which
they may be able to benefit their friends, punish their enemies, and get what they want for
themselves. You are not a man of this kind. How should you be? You have voluntarily
withdrawn from even high office in the State. You might have ruled the city like one single
house, but you have preferred a life free from care and anxiety. You have placed a higher
value on having no troubles yourself and not troubling other people, than other people do
on making themselves disagreeable. But it has seemed good to the Lord that the district of
Ibora3260 should not be under the power of hucksters, nor be turned into a mere slave
market. It is His will that every individual in it should be enrolled, as is right. Do you
therefore accept this responsibility? It is vexatious, I know, but it is one which may bring
you the approbation of God. Neither fawn upon the great and powerful, nor despise the
poor and needy. Show to all under your rule an impartiality of mind, balanced more exactly
than any scales. Thus in the sight of those who have entrusted you with these responsibilities
your zeal for justice will be made evident, and they will view you with exceptional admiration.
And even though you go unnoticed by them, you will not be unnoticed by our God. The
prizes which He has put before us for good works are great.</p>

the opportunity of shewing your magnanimity, you are eager for my letters, because you

for your shewing all the signs of rectitude, and at the same time for the public exhibition of
your virtues! Certain persons have come from Alexandria for the discharge of a necessary
duty which is due from all men to the dead. They ask your excellency to give orders that it
may be permitted them to have conveyed away, under official sanction, the corpse of a relative
who departed this life at Sebasteia, while the troops were quartered there. They further
beg that, as far as possible, aid may be given them for travelling at the public expense, so
that, of your bounty, they may find some help and solace in their long journey. The tidings
of this will travel as far as to great Alexandria, and will convey thither the report of your
excellency’s astonishing kindness. This you well understand without my mentioning it. I
shall add gratitude for this one more favour to that which I feel for all which you have done

<p>Write straight, and make the lines straight. Do not let your hand go too high or too
low. Avoid forcing the pen to travel slantwise, like Æsop’s crab. Advance straight on, as if
following the line of the carpenter’s rule, which always preserves exactitude and prevents
any irregularity. The oblique is ungraceful. It is the straight which pleases the eye, and does
not allow the reader’s eyes to go nodding up and down like a swing-beam. This has been
my fate in reading your writing. As the lines lie ladderwise, I was obliged, when I had to go
from one to another, to mount up to the end of the last: then, when no connexion was to
be found, I had to go back, and seek for the right order again, retreating and following the
furrow,3265 like Theseus in the story following Ariadne’s thread.3266 Write straight, and

<p>I am really ashamed of sending you the Cappadocians one by one. I should prefer to
induce all our youths to devote themselves to letters and learning, and to avail themselves
of your instruction in their training. But it is impracticable to get hold of them all at once,
while they choose what suits themselves. I therefore send you those who from time to time
are won over; and this I do with the assurance that I am conferring on them a boon as great
as that which is given by those who bring thirsty men to the fountain. The lad, whom I am
now sending, will be highly valued for his own sake when he has been in your society. He
is already well known on account of his father, who has won a name among us both for
rectitude of life and for authority in our community. He is, moreover, a close friend of my
own. To requite him for his friendship to me, I am conferring on his son the benefit of an
introduction to you—a boon well worthy of being earnestly prayed for by all who are competent
to judge of a man’s high character.</p>

deomnium illarum epist. mutuarum νοθείU+0026 139· quædam opponit.” Fabricius. Harles., Tom. ix. Maran (Vit.
Bas. xxxix. 2) thinks that the Libanian correspondence, assuming it to be genuine, is to be assigned partly to the
period of the retreat, partly to that of the presbyterate, while two only, the one a complaint on the part of
Libanius that bishops are avaricious, and Basil’s retort, may perhaps have been written during the episcopate.
He would see no reason for rejecting them on the ground merely of the unlikelihood of Basil’s corresponding
with a heathen philosopher, but he is of opinion that the style of most of them is unworthy both of the sophist
and of the archbishop. Yet there seems no reason why they should have been invented. It is intelligible enough
that they should have been preserved, considering the reputation of the writers; but they suggest no motive for
forgery. The life of Libanius extended from 314 to nearly the end of the fourth century. J. R. Mozley, in D.C.B.
(iv. 712) refers to G. R. Siever (Das Leben des Libanius, Berlin, 1868) as the fullest biographer.</note>

<head>Letter CCCXXXVI.</head>
<p>Libanius to Basilius.</p>
<p>1. After some little time a young Cappadocian has reached me. One gain to me is that
he is a Cappadocian. But this Cappadocian is one of the first rank. This is another gain.
Further, he brings me a letter from the admirable Basil. This is the greatest gain of all. You
think that I have forgotten you. I had great respect for you in your youth. I saw you vying
with old men in self-restraint, and this in a city teeming with pleasures. I saw you already
in possession of considerable learning. Then you thought that you ought also to see Athens,
and you persuaded Celsus to accompany you. Happy Celsus, to be dear to you! Then you
returned, and lived at home, and I said to myself, What, I wonder, is Basil about now? To
what occupation has he betaken himself? Is he following the ancient orators, and practising
in the courts? Or is he turning the sons of fortunate fathers into orators? Then there came
those who reported to me that you were adopting a course of life better than any of these,
and were, rather, bethinking you how you might win the friendship of God than heaps of
gold, I blessed both you and the Cappadocians; you, for making this your aim; them, for
being able to point to so noble a fellow-countryman.</p>
<p>2. I am aware that the Firmus, whom you mention, has continually won everywhere;3268
hence his great power as a speaker. But with all the eulogies that have been bestowed on
him, I am not aware that he has ever received such praise as I have heard of in your letter.
For what a credit it is to him, that it should be you who declare that his reputation is inferior
to none!</p>
<p>Apparently, you have despatched this young man to me before seeing Firminus; had
you done so, your letters would not have failed to mention him. What is Firminus now
doing or intending to do? Is he still anxious to be married? Or is all that over now? Are
the claims of the senate heavy on him? Is he obliged to stay where he is? Is there any hope
of his taking to study again ? Let him send me an answer, and I trust it may be satisfactory.
If it be a distressing one, at least it will relieve him from seeing me at his door. And if
Firminus had been now at Athens, what would your senators have done? Would they have
sent the Salaminia3269 after him? You see that it is only by your fellow-countrymen that I
am wronged. Yet I shall never cease to love and praise the Cappadocians. I should like
them to be better disposed to me, but, if they continue to act as they do, I shall bear it.

Firminus was four months with me, and was not a day idle. You will know how much he
has acquired, and perhaps will not complain. As to his being able to come here again, what
ally can I call in? If your senators are right-minded, as men of education ought to be, they
will honour me in the second case, since they grieved me in the first.</p>

<p>Lo and behold, yet another Cappadocian has come to you; a son of my own! Yet my

of the former one, and worthy of the same attention alike from me his father, and from you
his instructor—if really it is possible for these young men, who come from me, to obtain
any further favours. I do not mean that it is not possible for your excellency to give anything
more to your old comrades, but because your services are so lavishly bestowed upon all. It
will be sufficient for the lad before he gets experience if he be numbered among those who
are intimately known to you. I trust you may send him back to me worthy of my prayers
and of your great reputation in learning and eloquence. He is accompanied by a young man
of his own age, and of like zeal for instruction; a youth of good family, and closely associated
with myself. I am sure he will be in every way as well treated, though his means are smaller

<p>Libanius to Basil.</p>
<p>I know you will often write, “Here is another Cappadocian for you!” I expect that you
will send me many. I am sure that you are everywhere putting pressure on both fathers and
sons by all your complimentary expressions about me. But it would not be kind on my part
not to mention what happened about your good letter. There were sitting with me not a
few of our people of distinction, and among them the very excellent Alypius, Hierocles’
cousin. The messengers gave in the letter. I read it right through without a word; then with
a smile, and evidently gratified, I exclaimed, “I am vanquished!” “How? When? Where?”
they asked. “How is it that you are not distressed at being vanquished?” “I am beaten,” I
replied, “in beautiful letter writing. Basil has won. But I love him; and so I am delighted.”
On hearing this, they all wanted to hear of the victory from the letter itself. It was read by
Alypius, while all listened. It was voted that what I had said was quite true. Then the reader
went out, with the letter still in his hand, to shew it, I suppose, to others. I had some difficulty
in getting it back. Go on writing others like it; go on winning. This is for me to win. You
are quite right in thinking that my services are not measured by money. Enough for him
who has nothing to give, that he is as wishful to receive. If I perceive any one who is poor
to be a lover of learning, he takes precedence of the rich. True, I never found such instructors;
but nothing shall stand in the way of my being, at least in that respect, an improvement on
mine. Let no one, then, hesitate to come hither because he is poor, if only he possesses the
one qualification of knowing how to work.</p>

<p>What could not a sophist say? And such a sophist! One whose peculiar art is,
whenever he likes, to make great things small, and to give greatness to small things! This
is what you have shewn in my case. That dirty little letter of mine, as, perhaps, you who live
in all luxury of eloquence would call it, a letter in no way more tolerable than the one you
hold in your hands now, you have so extolled as, forsooth, to be eaten by it, and to be
yielding me the prize for composition! You are acting much as fathers do, when they join
in their boys’ games, and let the little fellows be proud of the victories which they have let
them win without any loss to themselves, and with much gain to the children’s emulation.
Really and truly the delight your speech must have given, when you were joking about me,
must have been indescribable! It is as though some Polydamas3270 or Milo3271 were to decline
the pancratium or a wrestling bout with me!3272 After carefully examining, I have
found no sign of weakness. So those who look for exaggeration are the more astonished at
your being able to descend in sport to my level, than if you had led the barbarian in full sail
over Athos.3273 I, however, my dear sir, am now spending my time with Moses and Elias,
and saints like them, who tell me their stories in a barbarous tongue,3274 and I utter what I
learnt from them, true, indeed, in sense, though rude in phrase, as what I am writing testifies.
If ever I learned anything from you, I have forgotten it in the course of time. But do you
continue to write to me, and so suggest other topics for correspondence. Your letter will
exhibit you, and will not convict me. I have already introduced to you the son of Anysius,
as a son of my own. If he is my son, he is the child of his father, poor, and a poor man’s
son. What I am saying is well known to one who is wise as well as a sophist.3275</p>

have written now. You call me a sophist, and you allege that it is a sophist’s business to
make small things great and great things small. And you maintain that the object of my
letter was to prove yours a good one, when it was not a good one, and that it was no better
than the one which you have sent last, and, in a word that you have no power of expression,
the books which you have now in hand producing no such effect, and the eloquence which
you once possessed having all disappeared. Now, in the endeavour to prove this, you have
made this epistle too, which you are reviling, so admirable, that my visitors could not refrain
from leaping with admiration as it was being read. I was astonished that after your trying
to run down the former one by this, by saying that the former one was like it, you have really
complimented the former by it. To carry out your object, you ought to have made this one
worse, that you might slander the former. But it is not like you, I think, to do despite to the
truth. It would have been done despite to, if you had purposely written badly, and not put
out the powers you have. It would be characteristic of you not to find fault with what is
worthy of praise, lest in your attempt to make great things insignificant, your proceedings
reduce you to the rank of the sophists. Keep to the books which you say are inferior in style,
though better in sense. No one hinders you. But of the principles which are ever mine, and
once were yours, the roots both remain and will remain, as long as you exist. Though you
water them ever so little, no length of time will ever completely destroy them.</p>

<p>You have not yet ceased to be offended with me, and so I tremble as I write. If you have
cared, why, my dear sir, do you not write? If you are still offended, a thing alien from any
reasonable soul and from your own, why, while you are preaching to others, that they must
not keep their anger till sundown,3276 have you kept yours during many suns? Peradventure
you have meant to punish me by depriving me of the sound of your sweet voice? Nay; excellent

<p>All who are attached to the rose, as might be expected in the case of lovers of the beautiful,
are not displeased even at the thorns from out of which the flower blows. I have even
heard it said about roses by some one, perhaps in jest, or, it may be, even in earnest, that
nature has furnished the bloom with those delicate thorns, like stings of love to lovers, to
excite those who pluck them to intenser longing by these ingeniously adapted pricks.3277
But what do I mean by this introduction of the rose into my letter? You do not need telling,
when you remember your own letter. It had indeed the bloom of the rose, and, by its fair
speech, opened out all spring to me; but it was bethorned with certain fault findings and
charges against me. But even the thorn of your words is delightful to me, for it enkindles
in me a greater longing for your friendship.</p>

<p>Libanius to Basil.</p>
<p>It is, I think, more needful for me to defend myself for not having begun to write to you
long ago, than to offer any excuse for beginning now. I am that same man who always used
to run up whenever you put in an appearance, and who listened with the greatest delight to
the stream of your eloquence; rejoicing to hear you; with difficulty tearing myself away;
saying to my friends, This man is thus far superior to the daughters of Achelous, in that,
like them, he soothes, but he does not hurt as they do. Truly it is no great thing not to hurt;
but this man’s songs are a positive gain to the hearer. That I should be in this state of mind,
should think that I am regarded with affection, and should seem able to speak, and yet
should not venture to write, is the mark of a man guilty of extreme idleness, and, at the same
time, inflicting punishment on himself. For it is clear that you will requite my poor little
letter with a fine large one, and will take care not to wrong me again. At this word, I fancy,
many will cry out, and will crowd round with the shout, What! has Basil done any
wrong—even a small wrong? Then so have OEacus, and Minos and his brother.3278 In
other points I admit that you have won. Who ever saw you that does not envy you? But in
one thing you have sinned against me; and, if I remind you of it, induce those who are indignant
thereat not to make a public outcry. No one has ever come to you and asked a favour
which it was easy to give, and gone away unsuccessful. But I am one of those who have
craved a boon without receiving it. What then did I ask? Often when I was with you in
camp, I was desirous of entering, with the aid of your wisdom, into the depth of Homer’s
frenzy. If the whole is impossible, I said, do you bring me to a portion of what I want. I
was anxious for a part, wherein, when things have gone ill with the Greeks, Agamemnon
courts with gifts the man whom he has insulted. When I so spoke, you laughed, because
you could not deny that you could if you liked, but were unwilling to give. Do I really seem
to be wronged to you and to your friends, who were indignant at my saying that you were
doing a wrong?</p>

<head>Letter CCCLXVI.3294</head>
<p>Basil to Urbicius the monk, concerning continency.</p>
<p>You do well in making exact definitions for us, so that we may recognise not only continency,
but its fruit. Now its fruit is the companionship of God. For not to be corrupted,
is to have part with God; just as to be corrupted is the companionship of the world. Continency
is denial of the body, and confession to God. It withdraws from anything mortal, like
a body which has the Spirit of God. It is without rivalry and envy, and causes us to be united
to God. He who loves a body envies another. He who has not admitted the disease of corruption
into his heart, is for the future strong enough to endure any labour, and though he
have died in the body, he lives in incorruption. Verily, if I rightly apprehend the matter,
God seems to me to be continency, because He desires nothing, but has all things in Himself.
He reaches after nothing, nor has any sense in eyes or ears; wanting nothing, He is in all
respects complete and full. Concupiscence is a disease of the soul; but continency is its
health. And continency must not be regarded only in one species, as, for instance, in matters
of sensual love. It must be regarded in everything which the soul lusts after in an evil manner,
not being content with what is needful for it. Envy is caused for the sake of gold, and innumerable
wrongs for the sake of other lusts. Not to be drunken is continency. Not to overeat
one’s self is continency. To subdue the body is continency, and to keep evil thoughts in
subjection, whenever the soul is disturbed by any fancy false and bad, and the heart is distracted
by vain cares. Continency makes men free, being at once a medicine and a power,
for it does not teach temperance; it gives it. Continency is a grace of God. Jesus seemed to
be continency, when He was made light to land and sea; for He was carried neither by earth
nor ocean, and just as He walked on the sea, so He did not weigh down the earth. For if
death comes of corruption, and not dying comes of not having corruption, then Jesus
wrought not mortality but divinity.3295 He ate and drank in a peculiar manner, without
rendering his food.3296 So mighty a power in Him was continency, that His food was not

corrupted in Him, since He had no corruption. If only there be a little continency in us, we
are higher than all. We have been told that angels were ejected from heaven because of
concupiscence and became incontinent. They were vanquished; they did not come down.
What could that plague have effected there, if an eye such as I am thinking of had been
there? Wherefore I said, If we have a little patience, and do not love the world, but the life
above, we shall be found there where we direct our mind. For it is the mind, apparently,
which is the eye that seeth unseen things. For we say “the mind sees;” “the mind hears.” I

<p>“O Dieu quelle a été l’ignorance des sages du monde, qu’on a appelés philosophes d’avoir
cru que vous, parfait architecte et absolu formateur de tout ce qui est, vous aviez trouvé sous
vos mains une matière qui vous ótait co-éternelle, informe néamoins, et qui attendait de
vous sa perfection! Aveugles, qui n’entendaient pas que d’être capable de forme, c’est deja
quelque forme; c’est quelque perfection, que d’être capable de perfection; et si la matière
avail d’elle-même ce commencement de perfection et de forme, elle en pouvait aussitôt avoir
d’ellemême l’entier accomplissement.: 267</p>
<p>Ainsi il a fait la lumière avant que de faire les grands luminaires où il a voulu la ramasser:
et il a fait la distinction des jours avant que d’avoir créé les astres dont il s’est servi pour les
régler parfaitement: et le soir et le matin ont été distingués, avant que leur distinction et la
division parfaite du jour et de la nuit fût bien marquée; et les arbres, et les arbustes, et les
herbes ont germé sur la terre par ordre de Dieu, avant qu’il eût fait le soleil, qui devait être
le père de toutes ces plantes; et il a détaché exprès les effets d’avec leurs causes naturelles,
pour montrer que naturellement tout ne tient qu’à lui seul, et ne dépend que de sa seule
volonté: 309</p>
<p>Aveugles, conducteurs d’aveugles, qui tombez dans le prêcipice, et y jetez ceux qui vous
suivent (St. Matthieu xv. 14), dites-mois qui a assujeti à Dieu ce qu’il n’a pas fait, ce qui est
de soi aussi bien que Dieu, ce qui est indépendamment de Dieu même? Par où a-t-il trouvé
prise sur ce qui lui est étranger et independant et sa puissance; et par quel art ou quel pouvoir
se l’est-il soumis?…Mais qu’est-ce après tout que cette matière si parfait, qu’elle ait ellemême
ce fond de son être; et si imparfaite, qu’elle attende sa perfection d’un autre? Dieu
aura fait l’accident et n’aura pas fait la substance? (Bossuet, Elévations sur les mystères, 3e

puissance de Dieu; mais au fond que c’est image est dèfectueuse! Dieu n’a point de lèvres

<p>Malgré l’authorité de dom Maran, nous croyons avec Tillemont, Dupont et M. Albert de

Basile mais à St. Basile lui-même.” Étude historique et littéraire sur St. Basile.: 434
On doit d’autant plus louer le grand sens de Saint Basile qui s’inspire presqu’ entièrement
d’Origène et de Plotin, sans tomber dans leur erreur. En riant toute espèce de relation entre
les astres et les actes de l’homme, il conserve intacte notre liberté: 313</p>

<p>Qui a donné aux oiseaux et aux poissons ces rames naturelles, qui leur font fendre les eaux
et les airs? Ce qui peut être a donné lieu à leur Créateur de les produire ensemble, comme
animaux d’un dessin à peu près semblable: le vol des oiseaux semblant, etre une espèce de
faculté de nager dans une liqueur plus subtile, comme la faculté de nager dans les poissons
est une espèce de vol dans une liqueur plus épaisse: 334</p>
<p>Regii: 133</p>
<p>Si Basile ne va pas, comme la majorité du Concile de Constantinople, jusqu’à traiter l’Occident
comne étranger; s’il ne pretend pas que 1’empire appartienne à l’Orient, parce que
l’Orient voit naitre le Soleil, et que c’est en Orient que Dieu brilla dans une enveloppe
charnelle,: 130</p>

<head>NPNF2-05. Gregory of Nyssa: Dogmatic Treatises, Etc. by Philip
Schaff</head>
<p>With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a momentous achievement.
Originally gathered by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a collection of
writings by classical and medieval Christian theologians. The purpose of such a collection
is to make their writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two series, each
with fourteen volumes. The second series focuses on a variety of important Church Fathers,
ranging from the fourth century to the eighth century. This volume contains selected
treatises of St. Gregory of Nyssa. A fourth century bishop, St. Gregory wrote on theology,
philosophy, ethics, oration, and asceticism. The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers are comprehensive
in scope, and provide keen translations of instructive and illuminating texts from
some of the great theologians of the Christian church. These spiritually enlightening texts
have aided Christians for over a thousand years, and remain instructive and fruitful even
today!

<head>NPNF1-09. St. Chrysostom: On the Priesthood; Ascetic Treatises;
Select Homilies and Letters; Homilies on the Statutes by Philip Schaff</head>
<p>With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a momentous achievement.
Originally gathered by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a collection of
writings by classical and medieval Christian theologians. The purpose of such a collection
is to make their writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two series. The
first series focuses on two classical Christian theologians--St. Augustine and St. John
Chrysostom. St. Augustine is one of the most influential and important Christian thinkers
of all time. In addition to reprinting his most popular two works--the Confessions and the
City of God--these volumes also contain other noteworthy and important works of St. Augustine,
such as On the Holy Trinity, Christian Doctrine, and others. St. John Chrysostom
was an eloquent speaker and well-loved Christian clergyman. St. John took a more literal
interpretation of Scripture, and much of his work focused on practical aspects of Christianity,
particularly what is now called social justice. He advocated for the poor, and challenged
abuses of authority. The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is comprehensive in scope, and
provide keen translations of instructive and illuminating texts from some of the greatest

<head>NPNF1-09. St. Chrysostom: On the Priesthood;
Ascetic Treatises; Select Homilies and Letters;
Homilies on the Statutes</head>

<pb n="ii"/>
<p>Author(s): Schaff, Philip (1819-1893) (Editor)</p>
<p>Publisher: Grand Rapids, MI: Christian Classics Ethereal Library</p>
<p>Description: With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene
Fathers is a momentous achievement. Originally gathered
by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a
collection of writings by classical and medieval Christian
theologians.The purpose of such a collection is to make their
writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two
series. The first series focuses on two classical Christian
theologians--St. Augustine and St. John Chrysostom. St.
Augustine is one of the most influential and important Christian
thinkers of all time. In addition to reprinting his most
popular two works--the Confessions and the City of
God--these volumes also contain other noteworthy and important
works of St. Augustine, such as On the Holy Trinity,
Christian Doctrine, and others. St. John Chrysostom was an
eloquent speaker and well-loved Christian clergyman. St.
John took a more literal interpretation of Scripture, and much
of his work focused on practical aspects of Christianity, particularly
what is now called social justice. He advocated for
the poor, and challenged abuses of authority. The Nicene
and Post-Nicene Fathers is comprehensive in scope, and
provide keen translations of instructive and illuminating texts
from some of the greatest theologians of the Christian church.
These spiritually enlightening texts have aided Christians for
over a thousand years, and remain instructive and fruitful
even today!

<head>PREFACE.</head>
<p>With this volume, we begin the Works of St. Chrysostom. It contains a sketch of his life
and labors, the book on the priesthood, the letters to Theodore, the catechetical instructions,
and a selection of ascetic treatises, special homilies, letters to Olympias and Innocent, and
the twenty-one Homilies on the Statues.</p>
<p>The translations are entirely new, or thoroughly revised, by the Rev. W. R. W. Stephens,
whose services I was so fortunate as to secure. He has written the best biography of St.
Chrysostom and is thoroughly at home in his writings. He has taken great pains, with the
aid of two friends, the Rev. T. P. Brandram and Rev. R. Blackburn, and is responsible for
the whole volume, with the exception of the Prolegomena, which I wrote myself, to correspond
with the Prolegomena to the works of St. Augustin.</p>
<p>The other volumes of St. Chrysostom in this series will be devoted to his exegetical
Homilies on the greater part of the New Testament.</p>

<head>CHAPTER I.—Literature.</head>
<p>i. editions of chrysostom’s works.</p>
<p>S. Joannis Chrysostomi, archiepiscopi Constantinopolitani, Opera omnia quæ exstant
vel quæ ejus nomine circumferuntur, ad mss. codices Gallicos, Vaticanos, Anglicos, Germanicosque
castigata, etc. Opera et studio D.Bernardi de Montfaucon, monachi ordinis S. Benedicti
e congregatione S. Mauri, opem ferentibus aliis ex codem sodalitio, monachis. Greek and
Latin, Paris, 1718–’38, in 13 vols., fol. This is the best edition, and the result of about twenty
years of the patient labor of Montfaucon (d. Dec. 21, 1741, 86 years old), and several assistants
of the brotherhood of St. Maur. More than three hundred mss. were made use of, but the
eight principal mss., as Field has shown, were not very carefully collated. Montfaucon, who
at the date of the completion of his edition was 83 years old, prepared valuable prefaces to
every treatise and set of homilies, arranged the works in chronological order, and added in
vol. XIII. learned dissertations on the life, doctrine, discipline and heresies of the age of
Chrysostom.</p>
<p>The Benedictine edition was reprinted at Venice, 1734–’41, in 13 vols. fol.; at Paris, ed.
by F. de Sinner (Gaume), 1834–’39, in 13 vols. (an elegant edition, with some additions);
and, with various improvements and corrections, by J. P. Migne, Petit-Montrouge, 1859–’63,
in 13 vols. The last is the most complete edition, but inferior in paper and type to that of
Gaume. Migne uses the critical text of Field in Matthew and the Pauline Epp. He had previously
edited a Latin Version, 1842, in 9 vols.</p>
<p>The edition of Sir Henry Savile (Provost of Eton), Etonæ, 1612, in 8 vols. fol., is less
complete than the Benedictine edition, but gives a more correct Greek text (as was shown
by F. Dübner from a collation of manuscripts) and valuable notes. Savile personally examined
the libraries of Europe and spent £8,000 on his edition. His wife was so jealous of his devotion
to Chrysostom that she threatened to burn his manuscripts.</p>
<p>The edition of Fronton le Duc, a French Jesuit, and the two brothers, Frederick and
Claude Morel, was published at Paris, 1636, in 12 vols. fol., Greek and Latin.</p>

<pb n="4"/>
<p>A selection of Chrysostom’s works (Opera præstantissima) in Greek and Latin, was edited
by T. G. Lomler, Rudolphopoli (Rudolstadt), 1840 (unfinished).</p>
<p>The best edition of the Greek text of the Homilies on Matthew, and all the Pauline Epistles
is by Dr. Frederick Field, of the Church of England (d. 1883), in the “Bibliotheca Patrum
Ecclesiæ Orientalis qui ante Orientis et Occidentis schisma floruerunt.” The Homilies on
Matthew appeared at Cambridge, 1839, 3 vols.; the Homilies on the Epistles of Paul and the
Hebrews, Oxford, 1839–’62, in 7 vols.</p>
<p>The treatise De Sacerdotio (περί ἱερωσύνης) was separately edited by Erasmus in Greek
(Basel, 1525, from the press of Frobenius), by J. Hughes, in Greek and Latin (Cambridge,
1710), and by J. A. Bengel, the commentator, in Greek (Stuttgart, 1725, and repeatedly reprinted
since at Leipzig, 1825, 1834, 1872, by C. Tauchnitz). Lomler (Chrys. Opera, pp. viii.
and ix.) enumerates twenty-three separate editions and translations of the treatise on the
Priesthood.</p>
<p>ii. translations.—(a) german translations.</p>
<p>The treatise on the Priesthood has been translated by Hasselbach, 1820; Ritter, 1821,
and others. The Bibliothek der Kirchenväter (Rom. Cath.), published at Kempten in Bavaria,
devotes ten small volumes to St. Chrysostom, including the Priesthood, ascetic Treatises,
and Homilies, translated by Joh. Chrysostomus Mitterrutzner, 1869–’84. German translations
of selected Homilies by J. A. Cramer (Leipzig, 1748–’51, 10 vols.); Feder (Augsburg, 1786);
Ph. Mayer (Nürnberg, 1830); W. Arnoldi (Trier, 1835); Augusti (Predigten der Kirchenväter,
vols. I. and II., Leipzig, 1839); Jos. Lutz (Tübingen, 2d ed. 1859); Gust. Leonhardi (Leipzig,
1888, selected sermons and orations, in vol I. of Klassikerbibliothek der Christl. Predigtliteratur).</p>
<p>(b) english translations.</p>
<p>The work on the Priesthood was translated by Hollier (London, 1728); Bunce (London,
1759); Hohler (Cambridge, 1837); Marsh (London, 1844); Harris Cowper (London, 1866);
and Stephens (N. York, 1888, prepared for this “Library”).</p>
<p>The Homilies on the Statues and on the New Testament were translated by several
scholars for the “Oxford Library of the Fathers,” 1839–’77, 16 vols. The earlier parts (on the
First Epistle to the Corinthians, and on the Statues) are based on the text of Montfaucon
and Savile, the later parts on the improved text of Field. The Oxford translation has been
revised and annotated by American scholars for this “Library,” and new translations of
other works of St. Chrysostom have been added, namely, the treatise on the Priesthood, the
Exhortation to the fallen Theodore, Letters, Tracts, and Special Homilies (in this first volume).</p>

<head>CHAPTER II.—Chrysostom’s Youth and Training, a.d. 347–370.</head>
<p>“Almighty God, who hast given us grace at this time with one accord to make our
common supplications unto Thee; and doest promise, that when two or three are gathered
together in Thy name Thou wilt grant their requests: fulfil now, O Lord, the desires and
petitions of Thy servants, as may be most expedient for them; granting us in this world
knowledge of Thy truth, and in the world to come life everlasting, Amen.”1</p>
<p>This beautiful and comprehensive prayer, which is translated from the Liturgy of St.
Chrysostom, has made his name a household word wherever the Anglican Liturgy is known
and used.</p>
<p>John, surnamed Chrysostom ('Ιω€ννης Χρυσόστομος) is the greatest pulpit orator and
commentator of the Greek Church, and still deservedly enjoys the highest honor in the
whole Christian world. No one of the Oriental Fathers has left a more spotless reputation;
no one is so much read and so often quoted by modern preachers and commentators. An
admiring posterity, since the close of the fifth century, has given him the surname Chrysostom
(the Golden Mouth), which has entirely superseded his personal name John, and which best
expresses the general estimate of his merits.</p>
<p>His life may be divided into five periods: (1) His youth and training till his conversion
and baptism, A.D. 347–370. (2) His ascetic and monastic life, 370–381. (3) His public life
as priest and preacher at Antioch, 381–398. (4) His episcopate at Constantinople, 398–404.
(5) His exile to his death, 404–407.</p>
<p>John (the name by which alone he is known among contemporary writers and his first
biographers) was born in 347,2 at Antioch, the capital of Syria, and the home of the mother
church of Gentile Christianity, where the disciples of Jesus were first called “Christians.”</p>
<note type="footnote">1 See the Greek original of this collect in Chrysostom’s Liturgy, in Migne’s edition, Tom. xii. 908; Daniel’s
Codex Liturgicus, tom. iv.; Fasc. II. p. 343 (comp. the foot-note in tom. iii. 358); and Fr. Procter’s History of the
Book of Common Prayer (11th ed. 1874), p. 245 sq. The precise origin of this prayer is uncertain. It does not
occur in the oldest mss. of Chrysostom’s Liturgy, but in those of the Liturgy of St. Basil. It precedes the third
anthem in the communion service, and was used since the ninth century or earlier in the exarchate of Cæsarea
and the patriarchate of Constantinople. In the Oriental churches the prayer is said silently by the priest. See
Bjerring, The Offices of the Oriental Church, p. 43. In the Anglican Church, it was placed at the end of the Litany
(by Cranmer), in 1544, and at the close of the daily Morning and Evening Prayer in 1661. In the English Homilies
(Hom. I.), Chrysostom is called “that godly clerk and great preacher.”</note>

<p>His father, Secundus, was a distinguished military officer (magister militum) in the imperial
army of Syria, and died during the infancy of John, without professing Christianity,
as far as we know. His mother, Anthusa, was a rare woman. Left a widow at the age of twenty,
she refused all offers of marriage, and devoted herself exclusively to the education of her
only son and his older sister. She was probably from principle averse to a second marriage,
according to a prevailing view of the Fathers. She shines, with Nonna and Monica, among
the most pious mothers of the fourth century, who prove the ennobling influence of Christianity
on the character of woman, and through her on all the family relations. Anthusa
gained general esteem by her exemplary life. The famous advocate of heathenism, Libanius,
on hearing of her consistency and devotion, felt constrained to exclaim: “Bless me! what
wonderful women there are among the Christians.”3</p>
<p>She gave her son an admirable education, and early planted in his soul the germs of
piety, which afterwards bore the richest fruits for himself and the church. By her admonitions
and the teachings of the Bible, he was secured against the seductions of heathenism.</p>
<p>Yet he was not baptized till he had reached the age of maturity. In that age of transition
from heathenism to Christianity, the number of adult baptisms far exceeded that of infant
baptisms. Hence the large baptisteries for the baptism of crowds of converts; hence the many
sermons and lectures of Chrysostom, Cyril of Jerusalem and other preachers to catechumens,
and their careful instruction before baptism and admission to the Missa Fidelium or the
holy communion. Even Christian parents, as the father and mother of Gregory Nazianzen,
the mother of Chrysostom, and the mother of Augustin, put off the baptism of their offspring,
partly no doubt from a very high conception of baptism as the sacrament of regeneration,
and the superstitious fear that early baptism involved the risk of a forfeiture of baptismal
grace. This was the argument which Tertullian in the second century urged against infant
baptism, and this was the reason why many professing Christians put off their baptism till
the latest hour; just as now so many from the same motive delay repentance and conversion
to their death-bed. Chrysostom often rebukes that custom. The Emperor Constantine who
favored Christianity as early as 312, and convened the Council of Nicæa in 325, postponed
baptism till 337, shortly before his death. The orthodox Emperor Theodosius the Great was
not baptized till the first year of his reign (380), when attacked by a serious illness.</p>
<p>Chrysostom received his literary training chiefly from Libanius, the admirer and friend
of Julian the Apostate, and the first classical scholar and rhetorician of his age, who after a
<note type="footnote">3 Βαβαὶ, οἷαι παρὰ χριστιανοῖς γυναῖκ™ς εἰσι. Chrysostom himself relates this of his heathen teacher (by whom,
undoubtedly, we are to understand Libanius), though, it is true, with immediate reference only to the twenty
years’ widowhood of his mother, and adds: “Such is the praise and admiration of widowhood not only with us,
but even with the heathen.” Ad viduam juniorem (Opera, Bened. ed. Tom. i. 340; in Migne’s ed. Tom. i., P. II.,

long career as public teacher at Athens and Constantinople, returned to his native Antioch
and had the misfortune to outlive the revival of heathenism under Julian and to lament the
triumph of Christianity under his successors. He was introduced by him into a knowledge
of the Greek classics and the arts of rhetoric, which served him a good purpose for his future
labors in the church. He was his best scholar, and when Libanius, shortly before his death
(about 393), was asked whom he wished for his successor, he replied: “John, if only the
Christians had not stolen him from us.”4</p>
<p>After the completion of his studies Chrysostom became a rhetorician, and began the
profitable practice of law, which opened to him a brilliant political career. The amount of
litigation was enormous. The display of talent in the law-courts was the high-road to the
dignities of vice-prefect, prefect, and consul. Some of his speeches at the bar excited admiration
and were highly commended by Libanius. For some time, as he says, he was “a neverfailing
attendant at the courts of law, and passionately fond of the theatre.” But he was not
satisfied. The temptations of a secular profession in a corrupt state of society discouraged
him. To accept a fee for making the worse cause appear the better cause, seemed to him to
be taking Satan’s wages.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.—His Conversion and Ascetic Life.</head>
<p>The quiet study of the Scriptures, the example of his pious mother, the acquaintance
with Bishop Meletius, and the influence of his intimate friend Basil, who was of the same
age and devoted to ascetic life, combined to produce a gradual change in his character.5</p>
<p>He entered the class of catechumens, and after the usual period of three years of instruction
and probation, he was baptized by Meletius in his twenty-third year (369 or 370). From
this time on, says Palladius, “he neither swore, nor defamed any one, nor spoke falsely, nor
cursed, nor even tolerated facetious jokes.” His baptism was, as in the case of St. Augustin,
the turning point in his life, an entire renunciation of this world and dedication to the service
of Christ. The change was radical and permanent.</p>
<p>Meletius, who foresaw the future greatness of the young lawyer, wished to secure him
for the active service of the church, and ordained him to the subordinate office of rector
(anagnostes, reader), about A.D. 370. The rectors had to read the Scripture lessons in the
first part of divine service (the “Missa Catechumenorum”), and to call upon the people to
pray, but could not preach nor distribute the sacraments.</p>
<p>The first inclination of Chrysostom after baptism was to adopt the monastic life as the
safest mode, according to the prevailing notions of the church in that age, to escape the
temptations and corruptions of the world, to cultivate holiness and to secure the salvation
of the soul. But the earnest entreaties of his mother prevailed on him to delay the gratification
of his desire. He relates the scene with dramatic power. She took him to her chamber, and
by the bed where she had given him birth, she adjured him with tears not to forsake her.
“My son,” she said in substance, “my only comfort in the midst of the miseries of this earthly
life is to see thee constantly, and to behold in thy features the faithful image of my beloved
husband who is no more. This comfort commenced with your infancy before you could
speak. I ask only one favor from you: do not make me a widow a second time; wait at least
till I die; perhaps I shall soon leave this world. When you have buried me and joined my
ashes with those of your father, nothing will then prevent you from retiring into monastic
life. But as long as I breathe, support me by your presence, and do not draw down upon you
the wrath of God by bringing such evils upon me who have given you no offense.”6</p>
<p>These tender, simple and impressive words suggest many heart-rending scenes caused
by the ascetic enthusiasm for separation from the sacred ties of the family. It is honorable
<note type="footnote">5 Socrates and Kurtz (in the 10th edition of his Kirchengeschichte, I. 223), confound this Basil with Basil the
Great of Cappadocia, who was eighteen years older than Chrysostom and died in 379. Chrysostom’s friend was
probably (as Baronius and Montfaucon conjecture) identical with Basil, bishop of Raphanea in Syria, near Antioch,
who attended the Council of Constantinople in 381. Comp. Stephens, l. c. p. 14; and Venables in Smith

to Chrysostom that he yielded to the reasonable wishes of his devoted mother. He remained
at home, but turned his home into a monastery. He secluded himself from the world and
practiced a rigid asceticism. He ate little and seldom, and only the plainest food, slept on
the bare floor and frequently rose to prayer. He kept almost unbroken silence to prevent a
relapse into the habit of slander.</p>
<p>His former associates at the bar called him unsociable and morose. But two of his fellowpupils
under Libanius joined him in his ascetic life, Maximus (afterwards bishop of Seleucia),
and Theodore of Mopsuestia. They studied the Scriptures under the direction of Diodorus
(afterwards bishop of Tarsus), the founder of the Antiochian school of theology, of which
Chrysostom and Theodore became the chief ornaments.7</p>
<p>Theodore was warmly attached to a young lady named Hermione, and resolved to marry
and to leave the ascetic brotherhood. This gave rise to the earliest treatise of Chrysostom—
namely, an exhortation to Theodore, in two letters.8 He plied all his oratorical arts
of sad sympathy, tender entreaty, bitter reproach, and terrible warning, to reclaim his friend
to what he thought the surest and safest way to heaven. To sin, he says, is human, but to
persist in sin is devilish; to fall is not ruinous to the soul, but to remain on the ground is.
The appeal had its desired effect; Theodore resumed his monastic life and became afterwards
bishop of Mopsuestia in Cilicia and one of the first biblical scholars. The arguments which
Chrysostom used, would condemn all who broke their monastic vows. They retain moral
force only if we substitute apostasy from faith for apostasy from monasticism, which must
be regarded as a temporary and abnormal or exceptional form of Christian life.</p>
<note type="footnote">7 Socrates and Sozomenus represent Diodor and Karterius as abbots under whom Chrysostom lived as monk,
but Neander (in the 3d ed. I. 29) thinks it more likely that Chrysostom was previously instructed by Diodor at
Antioch.</note>
<note type="footnote">8 Parænesis ad Theodorum Lapsum, in Migne’s ed. I., Pars I. 277–319. The second letter is milder than the

<head>CHAPTER IV.—Chrysostom Evades Election to a Bishopric, and Writes His Work
on the Priesthood.</head>
<p>About this time several bishoprics were vacant in Syria, and frequent depositions took
place with the changing fortunes of orthodoxy and Arianism, and the interference of the
court. The attention of the clergy and the people turned to Chrysostom and his friend Basil
as suitable candidates for the episcopal office, although they had not the canonical age of
thirty. Chrysostom shrunk from the responsibilities and avoided an election by a pious
fraud. He apparently assented to an agreement with Basil that both should either accept, or
resist the burden of the episcopate, but instead of that he concealed himself and put forward
his friend whom he accounted much more worthy of the honor. Basil, under the impression
that Chrysostom had already been consecrated, reluctantly submitted to the election. When
he discovered the cheat, he upbraided his friend with the breach of compact, but Chrysostom
laughed and rejoiced at the success of his plot. This conduct, which every sound Christian
conscience must condemn, caused no offense among the Christians of that age, still less
among the heathen, and was regarded as good management or “economy.” The moral
character of the deception was supposed to depend altogether on the motive, which made
it good or bad. Chrysostom appealed in justification of laudable deception to the stratagems
of war, the conduct of physicians in dealing with refractory patients, to several examples of
the Old Testament (Abraham, Jacob, David), and to the conduct of the Apostle Paul in circumcising
Timothy for the sake of the Jews (Acts xvi. 3) and in observing the ceremonial
law in Jerusalem at the advice of James (Acts xxi. 26).</p>
<p>The Jesuitical maxim, “the end justifies the means,” is much older than Jesuitism, and
runs through the whole apocryphal, pseudo-prophetic, pseudo-apostolic, pseudo-Clementine
and pseudo-Isidorian literature of the early centuries. Several of the best Fathers show a
surprising want of a strict sense of veracity. They introduce a sort of cheat even into their
strange theory of redemption, by supposing that the Devil caused the crucifixion under the
delusion that Christ was a mere man, and thus lost his claim upon the fallen race. Origen,
Chrysostom, and Jerome explain the offense of the collision between Paul and Peter at Antioch
(Gal. ii. 11 sqq.) away by turning it into a theatrical and hypocritical farce, which was
shrewdly arranged by the two apostles for the purpose of convincing the Jewish Christians
that circumcision was not necessary. Against such wretched exegesis the superior moral
sense of Augustin rightly protested, and Jerome changed his view on this particular passage.
Here is a point where the modern standard of ethics is far superior to that of the Fathers,
and more fully accords with the spirit of the New Testament, which inculcates the strictest
veracity as a fundamental virtue.9</p>

<pb n="13"/>
<p>The escape from the episcopate was the occasion for one of the best and most popular
works of Chrysostom, the Six Books On the Priesthood, which he wrote probably before his
ordination (between 375 and 381), or during his diaconate (between 381 and 386). It is
composed in the form of a Platonic dialogue between Chrysostom and Basil. He first vindicates
by argument and examples his well-meant but untruthful conduct towards his friend,
and the advantages of timely fraud; and then describes with youthful fervor and eloquence
the importance, duties and trials of the Christian ministry, without distinguishing between
the priestly and the episcopal office. He elevates it above all other offices. He requires wholesouled
consecration to Christ and love to his flock. He points to the Scriptures (quoting also
from the Apocrypha) as the great weapon of the minister. He assumes, as may be expected,
the then prevailing conception of a real priesthood and sacrifice, baptismal regeneration,
the corporal presence, the virtue of absolution, prayers for the dead, but is silent about pope
and councils, the orders of the clergy, prayers to saints, forms of prayer, priestly vestments,
incense, crosses and other doctrines and ceremonies of the Greek and Roman churches. He
holds up St. Paul as a model for imitation. The sole object of the preacher must be to please
God rather than men (Gal. i. 10). “He must not indeed despise approving demonstrations,
but as little must he court them, nor trouble himself when they are withheld.” He should
combine the qualities of dignity and humility, authority and sociability, impartiality and
courtesy, independence and lowliness, strength and gentleness, and keep a single eye to the
glory of Christ and the welfare of the church.</p>
<p>This book is the most useful or at least the best known among the works of Chrysostom,
and is well calculated to inspire a profound sense of the tremendous responsibilities of the
ministry. But it has serious defects, besides the objectionable justification of pious fraud,
and cannot satisfy the demands of an evangelical minister. In all that pertains to the proper
care of souls it is inferior to the “Reformed Pastor” of Richard Baxter.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.—Chrysostom as a Monk. a.d. 374–381.</head>
<p>After the death of his mother, Chrysostom fled from the seductions and tumults of city
life to the monastic solitude of the mountains south of Antioch, and there spent six happy
years in theological study and sacred meditation and prayer. Monasticism was to him (as
to many other great teachers of the church, and even to Luther) a profitable school of spiritual
experience and self-government. He embraced this mode of life as “the true philosophy”
from the purest motives, and brought into it intellect and cultivation enough to make the
seclusion available for moral and spiritual growth.10</p>
<p>He gives us a lively description of the bright side of this monastic life. The monks lived
in separate cells or huts (κ€λυβαι), but according to a common rule and under the authority
of an abbot. They wore coarse garments of camel’s hair or goat’s hair over their linen tunics.
They rose before sunrise, and began the day by singing a hymn of praise and common
prayer under the leadership of the abbot. Then they went to their allotted task, some to read,
others to write, others to manual labor for the support of the poor. Four hours in each day
were devoted to prayer and singing. Their only food was bread and water, except in case of
sickness. They slept on straw couches, free from care and anxiety. There was no need of
bolts and bars. They held all things in common, and the words of “mine and thine,” which
cause innumerable strifes in the world, were unknown among the brethren. If one died, he
caused no lamentation, but thanksgiving, and was carried to the grave amidst hymns of
praise; for he was not dead, but “perfected,” and permitted to behold the face of Christ. For
them to live was Christ, and to die was gain.</p>
<p>Chrysostom was an admirer of active and useful monasticism, and warns against the
dangers of idle contemplation. He shows that the words of our Lord, “One thing is needful;”
“Take no anxious thought for the morrow;” “Labor not for the meat that perisheth,” do not
inculcate total abstinence from work, but only undue anxiety about worldly things, and
must be harmonized with the apostolic exhortation to labor and to do good. He defends
monastic seclusion on account of the prevailing immorality in the cities, which made it almost
impossible to cultivate there a higher Christian life.</p>
<p>In this period, from 374 to 381, Chrysostom composed his earliest writings in praise of
monasticism and celibacy.11 The letters “to the fallen Theodore,” have already been mentioned.
The three books against the Opponents of Monasticism were occasioned by a decree
of the Arian Emperor Valens in 373, which aimed at the destruction of that system and
compelled the monks to discharge their duties to the state by military or civil service.
Chrysostom regarded this decree as a sacrilege, and the worst kind of persecution.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.—Chrysostom as Deacon, Priest and Preacher at Antioch. a.d.
381–398.</head>
<p>By excessive self-mortifications John undermined his health, and returned to Antioch.
There he was immediately ordained deacon by Meletius in 380 or 381, and a few years afterwards
presbyter by Flavian (386).</p>
<p>As deacon he had the best opportunity to become acquainted with the practical needs
of the population, the care of the poor and the sick. After his ordination to the priesthood
he preached in the presence of the bishop his first sermon to a vast crowd. It abounds in
flowery Asiatic eloquence, in humble confession of his own unworthiness, and exaggerated
praise of Meletius and Flavian.12</p>
<p>He now entered upon a large field of usefulness, the real work of his life. The pulpit was
his throne, and he adorned it as much as any preacher of ancient or modern times.</p>
<p>Antioch was one of the great capitals of the Roman empire along with Alexandria,
Constantinople, and Rome. Nature and art combined to make it a delightful residence,
though it was often visited by inundations and earthquakes. An abundance of pure water
from the river Orontes, a large lake and the surrounding hills, fertile plains, the commerce
of the sea, imposing buildings of Asiatic, Greek, and Roman architecture, rich gardens,
baths, and colonnaded streets, were among its chief attractions. A broad street of four miles,
built by Antiochus Epiphanes, traversed the city from east to west; the spacious colonnades
on either side were paved with red granite. Innumerable lanterns illuminated the main
thoroughfares at night. The city was supplied with good schools and several churches; the
greatest of them, in which Chrysostom preached, was begun by the Emperor Constantine
and finished by Constantius. The inhabitants were Syrians, Greeks, Jews, and Romans. The
Asiatic element prevailed. The whole population amounted, as Chrysostom states, to 200,000,
of whom one half were nominally Christians. Heathenism was therefore still powerful as to
numbers, but as a religion it had lost all vitality. This was shown by the failure of the attempt
of the Emperor Julian the Apostate to revive the sacrifices to the gods. When he endeavored
in 362 to restore the oracle of Apollo Daphneus in the famous cypress grove at Antioch and
arranged for a magnificent procession, with libation, dances, and incense, he found in the
temple one solitary old priest, and this priest ominously offered in sacrifice—a goose! Julian
himself relates this ludicrous farce, and vents his anger at the Antiochians for squandering
the rich incomes of the temple upon Christianity and worldly amusements.</p>
<p>Chrysostom gives us in his sermons lively pictures of the character of the people and
the condition of the church. The prevailing vices even among Christians were avarice, luxury,
sensuality, and excessive love of the circus and the theatre. “So great,” he says, “is the depravity
of the times, that if a stranger were to compare the precepts of the gospel with the actual
<note type="footnote">12 Migne, III. 693 sqq.</note>

<pb n="16"/>
practice of society, he would infer that men were not the disciples, but the enemies of Christ.”
Gibbon thus describes the morals of Antioch:13 “The warmth of the climate disposed the
natives to the most intemperate enjoyment of tranquility and opulence, and the lively licentiousness
of the Greeks was blended with the hereditary softness of the Syrians. Fashion
was the only law, pleasure the only pursuit, and the splendor of dress and furniture was the
only distinction of the citizens of Antioch. The arts of luxury were honored, the serious and
manly virtues were the subject of ridicule, and the contempt for female modesty and reverent
age announced the universal corruption of the capital of the East. The love of spectacles was
the taste, or rather passion of the Syrians; the most skilful artists were procured from the
adjacent cities. A considerable share of the revenue was devoted to the public amusements,
and the magnificence of the games of the theatre and circus was considered as the happiness
and as the glory of Antioch.”</p>
<p>The church of Antioch was rent for eighty-five years (330–415) by heresy and schism.
There were three parties and as many rival bishops. The Meletians, under the lead of Meletius,
were the party of moderate orthodoxy holding the Nicene Creed; the Arians, headed by
Eudoxius, and supported by the Emperor Valens, denied the eternal divinity of Christ; the
Eustathians, under the venerated priest Paulinus, were in communion with Athanasius, but
were accused of Sabellianism, which maintained the Divine unity and strict deity of Christ
and the Holy Spirit, but denied the tri-personality except in the form of three modes of selfrevelation.
Pope Damasus declared for Paulinus and condemned Meletius as a heretic. Alexandria
likewise sided against him. Meletius was more than once banished from his see,
and recalled. He died during the sessions of the Council of Constantinople, 381, over which
he presided for a while. His remains were carried with great solemnities to Antioch and
buried by the side of Babylas the Martyr. Chrysostom reconciled Flavian, the successor of
Meletius, with Alexandria and Rome in 398. Alexander, the successor of Flavian, led the
Eustathians back into the orthodox church in 415, and thus unity was restored.</p>
<p>Chrysostom preached Sunday after Sunday and during Lent, sometimes twice or oftener
during the week, even five days in succession, on the duties and responsibilities of Christians,
and fearlessly attacked the immorality of the city. He declaimed with special severity against
the theatre and the chariot-races; and yet many of his hearers would run from his sermons
to the circus to witness those exciting spectacles with the same eagerness as Jews and Gentiles.
He exemplified his preaching by a blameless life, and soon acquired great reputation and
won the love of the whole congregation. Whenever he preached the church was crowded.
He had to warn his hearers against pickpockets, who found an inviting harvest in these
dense audiences.</p>
<note type="footnote">13 Decline and Fall, ch. xxiv.</note>

<pb n="17"/>
<p>A serious disturbance which took place during his career at Antioch, called forth a remarkable
effort of his oratorical powers. The populace of the city, provoked by excessive
taxes, rose in revolt against the Emperor Theodosius the Great, broke down his statues and
those of his deceased excellent wife Flacilla (d. 385) and his son Arcadius, dragged the
fragments through the streets, and committed other acts of violence. The Emperor threatened
to destroy the whole city. This caused general consternation and agony, but the city was
saved by the intercession of Bishop Flavian, who in his old age proceeded to Constantinople
and secured free pardon from the Emperor. Although a man of violent temper, Theodosius
had profound reverence for bishops, and on another occasion he submitted to the rebuke
of St. Ambrose for the wholesale massacre of the Thessalonians (390).</p>
<p>In this period of public anxiety, which lasted several months, Chrysostom delivered
series of extempore orations, in which he comforted the people and exhorted them to correct
their vices. These are his twenty-one Homilies on the Statues, so-called from the overthrow
of the imperial statues which gave rise to them. They were preached during Lent 387.14 In
the same year St. Augustin submitted to baptism at the hands of St. Ambrose in Milan. One
of the results of those sermons was the conversion of a large number of heathens. Thus the
calamity was turned into a blessing to the church.</p>
<p>During the sixteen or seventeen years of his labors in Antioch Chrysostom wrote the
greater part of his Homilies and Commentaries; a consolatory Epistle to the despondent
Stagirius; the excellent book on the martyr Babylas, which illustrates by a striking example
the divine power of Christianity; a treatise on Virginity, which he puts above marriage; and
an admonition to a young widow on the glory of widowhood, and the duty of continuing
in it. He disapproved of second marriage, not as sinful or illegal, but as inconsistent with
an ideal conception of marriage and a high order of piety.15</p>
<note type="footnote">14 Montfaucon goes with tedious minuteness into the chronology of these sermons. The twentieth was delivered
ten days before Easter, the twenty-first on Easter, after the return of Flavian from Rome with the Emperor’s
pardon. The first sermon was preached shortly before the sedition and has nothing to do with it, but is alluded
to in the second. It is a temperance sermon, based on Paul’s advice to Timothy, 1 Tim. v. 23, where he emphasized
the word “little” and the “often infirmities.”</note>

<head>CHAPTER VII.—Chrysostom as Patriarch of Constantinople. a.d. 398–404.</head>
<p>After the death of Nectarius (successor to Gregory Nazianzen), towards the end of the
year 397, Chrysostom was chosen, entirely without his own agency and even against his
remonstrance, archbishop of Constantinople. He was hurried away from Antioch by a military
escort, to avoid a commotion in the congregation and to make resistance useless. He
was consecrated Feb. 26, 398, by his enemy Theophilus, patriarch of Alexandria, who reluctantly
yielded to the command of the Emperor Arcadius or rather his prime minister, the
eunuch Eutropius, and nursed his revenge for a more convenient season.</p>
<p>Constantinople, built by Constantine the Great in 330, on the site of Byzantium, assumed
as the Eastern capital of the Roman empire the first position among the episcopal sees of
the East, and became the centre of court theology, court intrigues, and theological controversies.
The second oecumenical council, which was held there in 381, under Theodosius
the Great, the last Roman emperor worthy of the name (d. 395), decided the victory of
Nicene orthodoxy over the Arian heresy, and gave the bishop of Constantinople a primacy
of honor, next in rank to the bishop of old Rome—a position which was afterwards confirmed
by the Council of Chalcedon in 451, but disputed by Pope Leo and his successors.</p>
<p>Chrysostom soon gained by his eloquent sermons the admiration of the people, of the
weak Emperor Arcadius, and, at first, even of his wife Eudoxia, with whom he afterwards
waged a deadly war. He extended his pastoral care to the Goths who were becoming numerous
in Constantinople, had a part of the Bible translated for them, often preached to them
himself through an interpreter, and sent missionaries to the Gothic and Scythian tribes on
the Danube. He continued to direct by correspondence those missionary operations even
during his exile. For a short time he enjoyed the height of power and popularity.</p>
<p>But he also made enemies by his denunciations of the vices and follies of the clergy and
aristocracy. He emptied the episcopal palace of its costly plate and furniture and sold it for
the benefit of the poor and the hospitals. He introduced his strict ascetic habits and reduced
the luxurious household of his predecessors to the strictest simplicity. He devoted his large
income to benevolence. He refused invitations to banquets, gave no dinner parties, and ate
the simplest fare in his solitary chamber.16 He denounced unsparingly luxurious habits in
eating and dressing, and enjoined upon the rich the duty of almsgiving to an extent that
tended to increase rather than diminish the number of beggars who swarmed in the streets
and around the churches and public baths. He disciplined the vicious clergy and opposed
the perilous and immoral habit of unmarried priests of living under the same roof with
“spiritual Sisters” (συνείσακται). This habit dated from an earlier age, and was a reaction
against celibacy. Cyprian had raised his protest against it, and the Council of Nicæa forbade

it to his rigid abstinence. His enemies construed it as pride, and based upon it a serious accusation.</note>

unmarried priests to live with any females except close relations. Chrysostom’s unpopularity
was increased by his irritability and obstinacy, and his subservience to a proud and violent
archdeacon, Serapion. The Empress Eudoxia was jealous of his influence over Arcadius and
angry at his uncompromising severity against sin and vice. She became the chief instrument
of his downfall.</p>
<p>The occasion was furnished by an unauthorized use of his episcopal power beyond the
lines of his diocese, which was confined to the city. At the request of the clergy of Ephesus
and the neighboring bishops, he visited that city in January, 401, held a synod and deposed
six bishops convicted of shameful simony. During his absence of several months he left the
episcopate of Constantinople in the hands of Severian, bishop of Gabala, an unworthy and
adroit flatterer, who basely betrayed his trust and formed a cabal headed by the empress
and her licentious court ladies, for the ruin of Chrysostom. On his return he used unguarded
language in the pulpit, and spoke on Elijah’s relation to Jezebel in such a manner that Eudoxia
understood it as a personal insult. The clergy were anxious to get rid of a bishop who
was too severe for their lax morals.</p>

<pb n="20"/>
<head>CHAPTER VIII.—Chrysostom and Theophilus. His First Deposition and Banishment.</head>
<p>At this time Chrysostom became involved in the Origenistic controversies which are
among the most violent and most useless in ancient church history, and full of personal
invective and calumny.17 The object in dispute was the orthodoxy of the great Origen, which
long after his death was violently defended and as violently assailed.</p>
<p>Theophilus of Alexandria, an able and vigorous but domineering, contentious and unscrupulous
prelate, was at first an admirer of Origen, but afterwards in consequence of a
personal quarrel joined the opponents, condemned his memory and banished the Origenistic
monks from Egypt. Some fifty of them, including the four “Tall Brethren,” so-called
on account of their extraordinary stature, fled to Constantinople and were hospitably received
by Chrysostom (401). He had no sympathy with the philosophical speculations of Origen,
but appreciated his great merits, and felt that injustice was done to the persecuted monks.
He interceded in their behalf with Theophilus, who replied with indignant remonstrance
against protecting heretics and interfering in another diocese.</p>
<p>Theophilus, long desirous of overthrowing Chrysostom, whom he had reluctantly
consecrated, set every instrument in motion to take revenge. He sent the octogenarian
bishop Epiphanius of Salamis, a well-meaning and learned but bigoted zealot for orthodoxy,
to Constantinople, as a tool of his hierarchical plans (402); but Epiphanius soon returned
and died on the ship (403). Theophilus now traveled himself to Constantinople, accompanied
by a body-guard of rough sailors and provided with splendid presents. He appeared at once
as accuser and judge, aided by Eudoxia and the disaffected clergy. He held a secret council
of thirty-six bishops, all of them Egyptians except seven, in a suburb of Chalcedon on the
Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, and procured in this so-called synod at the Oak, the deposition
and banishment of Chrysostom, on false charges of immorality and high treason (403).
Among the twenty-nine charges were these: that Chrysostom had called the saintly Epiphanius
a fool and a demon, that he abused the clergy, that he received females without
witnesses, that he ate sumptuously alone and bathed alone, that he had compared the empress
to Jezebel.</p>
<p>The innocent bishop refused to appear before a packed synod of his enemies, and appealed
to a general council. As the sentence of banishment for life became known, the indignation
of the people was immense. A single word from him would have raised an insurrection;
but he surrendered himself freely to the imperial officers, who conveyed him in the dark to
the harbor and put him on board a ship destined for Hieron at the mouth of the Pontus.
Theophilus entered the city in triumph and took vengeance on Chrysostom’s friends.</p>
<note type="footnote">17 Schaff, Church History, III. 698 sqq.</note>

<pb n="21"/>
<p>The people besieged the palace and demanded the restoration of their bishop. Constantinople
was almost in a state of insurrection. The following night the city was convulsed
by an earthquake, which was felt with peculiar violence in the bedroom of Eudoxia and
frightened her into submission. She implored the emperor to avert the wrath of God by recalling
Chrysostom. Messengers were despatched with abject apologies to bring him back.
A whole fleet of barks put forth to greet him, the Bosphorus blazed with torches and resounded
with songs of rejoicing. On passing the gates he was borne aloft by the people to the
church, seated in the episcopal chair and forced to make an address. His triumph was
complete, but of short duration. Theophilus felt unsafe in Constantinople and abruptly
sailed in the night for Alexandria. The feelings with which Chrysostom went into his first
and second exile, he well describes in a letter to Bishop Cyriacus: “when I was driven from
the city, I felt no anxiety, but said to myself: If the empress wishes to banish me, let her do
so; ‘the earth is the Lord’s.’ If she wants to have me sawn asunder, I have Isaiah for an example.
If she wants me to be drowned in the ocean, I think of Jonah. If I am to be thrown
into the fire, the three men in the furnace suffered the same. If cast before wild beasts, I remember
Daniel in the lion’s den. If she wants me to be stoned, I have before me Stephen,
the first martyr. If she demands my head, let her do so; John the Baptist shines before me.
Naked I came from my mother’s womb, naked shall I leave this world. Paul reminds me, ‘If
I still pleased men, I would not be the servant of Christ.’”</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.—Chrysostom and Eudoxia. His Second Banishment, a.d. 403.</head>
<p>The restored patriarch and the repentant empress seemed reconciled, and vied with one
another in extravagant laudations for two months, when the feud broke out afresh and
ended in perpetual exile and death.</p>
<p>Eudoxia was a beautiful, imperious, intriguing and revengeful woman, who despised
her husband and indulged her passions. Not content with the virtual rule of the Roman
empire, she aspired to semi-divine honors, which used to be paid to the heathen Cæsars. A
column of porphyry with her silver statue for public adoration was erected in September,
403, on the forum before the church of St. Sophia, and dedicated amid boisterous and licentious
revelry, which disturbed the sacred services.</p>
<p>Chrysostom ascended the pulpit on the commemoration day of the martyrdom of John
the Baptist, and thundered his righteous indignation against all who shared in these profane
amusements, the people, the prefect, and the haughty woman on the throne. In the heat of
his zeal the imprudent words are said to have escaped his lips: “Again Herodias is raging,
again she is dancing, again she demands the head of John on a platter.”18 The comparison
of Eudoxia with Herodias, and himself (John) with John the Baptist was even more directly
personal than his former allusion to the relation of Jezebel and Elijah. Whether he really
spoke these or similar words is at least doubtful, but they were reported to Eudoxia, who as
a woman and an empress could never forgive such an insult. She demanded from the emperor
signal redress. In the conflict of imperial and episcopal authority the former achieved
a physical and temporary, the latter a moral and enduring victory.</p>
<p>The enemies of Chrysostom flocked like vultures down to their prey. Theophilus directed
the plot from a safe distance. Arcadius was persuaded to issue an order for the removal of
Chrysostom. He continued to preach and refused to leave the church over which God had
placed him, but had to yield to armed force. He was dragged by imperial guards from the
cathedral on the vigil of the resurrection in 404, while the sacrament of baptism was being
administered to hundreds of catechumens. “The waters of regeneration,” says Palladius,
“were stained with blood.” The female candidates, half dressed, were driven by licentious
soldiers into the dark streets. The eucharistic elements were profaned by pagan hands. The
clergy in their priestly robes were ejected and chased through the city. The horrors of that
night were long afterwards remembered with a shudder. During the greater part of the
Easter week the city was kept in a state of consternation. Private dwellings were invaded,

'Ιω€ννου ξητεῖ λαβεῖν (comp. Mark vi. 25), is unworthy of his pen and rejected as spurious by Tillemont, Savile

construed by his enemies in that way. See Neander, II. 177 sq.</note>

and suspected Joannites—the partisans of Chrysostom—thrown into prison, scourged and
tortured. Chrysostom, who was shut up in his episcopal palace, twice narrowly escaped assassination.</p>
<p>At last on June 5, 404, the timid and long hesitating Arcadius signed the edict of banishment.
Chrysostom received it with calm submission, and after a final prayer in the cathedral
with some of his faithful bishops, and a tender farewell to his beloved Olympias and her
attendant deaconesses, he surrendered himself to the guards and was conveyed at night to
the Asiatic shore. He had scarcely left the city, when the cathedral was consumed by fire.
The charge of incendiarism was raised against his friends, but neither threats, nor torture
and mutilation could elicit a confession of guilt. He refused to acknowledge Arsacius and
Atticus as his successors; and this was made a crime punishable with degradation, fine and
imprisonment. The clergy who continued faithful to him were deposed and banished. Pope
Innocent of Rome was appealed to, pronounced the synod which had condemned Chrysostom
irregular, annulled the deposition, and wrote him a letter of sympathy, and urged upon
Arcadius the convocation of a general council, but without effect.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.—Chrysostom in Exile. His Death. a.d. 404–407.</head>
<p>Chrysostom was conveyed under the scorching heat of July and August over Galatia
and Cappadocia, to the lonely mountain village Cucusus, on the borders of Cilicia and Armenia,
which the wrath of Eudoxia had selected for his exile. The climate was inclement
and variable, the winter severe, the place was exposed to Isaurian brigands. He suffered
much from fever and headache, and was more than once brought to the brink of the grave.
Nevertheless the bracing mountain air invigorated his feeble constitution, and he was
hopeful of returning to his diocese. He was kindly treated by the bishop of Cucusus. He received
visits, letters and presents from faithful friends, and by his correspondence exerted
a wider influence from that solitude than from the episcopal throne.</p>
<p>His 242 extant letters are nearly all from the three years of his exile, and breathe a noble
Christian spirit, in a clear, brilliant and persuasive style. They exhibit his faithful care for
all the interests of the church and look calmly and hopefully to the glories of heaven. They
are addressed to Eastern and Western bishops, presbyters, deacons, deaconesses, monks
and missionaries; they describe the fatigues of his journey, give advice on a variety of subjects,
strengthen and comfort his distant flock, urge the destruction of heathen temples in
Phoenicia, the extirpation of heresy in Cyprus, and encourage the missions in Persia and
Scythia.19 Two letters are addressed to the Roman bishop Innocent I., whose sympathy and
assistance he courted. Seventeen letters—the most important of all—are addressed to
Olympias, the deaconess, a widow of noble birth, personal beauty and high accomplishments,
who devoted her fortune and time to the poor and the sick. She died between 408 and 420.
To her he revealed his inner life, upon her virtues he lavished extravagant praise, which offends
modern taste as fulsome flattery. For her consolation he wrote a special treatise on
the theme that “No one is really injured except by himself.”20</p>
<p>The cruel empress, stung by disappointment at the continued power of the banished
bishop, forbade all correspondence and ordered his transfer by two brutal guards, first to
Arabissus, then to Pityus on the Caucasus, the most inhospitable spots in the empire.</p>
<p>The journey of three months on foot was a slow martyrdom to the feeble and sickly old
man. He did not reach his destination, but ended his pilgrimage five or six miles from
Comana in Pontus in the chapel of the martyr Basiliscus on the 14th of September, 407, in
his sixtieth year, the tenth of his episcopate. Clothed in his white baptismal robes, he partook

of the eucharist and commended his soul to God. His last words were his accustomed doxology,
the motto of his life: “Glory be to God for all things, Amen.”21</p>
<p>He was buried by the side of Basiliscus in the presence of monks and nuns.</p>
<p>He was revered as a saint by the people. Thirty-one years afterwards, January 27, 438,
his body was translated with great pomp to Constantinople and deposited with the emperors
and patriarchs beneath the altar of the church of the Holy Apostles. The young Emperor
Theodosius II. and his sister Pulcheria met the procession at Chalcedon, kneeled down before
the coffin, and in the name of their guilty parents implored the forgiveness of heaven for
the grievous injustice done to the greatest and saintliest man that ever graced the pulpit and
episcopal chair of Constantinople. The Eastern church of that age shrunk from the bold
speculations of Origen, but revered the narrow orthodoxy of Epiphanius and the ascetic
piety of Chrysostom.</p>
<p>The personal appearance of the golden-mouthed orator was not imposing, but dignified
and winning. He was of small stature (like David, Paul, Athanasius, Melanchthon, John
Wesley, Schleiermacher). He had an emaciated frame, a large, bald head, a lofty, wrinkled
forehead, deep-set, bright, piercing eyes, pallid, hollow cheeks, and a short, gray beard.22</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.—His Character.</head>
<p>Chrysostom was one of those rare men who combine greatness and goodness, genius
and piety, and continue to exercise by their writings and example a happy influence upon
the Christian church. He was a man for his time and for all times. But we must look at the
spirit rather than the form of his piety, which bore the stamp of his age.</p>
<p>He took Paul for his model, but had a good deal of the practical spirit of James, and of
the fervor and loveliness of John. The Scriptures were his daily food, and he again and again
recommended their study to laymen as well as ministers. He was not an ecclesiastical
statesman, like St. Ambrose, not a profound divine like St. Augustin, but a pure man, a
practical Christian, and a king of preachers. “He carried out in his own life,” says Hase, “as
far as mortal man can do it, the ideal of the priesthood which he once described in youthful
enthusiasm.” He considered it the duty of every Christian to promote the spiritual welfare
of his fellowmen. “Nothing can be more chilling,” he says in the 20th Homily on Acts, “than
the sight of a Christian who makes no effort to save others. Neither poverty, nor humble
station, nor bodily infirmity can exempt men and women from the obligation of this great
duty. To hide our light under pretense of weakness is as great an insult to God as if we were
to say that He could not make His sun to shine.”</p>
<p>It is very much to his praise that in an age of narrow orthodoxy and doctrinal intolerance
he cherished a catholic and irenical spirit. He by no means disregarded the value of theological
soundness, and was in hearty agreement with the Nicene creed, which triumphed over
the Arians during his ministry in Antioch; he even refused a church in Constantinople which
the Arian Goths claimed. But he took no share in the persecution of heretics, and even
sheltered the Origenistic monks against the violence of Theophilus of Alexandria. He hated
sin more than error, and placed charity above orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Like all the Nicene Fathers, he was an enthusiast for ascetic and monastic virtue, which
shows itself in seclusion rather than in transformation of the world and the natural ordinances
of God. He retained as priest and bishop his cloister habits of simplicity, abstemiousness
and unworldliness. He presents the most favorable aspect of that mode of life, which must
be regarded as a wholesome reaction against the hopeless corruption of pagan society. He
thought with St. Paul that he could best serve the Lord in single life, and no one can deny
that he was unreservedly devoted to the cause of religion.23</p>
<note type="footnote">23 Luther’s intense aversion to monkery, although he himself passed through its discipline, must be taken
into account in his unfavorable judgments of Chrysostom, Jerome and other Fathers except St. Augustin, whom
he esteemed very highly. Of Chrysostom he must have read very little, or he could not have called him a “rhetorician
full of words and empty of matter.” He spoke well, however, of Theodoret’s commentaries on the Pauline
Epistles, which is an indirect testimony in favor of Chrysostom’s exegesis. See Schaff, Church Hist. vol. VI. 536.</note>

<pb n="27"/>
<p>He was not a man of affairs, and knew little of the world. He had the harmlessness of
the dove without the wisdom of the serpent. He knew human nature better than individual
men. In this respect he resembles Neander, his best biographer. Besides, he was irritable of
temper, suspicious of his enemies, and easily deceived and misled by such men as Serapion.
He showed these defects in his quarrel with the court and the aristocracy of Constantinople.
With a little more worldly wisdom and less ascetic severity he might perhaps have conciliated
and converted those whom he repelled by his pulpit fulminations. Fearless denunciation of
immorality and vice in high places always commands admiration and respect, especially in
a bishop and court preacher who is exposed to the temptations of flattery. But it is unwise
to introduce personalities into the pulpit and does more harm than good. His relation to
Eudoxia reminds one of the attitude of John Knox to Mary Stuart. The contrast between
the pure and holy zeal of the preacher and the reformer and the ambition and vanity of a
woman on the throne is very striking and must be judged by higher rules than those of gallantry
and courtesy. But after all, the conduct of Christ, the purest of the pure, towards Mary
Magdalene and the woman taken in adultery is far more sublime.</p>
<p>The conflict of Chrysostom with Eudoxia imparts to his latter life the interest of a romance,
and was over-ruled for his benefit. In his exile his character shines brighter than
even in the pulpit of Antioch and Constantinople. His character was perfected by suffering.
The gentleness, meekness, patience, endurance and devotion to his friends and his work
which he showed during the last three years of his life are the crowning glory of his career.
Though he did not die a violent death, he deserves to be numbered among the true martyrs,
who are ready for any sacrifice to the cause of virtue and piety.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XII.—The Writings of Chrysostom.</head>
<p>Chrysostom was the most fruitful author among the Greek Fathers. Suidas makes the
extravagant remark that only the omniscient God could recount all his writings. The best
have been preserved and have already been noticed in chronological order. They may be
divided into five classes: (1) Moral and ascetic treatises, including the work on the Priesthood;
(2) About six hundred Homilies and Commentaries; (3) Occasional, festal and panegyrical
orations; (4) Letters; (5) Liturgy.</p>
<p>His most important and permanently useful works are his Homilies and Commentaries,
which fill eleven of the thirteen folio volumes of the Benedictine edition. They go together;
his homilies are expository, and his commentaries are homiletical and practical. Continuous
expositions, according to chapter and verse, he wrote only on the first eight chapters of
Isaiah, and on the Epistle to the Galatians. All others are arranged in sermons with a moral
application at the close. Suidas and Cassiodorus state that he wrote commentaries on the
whole Bible. We have from him Homilies on Genesis, the Psalms, the Gospel of Matthew,
the Gospel of John, the Acts, the Pauline Epistles including the Hebrews, which he considered
Pauline. Besides, he delivered discourses on separate texts of Scripture, on church festivals,
eulogies on apostles and martyrs, sermons against the Pagans, against the Jews and Judaizing
Christians, against the Arians, and the famous twenty-one orations on the Statues.</p>
<p>He published some of his sermons himself, but most of them were taken down by shorthand
writers.24 Written sermons were the exceptions in those days. The preacher usually
was seated, the people were standing.</p>
<p>Of the letters of Chrysostom we have already spoken.</p>
<p>The Liturgy of Chrysostom so-called is an abridgment and improvement of the Liturgy
of St. Basil (d. 379), and both are descended from the Liturgy of James, which they superseded.
They have undergone gradual changes. It is impossible to determine the original text, as no
two copies precisely agree. Chrysostom frequently refers to different parts of the divine
service customary in his day, but there is no evidence that he composed a liturgy, nor is it
probable.25 The Liturgy which bears his name is still used in the orthodox Greek and Russian
church on all Sundays, except those during Lent, and on the eve of Epiphany, Easter and

<head>CHAPTER XIII.—His Theology and Exegesis.</head>
<p>Chrysostom belonged to the Antiochian school of theology and exegesis, and is its
soundest and most popular representative. It was founded by his teacher Diodor of Tarsus
(d. 393), developed by himself and his fellow-student Theodore of Mopsuestia (d. 429), and
followed by Theodoret and the Syrian and Nestorian divines. Theodore was the exegete,
Chrysostom the homilist, Theodoret the annotator. The school was afterwards condemned
for its alleged connection with the Nestorian heresy; but that connection was accidental,
not necessary. Chrysostom’s mind was not given to dogmatizing, and too well balanced to
run into heresy.</p>
<p>The Antiochian school agreed with the Alexandrian school founded by Origen, in
maintaining the divine inspiration and authority of the Scriptures, but differed from it in
the method of interpretation, and in a sharper distinction between the Old and the New
Testaments, and the divine and human elements in the same.</p>
<p>To Origen belongs the great merit of having opened the path of biblical science and
criticism, but he gave the widest scope to the allegorizing and mystical method by which
the Bible may be made to say anything that is pious and edifying.26 Philo of Alexandria had
used that method for introducing the Platonic philosophy into the Mosaic writings. Origen
was likewise a Platonist, but his chief object was to remove all that was offensive in the literal
sense. The allegorical method is imposition rather than exposition. Christ sanctions parabolic
teaching and typical, but not allegorical, interpretation. Paul uses it once or twice, but
only incidentally, when arguing from the rabbinical standpoint.</p>
<p>The Antiochian school seeks to explain the obvious grammatical and historical sense,
which is rich enough for all purposes of instruction and edification. It takes out of the Word
what is actually in it, instead of putting into it all sorts of foreign notions and fancies.</p>
<p>Chrysostom recognizes allegorizing in theory, but seldom uses it in practice, and then
more by way of rhetorical ornament and in deference to custom. He was generally guided
by sound common sense and practical wisdom. He was more free from arbitrary and absurd
interpretations than almost any other patristic commentator. He pays proper attention to
the connection, and puts himself into the psychological state and historical situation of the
writer. In one word, he comes very near to what we now call the grammatico-historical exegesis.
This is the only solid and sound foundation for any legitimate use of the Scriptures.
The sacred writers had one definite object in view; they wished to convey one particular
<note type="footnote">26 Allegorical interpretation makes the writer say something else than what he meant, ˆλλο μšν ‡γορεύει,
ˆλλο δš νοει.</note>

<pb n="30"/>
sense by the ordinary use of language, and to be clearly understood by their readers. At the
same time the truths of revelation are so deep and so rich that they can be indefinitely expanded
and applied to all circumstances and conditions. Interpretation is one thing, application
is another thing. Chrysostom knew as well as any allegorist how to derive spiritual
nourishment from the Scriptures and to make them “profitable for teaching, for reproof,
for correction, for instruction in righteousness; that the man of God may be complete,
thoroughly furnished unto every good work.”27 As to the text of the Greek Testament, he
is the chief witness of the Syro-Constantinopolitan recension, which was followed by the
later Greek Fathers.28 He accepts the Syrian canon of the Peshito, which includes the Old
Testament with the Apocrypha, but omits from the New Testament the Apocalypse and
four Catholic Epistles (2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, and Jude); at least in the Synopsis Veteris et
novi Testamenti which is found in his works, those five books are wanting, but this does not
prove that he did not know them.29</p>
<p>The commentaries of Chrysostom are of unequal merit. We must always remember
that he is a homiletical commentator who aimed at the conversion and edification of his
hearers. He makes frequent digressions and neglects to explain the difficulties of important
texts. Grammatical remarks are rare, but noteworthy on account of his familiarity with the
Greek as his mother tongue, though by no means coming up to the accuracy of a modern
expert in philology. In the Old Testament he depended altogether on the Septuagint, being
ignorant of Hebrew, and often missed the mark. The Homilies on the Pauline Epistles are
considered his best, especially those to the Corinthians, where he had to deal with moral
and pastoral questions. The doctrinal topics of Romans and Galatians were less to his taste,
and it cannot be said that he entered into the depths of Paul’s doctrines of sin and grace, or
ascended the height of his conception of freedom in Christ. His Homilies on Romans are
argumentative; his continuous notes on Galatians somewhat hasty and superficial. The
eighty Homilies on Matthew from his Antiochian period are very valuable. Thomas Aquinas
declared he would rather possess them than be the master of all Paris. The eighty-eight
Homilies on John, also preached at Antioch, but to a select audience early in the morning,

tribute to Chrysostom (p. 593): “The Christian people of ancient times never enjoyed richer instruction out of
the Bible than from the golden mouth of a genuine and thoroughly equipped biblical preacher.” Farrar calls
Chrysostom “The ablest of Christian homilists and one of the best Christian men,” and “the bright consummate
flower of the school of Antioch.”</note>

are more doctrinal and controversial, being directed against the Anomoeans (Arians).30 We
have no commentaries from him on Mark and Luke, nor on the Catholic Epistles and the
Apocalypse. The fifty-five homilies on the Acts, delivered at Constantinople between Easter
and Whitsuntide, when that book was read in the public lessons, contain much interesting
information about the manners and customs of the age, but are the least polished of his
productions. Erasmus, who translated them into Latin, doubted their genuineness. His life
in Constantinople was too much disturbed to leave him quiet leisure for preparation. The
Homilies on the Hebrews, likewise preached in Constantinople, were published after his
death from notes of his friend, the presbyter Constantine, and the text is in a confused state.</p>
<p>The Homilies of Chrysostom were a rich storehouse for the Greek commentators,
compilers and epitomizers, such as Theodoret, Oecumenius, Theophylact, and Euthymius
Zigabenus, and they are worth consulting to this day for their exegetical as well as their
practical value.</p>
<p>The theology of Chrysostom must be gathered chiefly from his commentaries. He differs
from the metaphysical divines of the Nicene age by his predominantly practical tendency,
and in this respect he approaches the genius of the Western church. He lived between the
great trinitarian and christological controversies and was only involved incidentally in the
subordinate Origenistic controversy, in which he showed a charitable and liberal spirit. He
accepted the Nicene Creed, but he died before the rise of the Nestorian and Eutychian heresies.
Speculation was not his forte, and as a thinker he is behind Athanasius, Gregory of
Nyssa, and John of Damascus. He was a rhetorician rather than a logician.</p>
<p>Like all the Greek fathers, he laid great stress on free-will and the cooperation of the
human will with divine grace in the work of conversion. Cassian, the founder of Semi-
Pelagianism, was his pupil and appealed to his authority. Julian of Eclanum, the ablest opponent
of Augustin, quoted Chrysostom against original sin; Augustin tried from several
passages to prove the reverse, but could only show that Chrysostom was no Pelagian. We
may say that in tendency and spirit he was a catholic Semi-Pelagian or Synergist before
Semi-Pelagianism was brought into a system.</p>
<p>His anthropology forms a wholesome contrast and supplement to the anthropology of
his younger contemporary, the great bishop of Hippo, the champion of the slavery of the
human will and the sovereignty of divine grace.</p>
<p>We look in vain in Chrysostom’s writings for the Augustinian and Calvinistic doctrines
of absolute predestination, total depravity, hereditary guilt, irresistible grace, perseverance
of saints, or for the Lutheran theory of forensic and solifidian justification. He teaches that
<note type="footnote">30 So called because they taught that the Son is unlike or dissimilar (‡νόμοιος) to the Father and of a different
substance, in opposition to the Nicene doctrine of equal substance (ὁμοουσία), and the semi-Arian doctrine of
like, or similar substance (ὁμοιουσία).</note>

<pb n="32"/>
God foreordained all men to holiness and salvation, and that Christ died for all and is both
willing and able to save all, but not against their will and without their free consent. The
vessels of mercy were prepared by God unto glory, the vessels of wrath were not intended
by God, but fitted by their own sin, for destruction. The will of man, though injured by the
Fall, has still the power to accept or to reject the offer of salvation. It must first obey the divine
call. “When we have begun,” he says, in commenting on John i. 38, “when we have sent our
will before, then God gives us abundant opportunities of salvation.” God helps those who
help themselves. “When God,” he says, “sees us eagerly prepare for the contest of virtue, he
instantly supplies us with his assistance, lightens our labors and strengthens the weakness
of our nature.” Faith and good works are necessary conditions of justification and salvation,
though Christ’s merits alone are the efficient cause. He remarks on John vi. 44, that while
no man can come to Christ unless drawn and taught by the Father, there is no excuse for
those who are unwilling to be thus drawn and taught. Yet on the other hand he fully admits
the necessity of divine grace at the very beginning of every good action. “We can do no good
thing at all,” he says, “except we are aided from above.” And in his dying hour he gave glory
to God “for all things.”</p>
<p>Thus Augustinians and Semi-Pelagians, Calvinists and Arminians, widely as they differ
in theory about human freedom and divine sovereignty, meet in the common feeling of
personal responsibility and absolute dependence on God. With one voice they disclaim all
merit of their own and give all glory to Him who is the giver of every good and perfect gift
and works in us “both to will and to work, for his good pleasure” (Phil. ii. 12).31</p>
<note type="footnote">31 I add the remarks of Stephens on the difference between Chrysostom and Augustin (p. 430): “Unquestionable
as the intellectual genius of Chrysostom was, yet it is rather in the purity of his moral character, his single-minded
boldness of purpose, and the glowing piety which burns through all his writings, that we find the secret of his
influence. If it was rather the mission of Augustin to mould the minds of men so as to take a firm grasp of certain
great doctrines, it was the mission of Chrysostom to inflame the whole heart with a fervent love of God. Rightly
has he been called the great teacher of consummate holiness, as Augustin was the great teacher of efficient grace;
rightly has it been remarked that, like Fénélon, he is to be ranked among those who may be termed disciples of
St. John, men who seem to have been pious without intermission from their childhood upwards, and of whose
piety the leading characteristics are ease, cheerfulness and elevation; while Augustin belongs to the disciples of
St. Paul, those who have been converted from error to truth, or from sin to holiness, and whose characteristics
are gravity , earnestness, depth. If Augustin has done more valuable service in building up the church at large,
Chrysostom is the more lovable to the individual, and speaks out of a heart overflowing to God and man, unconstrained
by the fetters of a severe and rigid system. Yet it is precisely on this account that he has not been so
generally appreciated as he deserves. His tone is too catholic for the Romanist, or for the sectarian partisan of
any denomination. ‘It would be easy to produce abundant instances of his oratorial abilities; I wish it were in
my power to record as many of his evangelical excellencies.’ Such is the verdict of a narrow-minded historian
[Milner], and the comparative estimation in which he held St. Augustin and St. Chrysostom may be inferred</note>

<pb n="33"/>
<p>As to the doctrines which separate the Greek, Roman and Protestant churches,
Chrysostom faithfully represents the Greek Catholic church prior to the separation from
Rome. In addition to the oecumenical doctrines of the Nicene Creed, he expresses strong
views on baptismal regeneration, the real presence, and the eucharistic sacrifice, yet without
a clearly defined theory, which was the result of later controversies; hence it would be unjust
to press his devotional and rhetorical language into the service of transubstantiation, or
consubstantiation, or the Roman view of the mass.32</p>
<p>His extravagant laudations of saints and martyrs promoted that refined form of idolatry
which in the Nicene age began to take the place of the heathen hero-worship. But it is all
the more remarkable that he furnishes no support to Mariolatry, which soon after his death
triumphed in the Greek as well as the Latin church. He was far from the idea of the sinless
perfection and immaculate conception of the Virgin Mary. He attributes her conduct at the
wedding of Cana (John ii. 3, 4) to undue haste, a sort of unholy ambition for the premature
display of the miraculous power of her Son; and in commenting on Matthew xii. 46–49, he
charges her and his brethren with vanity and a carnal mind.33 He does not use the term
theotokos, which twenty years after his death gave rise to the Nestorian controversy, and
which was endorsed by the third and fourth oecumenical councils.</p>
<note type="footnote">from the number of pages in his History given to each: St. Augustin is favored with 187, Chrysostom with 20.
But he whose judgment is not cramped by the shackles of some harsh and stiff theory of gospel truth will surely
allow that Chrysostom not only preached the gospel, but lived it. To the last moment of his life he exhibited that
calm, cheerful faith, that patient resignation under affliction, and untiring perseverance for the good of others,
which are preeminently the marks of a Christian saint. The cause for which he fought and died in a corrupt age
was the cause of Christian holiness.”</note>
<note type="footnote">32 In his comments on Heb. ix. 26 (Hom. XVII. on Hebrews, in the Bened. ed. XII. 241 sq.; in the Oxford
translation, p. 213), he expresses himself on the sacrificial aspect of the eucharist in these words: “Christ is our
High Priest, who offered the sacrifice that cleanses us. That sacrifice we offer now also, which was then offered,
which cannot be exhausted. This is done in remembrance of what was then done. For, saith He, ‘Do this in remembrance
of Me.’ It is not another sacrifice that we make (ποιοῦμεν), as the High Priest of old, but always the
same, or rather we perform a remembrance of a sacrifice (μ‚λλον δš ‡ν€μνησιν ἐργαζόμεθα θυσίας).” The word
remembrance would favor the Protestant rather than the Roman view, which demands an actual, though unbloody,
repetition of the sacrifice of the cross in the mass. Other passages, however, are much stronger, though highly
rhetorical, e.g., De Sacerd. III. 4: “When you behold the Lord slain, and lying there, and the priest standing over
the sacrifice and praying, and all stained with that precious blood, do you then suppose you are among men,
and standing upon earth? Are you not immediately transported to Heaven?” In another place he says, “Christ
lies slain (τεθυμ™νος) upon the altar.” And yet the people were so indifferent that Chrysostom laments: “In vain
is the daily sacrifice, in vain stand we at the altar; there is no one to take part” (Third Hom. on Ephesians).</note>
<note type="footnote">33 See his 21st Homily on John, and his 44th Homily on Matthew. Comp. Stephens, p. 417 sqq.</note>

<pb n="34"/>
<p>As to the question of the papacy he considered the bishop of Rome as the successor of
Peter, the prince of the Apostles, and appealed to him in his exile against the unjust condemnation
of the Council at the Oak. Such appeals furnished the popes with a welcome opportunity
to act as judges in the controversies of the Eastern church, and greatly strengthened
their claims. But his Epistle to Innocent was addressed also to the bishops of Milan and
Aquileia, and falls far short of the language of submission to an infallible authority. He
conceded to the pope merely a primacy of honor (προστασία, ‡ρχή), not a supremacy of
jurisdiction. He calls the bishop of Antioch (Ignatius and Flavian) likewise a successor of
Peter, who labored there according to the express testimony of Paul. In commenting on
Gal. i. 18, he represents Paul as equal in dignity (¸σότιμος) to Peter.34 He was free from
jealousy of Rome, but had he lived during the violent controversies between the patriarch
of new Rome and the pope of old Rome, it is not doubtful on which side he would have
stood.</p>
<p>In one important point Chrysostom approaches the evangelical theology of the Reformation,
his devotion to the Holy Scriptures as the only rule of faith. “There is no topic on
which he dwells more frequently and earnestly than on the duty of every Christian man and
woman to study the Bible: and what he bade others do, that he did pre-eminently himself.”35
He deemed the reading of the Bible the best means for the promotion of Christian life. A
Christian without the knowledge of the Scriptures is to him a workman without tools. Even
the sight of the Bible deters from sin, how much more the reading. It purifies and consecrates
the soul, it introduces it into the holy of holies and brings it into direct communion with
God.36</p>
<note type="footnote">34 See his letter to Innocent I. and his comments on Gal. i. and ii. The passages of Chrysostom on Peter and
his successors are collected in Berington U+0026 Kirk, The Faith of Catholics, ed. 3, vol. II. 32–35, 80, but the important
passage from his Commentary on Galatians is omitted. See Treat, The Catholic Faith (1888), p. 396.</note>

<head>CHAPTER XIV.—Chrysostom as a Preacher.</head>
<p>The crowning merit of Chrysostom is his excellency as a preacher. He is generally and
justly regarded as the greatest pulpit orator of the Greek church. Nor has he any superior
or equal among the Latin Fathers. He remains to this day a model for preachers in large
cities. He was trained in the school of Demosthenes and Libanius, and owed much of his
literary culture to the classics. He praises “the polish of Isocrates, the gravity of Demosthenes,
the dignity of Thucydides, and the sublimity of Plato.” He assigns to Plato the first rank
among the philosophers, but he places St. Paul far above him, and glories in the victory of
the tent-maker and fishermen over the wisdom of the Greeks.37</p>
<p>He was not free from the defects of the degenerate rhetoric of his age, especially a flowery
exuberance of style and fulsome extravagance in eulogy of dead martyrs and living men.
But the defects are overborne by the virtues: the fulness of Scripture knowledge, the intense
earnestness, the fruitfulness of illustration and application, the variation of topics, the
command of language, the elegance and rhythmic flow of his Greek style, the dramatic vivacity,
the quickness and ingenuity of his turns, and the magnetism of sympathy with his
hearers. He knew how to draw in the easiest manner spiritual nourishment and lessons of
practical wisdom from the Word of God, and to make it a divine voice of warning and
comfort to every hearer. He was a faithful preacher of truth and righteousness and fearlessly
told the whole duty of man. If he was too severe at times, he erred on virtue’s side. He
preached morals rather than dogmas, Christianity rather than theology, active, practical
Christianity that proves itself in holy living and dying. He was a martyr of the pulpit, for it
was chiefly his faithful preaching that caused his exile. The effect of his oratory was enhanced
by the magnetism of his personality, and is weakened to the reader of a translation or even
the Greek original. The living voice and glowing manner are far more powerful than the
written and printed letter.</p>
<p>Chrysostom attracted large audiences, and among them many who would rather have
gone to the theatre than hear any ordinary preacher. He held them spell-bound to the close.
Sometimes they manifested their admiration by noisy applause, and when he rebuked them
for it, they would applaud his rebuke. “You praise,” he would tell them, “what I have said,
and receive my exhortation with tumults of applause; but show your approbation by obedience;
that is the only praise I seek.”</p>
<p>The great mediæval poet assigns to Chrysostom a place in Paradise between Nathan
the prophet and Anselm the theologian, probably because, like Nathan, he rebuked the sins
of the court, and, like Anselm, he suffered exile for his conviction.38 The best French pulpit

orators—Bossuet, Massilon, Bourdaloue—have taken him for their model, even in his faults,
the flattery of living persons. Villemain praises him as the greatest orator who combined all
the attributes of eloquence.39 Hase calls his eloquence “Asiatic, flowery, full of spirit and of
the Holy Spirit, based on sound exegesis, and with steady application to life.”40 English
writers compare him to Jeremy Taylor. Gibbon (who confesses, however, to have read very
few of his Homilies) attributes to him “the happy art of engaging the passions in the service
of virtue, and of exposing the folly as well as the turpitude of vice, almost with the truth and
spirit of a dramatic representation.” Dean Milman describes him as an “unrivalled master
in that rapid and forcible application of incidental occurrences which gives such life and
reality to eloquence. He is at times, in the highest sense, dramatic in manner.” Stephens thus
characterizes his sermons:41</p>
<p>“A power of exposition which unfolded in lucid order, passage by passage, the meaning
of the book in hand; a rapid transition from clear exposition, or keen logical argument, to
fervid exhortation, or pathetic appeal, or indignant denunciation; the versatile ease with
which he could lay hold of any little incident of the moment, such as the lighting of the
lamps in the church, and use it to illustrate his discourse; the mixture of plain common
sense, simple boldness, and tender affection, with which he would strike home to the hearts
and consciences of his hearers—all these are not only general characteristics of the man,
but are usually to be found manifested more or less in the compass of each discourse. It is
this rare union of powers which constitutes his superiority to almost all other Christian
preachers with whom he might be, or has been, compared. Savonarola had all, and more
than all, his fire and vehemence, but untempered by his sober, calm good sense, and wanting
his rational method of interpretation. Chrysostom was eager and impetuous at times in
speech as well as in action, but never fanatical. Jeremy Taylor combines, like Chrysostom,
real earnestness of purpose with rhetorical forms of expression and florid imagery; but, on
the whole, his style is far more artificial, and is overlaid with a multifarious learning, from
which Chrysostom’s was entirely free. Wesley is almost his match in simple, straightforward,
practical exhortation, but does not rise into flights of eloquence like his. The great French
preachers, again, resemble him in his more ornate and declamatory vein, but they lack that
simpler common-sense style of address which equally distinguished him.”</p>

<pb n="38"/>
<head>INTRODUCTION TO THE TREATISE ON THE PRIESTHOOD.</head>
<p>The events recorded in this celebrated treatise on the Priesthood must have occurred
when St. John Chrysostom was about twenty-eight years of age. His father had died when
he was a young child; his mother was a devout Christian, but had not destined him for the
clerical vocation. The great ability which he showed in early youth seemed to mark him out
for distinction in one of the learned professions, and at the age of eighteen he began to attend
the school of Libanius, the most celebrated sophist of the day, who had won a great reputation
as a professor of philosophy and rhetoric, and as an eloquent opponent of Christianity, not
only in his native city, Antioch, but also in Athens, Nicomedia, and Constantinople. The
artificial character however of his writings indicates the decadence of literary power; he
could skillfully imitate the style of ancient writers but he could not inform himself with their
spirit; “his productions” says Gibbon [ch. xxiv], “are for the most part the vain and idle
composition of an orator who cultivated the science of words.”</p>
<p>In the school of Libanius Chrysostom no doubt studied the best classical Greek authors,
and although he retained little admiration for them in later life and probably read them but
rarely, his tenacious memory enabled him to the last to adorn his homilies with quotations
from Homer, Plato and the Tragedians. In the school of Libanius also he began to practice
his nascent power of eloquence, and a speech which he made in honor of the Emperors is
highly commended in an extant letter of his master. Thus the Pagan sophist helped to forge
the weapons which were destined to be turned against his own cause. When he was on his
death-bed being asked by his friends who was most worthy to succeed him, “it would have
been John,” he replied, “if the Christians had not stolen him from us.”</p>
<p>In due time Chrysostom began to practise as a lawyer; and as the profession of the law
was reckoned one of the surest avenues to political distinction for a man of talent, and the
speeches of Chrysostom excited great admiration, a brilliant and prosperous career seemed
to lie before him. But the soul of the young advocate had drunk draughts from a purer wellspring
than the school of Libanius could supply, and like many other Christians in that age
when society, even Christian society, was deeply tainted by Pagan sentiments and habits of
life, especially in a profligate city like Antioch, he recoiled from the contrast between the
morality of the world in which he lived, and the standard of holiness which was presented
in the Gospel. The chicanery and rapacity also prevalent in the profession which he had
adopted became especially repugnant to his conscience. And these feelings were strengthened
by the influence of his intimate friend Basil who had been a fellow pupil with him at the
school of Libanius.</p>
<p>The first book of the treatise on the Priesthood opens with a description of his friendship
with Basil; how they studied the same subjects together under the same teachers, and how
entirely harmonious they were in all their tastes, and inclinations [ci and ii.] Nevertheless

<pb n="39"/>
when Basil decided to follow what Chrysostom calls the “true philosophy,” by which he
means a life of religious seclusion and study, Chrysostom could not immediately make up
his mind to follow his example. The balance he says was no longer even between them; the
scale of Basil mounted heavenward, while his own was depressed by the weight of earthly
interests, and youthful ambitions. For a time he continued to practise in the law courts and
to frequent the theatre, and other places of amusement. But gradually the study of Scripture,
and saintly Bishop of Antioch so wrought upon his mind that he resolved to abandon his
secular calling. And in the first place after the usual course of probation he was baptized. It
may seem surprising that he had not been baptized in childhood; but a corrupt practice of
delaying baptism (which Chrysostom himself often reprobates in his Homilies) was prevalent
at that time. It was due in some persons to a notion that sin before Baptism was comparatively
venial, in others to a dread of binding themselves or their children to the purity of life which
was demanded by the Baptismal vows. In the case of Chrysostom it is possible, I think, that
the distracted condition of the church in Antioch may have operated as a reason, perhaps
the chief reason for the delay. At the date of his birth (about A.D. 345) and for sixteen years
afterwards the See was occupied by Arian Bishops of the most worldly time-serving type.
The good Catholic Bishop Meletius was appointed in 361 and it was probably some seven
or eight years later that Chrysostom was baptized by him, and ordained to the office of
Reader in the Church.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that Baptism, from whatever cause delayed, must have come
home to the recipient at last with all the more solemnity of meaning. It was often a decisive
turning point in the life, the beginning of a definite renunciation of the world, and dedication
of the whole man to God. To Chrysostom it evidently was this. For a time he became an
enthusiastic ascetic; and then settled down into that more tranquil, but intense glow of piety
which burned with unabated force to the close of his life. His baptism and the relinquishment
of his secular calling are probably alluded to in the following treatise c. 3. where he speaks
of “emerging a little from the flood of worldliness” in which he had been involved. His friend
Basil who received him with open arms does not seem to have joined any monastic community,
but merely to have been living in retirement and practising some of the usual
monastic austerities. The two friends now formed a plan for withdrawing together to some
quiet retreat, there to support one another in habits of study, meditation, and prayer. c. 4.
The execution of the project was delayed for a time by the passionate entreaties of Chrysostom’s
mother that he would not deprive her of his companionship and protection. c. 5. He
must have been a poor companion however, for we learn (vi. c. 12) that he rarely went outside
the house, maintained an almost perpetual silence, and was constantly absorbed in study
and prayer. He and Basil in fact formed with a few other friends a voluntary association of
youthful ascetics who lived under a strict rule. We might compare it with the association
or club formed by John Wesley and his brother at Oxford which first earned for them the

<pb n="40"/>
nickname of “Methodists.” Chrysostom and his friends placed the general regulation of
their studies and religious life under Diodorus and Carterius, the presidents of the two
principal monastic communities in the neighborhood of Antioch. Diodorus was a man of
learning and ability, opposed to those mystical and allegorical interpretations of Holy
Scripture which often disguised rather than elucidated the real meaning of the sacred text,
so that to his training probably we are largely indebted for that clear, sensible practical
method of exposition in which Chrysostom so remarkably excels nearly all the ancient
father of the Church.</p>
<p>Not long after the two friends had adopted this course of life, probably about the year
374, they were agitated by a report that they were likely to be advanced to the Episcopate
(c. 6.) By a custom which was then common in the Church they were liable if elected by the
clergy and people to be forcibly seized and ordained however unwilling they might be to
accept the dignity <del>see notes to chapters 6 and 7</del>. Basil entreated his friend that in this crisis
of their lives they might act as in former times in concert, and together accept, or evade if
possible the expected but unwelcome honor. Chrysostom affected assent to this proposal,
but secretly resolved to entrap Basil into the sacred office for which he considered him to
be as eminently fitted as he deemed himself to be unworthy. The Church should not on account
of his own feebleness be deprived if he could help it, of the able ministrations of such
a man as Basil. Accordingly when some agents of the electing body <del>as to the composition
of this body, see note 3, p. 21</del> were sent to seize the two young men, Chrysostom contrived
to hide himself. His language c. 6. seems to imply that he had some intimation of their
coming which he purposely withheld from Basil who consequently was caught. He made
at first a violent resistance, but the officials led him to suppose that Chrysostom had already
submitted, and under this delusion he acquiesced. When he discovered the trick which had
been played upon him he naturally reproached Chrysostom bitterly for his unkind treachery.
But the conscience of Chrysostom seems to have been quite at ease throughout the transaction.
He regarded it as a pious fraud and when he saw the mingled distress and anger of his
friend he could not refrain, he says, from laughing aloud for joy, and thanking God for the
success of his stratagem. The remainder of the 1st Book <del>chs. 8, 9</del> is occupied by Chrysostom’s
vindication of his conduct, the principle that deceit for a righteous end is often
salutary and justifiable being maintained with an ingenuity and skill which bespeaks a man
who had recently practised in the law-courts. His arguments indeed savor somewhat unpleasantly
of casuistry, and it must be confessed that in his conduct on this occasion there
is a tinge of something like oriental duplicity which is repugnant to our moral sense. On
the other hand it must be borne in mind that neither in the East nor in the West, for many
ages were “pious frauds” absolutely condemned by the conscience of Christendom; there
was always an inclination to judge each case on its own merits, and to condone if not to
approve those in which the balance of evidence was in favor of a righteous or holy purpose,

<pb n="41"/>
and a beneficial result. And it must also be owned, in justice to Chrysostom, that one of the
qualities most conspicuous in him throughout the whole of his subsequent career is fearless,
straightforward honesty alike in act and in speech; and this under the pressure very often
of strong temptation to dissemble and temporize.</p>
<p>The remaining books on the Priesthood treat of the pre-eminent dignity, and sanctity
of the priestly office and the peculiar difficulties and perils which beset it. They abound with
wise and weighty observations instructive for all times, but they are also interesting from
the light which they throw upon the condition of the Church and of society in the age when
Chrysostom lived. It is to be noted that he is speaking of the priesthood generally and that
it is not always easy to say in any given passage which of the first two orders in the ministry
he has in his mind. In many instances perhaps he was not thinking of one more than the
other. Where, as was very commonly the case, the jurisdiction of a bishop did not extend
very far beyond the limits of the city in which his See was placed, his functions would more
nearly resemble those which in our day are discharged by the incumbent of a large town
parish than those which are performed by the modern Bishop of a large diocese. He was the
chief pastor of the people, as well as the overseer of the clergy. Chrysostom’s friend Basil
has been confused by some with the great Basil, Bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, who was
fifteen years older than Chrysostom, by others with Basil Bishop of Seleucia, who was many
years younger. Nothing in fact is known about him beyond what is recorded in this treatise,
but he has been conjecturally identified with Basil Bishop of Raphnea in Syria, not far from
Antioch, who attended the Council of Constantinople in 381.</p>

<head>TREATISE ON THE PRIESTHOOD.</head>
<head>Book I.</head>
<p>1. I had many genuine and true friends, men who understood the laws of friendship,
and faithfully observed them; but out of this large number there was one who excelled all
the rest in his attachment to me, striving to outstrip them as much as they themselves outstripped
ordinary acquaintance. He was one of those who were constantly at my side; for
we were engaged in the same studies, and employed the same teachers.42 We had the same
eagerness and zeal about the studies at which we worked, and a passionate desire produced
by the same circumstances was equally strong in both of us. For not only when we were attending
school, but after we had left it, when it became necessary to consider what course
of life it would be best for us to adopt, we found ourselves to be of the same mind.</p>
<p>2. And in addition to these, there were other things also which preserved and maintained
this concord unbroken and secure. For as regarded the greatness of our fatherland neither
had one cause to vaunt himself over the other, nor was I burdened with riches, and he
pinched by poverty, but our means corresponded as closely as our tastes. Our families also
were of equal rank, and thus everything concurred with our disposition.</p>
<p>3. But when it became our duty to pursue the blessed life of monks, and the true philosophy,
43 our balance was no longer even, but his scale mounted high, while I, still entangled
in the lusts of this world, dragged mine down and kept it low, weighting it with those fancies
in which youths are apt to indulge. For the future our friendship indeed remained as firm
as it was before, but our intercourse was interrupted; for it was impossible for persons who
were not interested about the same things to spend much time together. But as soon as I
also began to emerge a little from the flood of worldliness, he received me with open arms;
yet not even thus could we maintain our former equality: for having got the start of me in
time, and having displayed great earnestness, he rose again above my level, and soared to a
great height.</p>
<p>4. Being a good man, however, and placing a high value on my friendship, he separated
himself from all the rest (of the brethren), and spent the whole of his time with me, which
he had desired to do before, but had been prevented as I was saying by my frivolity. For it

was impossible for a man who attended the law-courts, and was in a flutter of excitement
about the pleasures of the stage, to be often in the company of one who was nailed to his
books, and never set foot in the market place. Consequently when the hindrances were removed,
and he had brought me into the same condition of life as himself, he gave free vent
to the desire with which he had long been laboring. He could not bear leaving me even for
a moment, and he persistently urged that we should each of us abandon our own home and
share a common dwelling:—in fact he persuaded me, and the affair was taken in hand.</p>
<p>5. But the continual lamentations of my mother hindered me from granting him the
favor, or rather from receiving this boon at his hands. For when she perceived that I was
meditating this step, she took me into her own private chamber, and, sitting near me on the
bed where she had given birth to me, she shed torrents of tears, to which she added words
yet more pitiable than her weeping, in the following lamentable strain: My child, it was not
the will of Heaven that I should long enjoy the benefit of thy father’s virtue. For his death
soon followed the pangs which I endured at thy birth, leaving thee an orphan and me a
widow before my time to face all the horrors of widowhood, which only those who have
experienced them can fairly understand. For no words are adequate to describe the tempesttossed
condition of a young woman who, having but lately left her paternal home, and being
inexperienced in business, is suddenly racked by an overwhelming sorrow, and compelled
to support a load of care too great for her age and sex. For she has to correct the laziness of
servants, and to be on the watch for their rogueries, to repel the designs of relations, to bear
bravely the threats of those who collect the public taxes,44 and harshness in the imposition
of rates. And if the departed one should have left a child, even if it be a girl, great anxiety
will be caused to the mother, although free from much expense and fear: but a boy fills her
with ten thousand alarms and many anxieties every day, to say nothing of the great expense
which one is compelled to incur if she wishes to bring him up in a liberal way. None of these
things, however, induced me to enter into a second marriage, or introduce a second husband
into thy father’s house: but I held on as I was, in the midst of the storm and uproar, and did
not shun the iron furnace45 of widowhood. My foremost help indeed was the grace from
above; but it was no small consolation to me under those terrible trials to look continually
on thy face and to preserve in thee a living image of him who had gone, an image indeed
which was a fairly exact likeness.</p>
<p>On this account, even when thou wast an infant, and hadst not yet learned to speak, a
time when children are the greatest delight to their parents, thou didst afford me much

comfort. Nor indeed can you complain that, although I bore my widowhood bravely, I diminished
thy patrimony, which I know has been the fate of many who have had the misfortune
to be orphans. For, besides keeping the whole of it intact, I spared no expense which
was needful to give you an honorable position, spending for this purpose some of my own
fortune, and of my marriage dowry. Yet do not think that I say these things by way of reproaching
you; only in return for all these benefits I beg one favor: do not plunge me into
a second widowhood; nor revive the grief which is now laid to rest: wait for my death: it
may be in a little while I shall depart. The young indeed look forward to a distant old age;
but we who have grown old46 have nothing but death to wait for. When, then, you shall
have committed my body to the ground, and mingled my bones with thy father’s, embark
for a long voyage, and set sail on any sea thou wilt: then there will be no one to hinder thee:
but as long as my life lasts, be content to live with me. Do not, I pray you, oppose God in
vain, involving me without cause, who have done you no wrong, in these great calamities.
For if you have any reason to complain that I drag you into worldly cares, and force you to
attend to business, do not be restrained by any reverence for the laws of nature, for training
or custom, but fly from me as an enemy; but if, on the contrary, I do everything to provide
leisure for thy journey through this life, let this bond at least if nothing else keep thee by
me. For couldst thou say that ten thousand loved thee, yet no one will afford thee the enjoyment
of so much liberty, seeing there is no one who is equally anxious for thy welfare.</p>
<p>6. These words, and more, my mother spake to me, and I related them to that noble
youth. But he, so far from being disheartened by these speeches, was the more urgent in
making the same request as before. Now while we were thus situated, he continually entreating,
and I refusing my assent, we were both of us disturbed by a report suddenly reaching
us that we were about to be advanced to the dignity of the episcopate.47 As soon as I heard
this rumor I was seized with alarm and perplexity: with alarm lest I should be made captive
against my will, and perplexity, inquiring as I often did whence any such idea concerning
us could have entered the minds of these men; for looking to myself I found nothing worthy
of such an honor. But that noble youth having come to me privately, and having conferred
with me about these things as if with one who was ignorant of the rumor, begged that we
might in this instance also as formerly shape our action and our counsels the same way: for
he would readily follow me whichever course I might pursue, whether I attempted flight or
submitted to be captured. Perceiving then his eagerness, and considering that I should inflict

a loss upon the whole body of the Church if, owing to my own weakness, I were to deprive
the flock of Christ of a young man who was so good and so well qualified for the supervision
of large numbers, I abstained from disclosing to him the purpose which I had formed, although
I had never before allowed any of my plans to be concealed from him. I now told
him that it would be best to postpone our decision concerning this matter to another season,
as it was not immediately pressing, and by so doing persuaded him to dismiss it from his
thoughts, and at the same time encouraged him to hope that, if such a thing should ever
happen to us, I should be of the same mind with him. But after a short time, when one who
was to ordain us arrived, I kept myself concealed, but Basil, ignorant of this, was taken away
on another pretext, and made to take the yoke, hoping from the promises which I had made
to him that I should certainly follow, or rather supposing that he was following me. For
some of those who were present, seeing that he resented being seized, deceived him by exclaiming
how strange it was that one who was generally reputed to be the more hot tempered
(meaning me), had yielded very mildly to the judgment of the Fathers, whereas he, who was
reckoned a much wiser and milder kind of man, had shown himself hotheaded and conceited,
being unruly, restive, and contradictory.48 Having yielded to these remonstrances, and afterwards
having learned that I had escaped capture, he came to me in deep dejection, sat
down near me and tried to speak, but was hindered by distress of mind and inability to express
in words the violence to which he had been subjected. No sooner had he opened his
mouth than he was prevented from utterance by grief cutting short his words before they
could pass his lips. Seeing, then, his tearful and agitated condition, and knowing as I did
the cause, I laughed for joy, and, seizing his right hand, I forced a kiss on him, and praised
God that my plan had ended so successfully, as I had always prayed it might. But when he
saw that I was delighted and beaming with joy, and understood that he had been deceived
by me, he was yet more vexed and distressed.</p>
<p>7. And when he had a little recovered from this agitation of mind, he began: If you have
rejected the part allotted to you, and have no further regard for me (I know not indeed for
what cause), you ought at least to consider your own reputation; but as it is you have opened
the mouths of all, and the world is saying that you have declined this ministry through love
of vainglory, and there is no one who will deliver you from this accusation. As for me, I
cannot bear to go into the market place; there are so many who come up to me and reproach
me every day. For, when they see me anywhere in the city, all my intimate friends take me

aside, and cast the greater part of the blame upon me. Knowing his intention, they say, for
none of his affairs could be kept secret from you, you should not have concealed it, but
ought to have communicated it to us, and we should have been at no loss to devise some
plan for capturing him. But I am too much ashamed and abashed to tell them that I did not
know you had long been plotting this trick, lest they should say that our friendship was a
mere pretence. For even if it is so, as indeed it is—nor would you yourself deny it after what
you have done to me—yet it is well to hide our misfortune from the outside world, and
persons who entertain but a moderate opinion of us. I shrink from telling them the truth,
and how things really stand with us, and I am compelled in future to keep silence, and look
down on the ground, and turn away to avoid those whom I meet. For if I escape the condemnation
on the former charge, I am forced to undergo judgment for speaking falsehood. For
they will never believe me when I say that you ranged Basil amongst those who are not
permitted to know your secret affairs. Of this, however, I will not take much account, since
it has seemed agreeable to you, but how shall we endure the future disgrace? for some accuse
you of arrogance, others of vainglory: while those who are our more merciful accusers, lay
both these offences to our charge, and add that we have insulted those who did us honor,
although had they experienced even greater indignity it would only have served them right
for passing over so many and such distinguished men and advancing mere youths,49 who
were but yesterday immersed in the interests of this world, to such a dignity as they never
have dreamed of obtaining, in order that they may for a brief season knit the eyebrows, wear
dusky garments, and put on a grave face. Those who from the dawn of manhood to extreme
old age have diligently practised self-discipline, are now to be placed under the government
of youths who have not even heard the laws which should regulate their administration of
this office. I am perpetually assailed by persons who say such things and worse, and am at
a loss how to reply to them; but I pray you tell me: for I do not suppose that you took to
flight and incurred such hatred from such distinguished men without cause or consideration,
but that your decision was made with reasoning and circumspection: whence also I conjecture
that you have some argument ready for your defence. Tell me, then, whether there is any
fair excuse which I can make to those who accuse us.</p>
<p>For I do not demand any account for the wrongs which I have sustained at your hands,
nor for the deceit or treachery you have practised, nor for the advantage which you have
derived from me in the past. For I placed my very life, so to say, in your hands, yet you have
treated me with as much guile as if it had been your business to guard yourself against an

enemy. Yet if you knew this decision of ours to be profitable, you ought not to have avoided
the gain: if on the contrary injurious, you should have saved me also from the loss, as you
always said that you esteemed me before every one else. But you have done everything to
make me fall into the snare: and you had no need of guile and hypocrisy in dealing with one
who was wont to display the utmost sincerity and candor in speech and action towards thee.
Nevertheless, as I said, I do not now accuse you of any of these things, or reproach you for
the lonely position in which you have placed me by breaking off those conferences from
which we often derived no small pleasure and profit; but all these things I pass by, and bear
in silence and meekness, not that thou hast acted meekly in transgressing against me, but
because from the day that I cherished thy friendship I laid it down as a rule for myself, that
whatever sorrow you might cause me I would never force you to the necessity of an apology.
For you know yourself that you have inflicted no small loss on me if at least you remember
what we were always saying ourselves, and the outside world also said concerning us, that
it was a great gain for us to be of one mind and be guarded by each other’s friendship. Every
one said, indeed, that our concord would bring no small advantage to many besides ourselves;
I never perceived, however, so far as I am concerned, how it could be of advantage to others:
but I did say that we should at least derive this benefit from it: that those who wished to
contend with us would find us difficult to master. And I never ceased reminding you of
these things: saying the age is a cruel one, and designing men are many, genuine love is no
more, and the deadly pest of envy has crept into its place: we walk in the midst of snares,
and on the edge of battlements;50 those who are ready to rejoice in our misfortunes, if any
should befall us, are many and beset us from many quarters: whereas there is no one to
condole with us, or at least the number of such may be easily counted. Beware that we do
not by separation incur much ridicule, and damage worse than ridicule. Brother aided by
brother is like a strong city, and well fortified kingdom.51 Do not dissolve this genuine intimacy,
nor break down the fortress. Such things and more I was continually saying, not
indeed that I ever suspected anything of this kind, but supposing you to be entirely sound
in your relation towards me, I did it as a superfluous precaution, wishing to preserve in
health one who was already sound; but unwittingly, as it seems, I was administering medicines
to a sick man: and even so I have not been fortunate enough to do any good, and have gained
nothing by my excess of forethought. For having totally cast away all these considerations,
without giving them a thought, you have turned me adrift like an unballasted vessel on an
untried ocean, taking no heed of those fierce billows which I must encounter. For if it should
ever be my lot to undergo calumny, or mockery, or any other kind of insult or menace (and

such things must frequently occur), to whom shall I fly for refuge: to whom shall I impart
my distress, who will be willing to succour me and drive back my assailants and put a stop
to their assaults? who will solace me and prepare me to bear the coarse ribaldry which may
yet be in store for me. There is no one since you stand aloof from this terrible strife, and
cannot even hear my cry. Seest thou then what mischief thou hast wrought? now that thou
hast dealt the blow, dost thou perceive what a deadly wound thou hast inflicted? But let all
this pass: for it is impossible to undo the past, or to find a path through pathless difficulties.
What shall I say to the outside world? what defence shall I make to their accusations.</p>
<p>8. Chrysostom: Be of good cheer, I replied, for I am not only ready to answer for myself
in these matters, but I will also endeavor as well as I am able to render an account of those
for which you have not held me answerable. Indeed, if you wish it, I will make them the
starting-point of my defence. For it would be a strange piece of stupidity on my part if,
thinking only of praise from the outside public, and doing my best to silence their accusations,
I were unable to convince my dearest of all friends that I am not wronging him, and were
to treat him with indifference greater than the zeal which he has displayed on my behalf,
treating me with such forbearance as even to refrain from accusing me of the wrongs which
he says he has suffered from me, and putting his own interests out of the question in consideration
for mine.</p>
<p>What is the wrong that I have done thee, since I have determined to embark from this
point upon the sea of apology? Is it that I misled you and concealed my purpose? Yet I did
it for the benefit of thyself who wast deceived, and of those to whom I surrendered you by
means of this deceit. For if the evil of deception is absolute, and it is never right to make use
of it, I am prepared to pay any penalty you please: or rather, as you will never endure to inflict
punishment upon me, I shall subject myself to the same condemnation which is pronounced
by judges on evil-doers when their accusers have convicted them. But if the thing is not always
harmful, but becomes good or bad according to the intention of those who practise it, you
must desist from complaining of deceit, and prove that it has been devised against you for
a bad purpose; and as long as this proof is wanting it would only be fair for those who wish
to conduct themselves prudently, not only to abstain from reproaches and accusation, but
even to give a friendly reception to the deceiver. For a well-timed deception, undertaken
with an upright intention, has such advantages, that many persons have often had to undergo
punishment for abstaining from fraud. And if you investigate the history of generals who
have enjoyed the highest reputation from the earliest ages, you will find that most of their
triumphs were achieved by stratagem, and that such are more highly commended than those
who conquer in open fight. For the latter conduct their campaigns with greater expenditure
of money and men, so that they gain nothing by the victory, but suffer just as much distress
as those who have been defeated, both in the sacrifice of troops and the exhaustion of funds.
But, besides this, they are not even permitted to enjoy all the glory which pertains to the

<pb n="49"/>
victory; for no small part of it is reaped by those who have fallen, because in spirit they were
victorious, their defeat was only a bodily one: so that had it been possible for them not to
fall when they were wounded, and death had not come and put the finishing stroke to their
labors, there would have been no end of their prowess. But one who has been able to gain
the victory by stratagem involves the enemy in ridicule as well as disaster. Again, in the
other case both sides equally carry off the honors bestowed upon valor, whereas in this case
they do not equally obtain those which are bestowed on wisdom, but the prize falls entirely
to the victors, and, another point no less important is that they preserve the joy of the victory
for the state unalloyed; for abundance of resources and multitudes of men are not like
mental powers: the former indeed if continually used in war necessarily become exhausted,
and fail those who possess them, whereas it is the nature of wisdom to increase the more it
is exercised. And not in war only, but also in peace the need of deceit may be found, not
merely in reference to the affairs of the state, but also in private life, in the dealings of husband
with wife and wife with husband, son with father, friend with friend, and also children with
a parent. For the daughter of Saul would not have been able to rescue her husband out of
Saul’s hands52 except by deceiving her father. And her brother, wishing to save him whom
she had rescued when he was again in danger, made use of the same weapon as the wife.53</p>
<p>Basil: But none of these cases apply to me: for I am not an enemy, nor one of those who
are striving to injure thee, but quite the contrary. For I entrusted all my interests to your
judgment, and always followed it whenever you bid me.</p>
<p>Chrysostom: But, my admirable and excellent Sir, this is the very reason why I took the
precaution of saying that it was a good thing to employ this kind of deceit, not only in war,
and in dealing with enemies, but also in peace, and in dealing with our dearest friends. For
as a proof that it is beneficial not only to the deceivers, but also to those who are deceived;
if you go to any of the physicians and ask them how they relieve their patients from disease,
they will tell you that they do not depend upon their professional skill alone, but sometimes
conduct the sick to health by availing themselves of deceit, and blending the assistance which
they derive from it with their art. For when the waywardness of the patient and the obstinacy
of the complaint baffle the counsels of the physicians, it is then necessary to put on the mask
of deceit in order that, as on the stage, they may be able to hide what really takes place. But,
if you please, I will relate to you one instance of stratagem out of many which I have heard
of being contrived by the sons of the healing art.54 A man was once suddenly attacked by a
fever of great severity; the burning heat increased, and the patient rejected the remedies
which could have reduced it and craved for a draught of pure wine, passionately entreating

all who approached to give it him and enable him to satiate this deadly craving—I say deadly,
for if any one had gratified this request he would not only have exasperated the fever, but
also have driven the unhappy man frantic. Thereupon, professional skill being baffled, and
at the end of its resources and utterly thrown away, stratagem stepped in and displayed its
power in the way which I will now relate. For the physician took an earthen cup brought
straight out of the furnace, and having steeped it in wine, then drew it out empty, filled it
with water, and, having ordered the chamber where the sick man lay to be darkened with
curtains that the light might not reveal the trick, he gave it him to drink, pretending that it
was filled with undiluted wine. And the man, before he had taken it in his hands, being deceived
by the smell, did not wait to examine what was given him, but convinced by the odor,
and deceived by the darkness, eagerly gulped down the draught, and being satiated with it
immediately shook off the feeling of suffocation and escaped the imminent peril.55 Do you
see the advantage of deceit? And if any one were to reckon up all the tricks of physicians
the list would run on to an indefinite length. And not only those who heal the body but
those also who attend to the diseases of the soul may be found continually making use of
this remedy. Thus the blessed Paul attracted those multitudes of Jews:56 with this purpose
he circumcised Timothy,57 although he warned the Galatians in his letter58 that Christ
would not profit those who were circumcised. For this cause he submitted to the law, although
he reckoned the righteousness which came from the law but loss after receiving the faith in
Christ.59 For great is the value of deceit, provided it be not introduced with a mischievous
intention. In fact action of this kind ought not to be called deceit, but rather a kind of good
management, cleverness and skill, capable of finding out ways where resources fail, and
making up for the defects of the mind. For I would not call Phinees a murderer, although
he slew two human beings with one stroke:60 nor yet Elias after the slaughter of the 100
soldiers, and the captain,61 and the torrents of blood which he caused to be shed by the destruction
of those who sacrificed to devils.62 For if we were to concede this, and to examine
the bare deeds in themselves apart from the intention of the doers, one might if he pleased

judge Abraham guilty of child-murder63 and accuse his grandson64 and descendant65 of

of these things, since even God commended them for the same. For that man would fairly
deserve to be called a deceiver who made an unrighteous use of the practice, not one who
did so with a salutary purpose. And often it is necessary to deceive, and to do the greatest
benefits by means of this device, whereas he who has gone by a straight course has done
great mischief to the person whom he has not deceived.</p>

<p>1. That it is possible then to make use of deceit for a good purpose, or rather that in
such a case it ought not to be called deceit, but a kind of good management worthy of all
admiration, might be proved at greater length; but since what has already been said suffices
for demonstration, it would be irksome and tedious to lengthen out my discourse upon the
subject. And now it will remain for you to prove whether I have not employed this art to
your advantage.</p>
<p>Basil: And what kind of advantage have I derived from this piece of good management,
or wise policy, or whatever you may please to call it, so as to persuade me that I have not
been deceived by you?</p>
<p>Chrysostom: What advantage, pray, could be greater than to be seen doing those things
which Christ with his own lips declared to be proofs of love to Himself?66 For addressing
the leader of the apostles He said, “Peter, lovest thou me?” and when he confessed that he
did, the Lord added, “if thou lovest me tend my sheep.” The Master asked the disciple if He
was loved by him, not in order to get information (how should He who penetrates the hearts
of all men?), but in order to teach us how great an interest He takes in the superintendence
of these sheep. This being plain, it will likewise be manifest that a great and unspeakable
reward will be reserved for him whose labors are concerned with these sheep, upon which
Christ places such a high value. For when we see any one bestowing care upon members of
our household, or upon our flocks, we count his zeal for them as a sign of love towards
ourselves: yet all these things are to be bought for money:—with how great a gift then will
He requite those who tend the flock which He purchased, not with money, nor anything of
that kind, but by His own death, giving his own blood as the price of the herd. Wherefore
when the disciple said, “Thou knowest Lord that I love Thee,” and invoked the beloved one
Himself as a witness of his love, the Saviour did not stop there, but added that which was
the token of love. For He did not at that time wish to show how much Peter loved Him, but
how much He Himself loved His own Church, and he desired to teach Peter and all of us
that we also should bestow much zeal upon the same. For why did God not spare His onlybegotten
Son, but delivered Him up, although the only one He had?67 It was that He might
reconcile to Himself those who were disposed towards Him as enemies, and make them His
peculiar people. For what purpose did He shed His blood? It was that He might win these
sheep which He entrusted to Peter and his successors. Naturally then did Christ say, “Who
then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord shall make ruler over His household.”68
<note type="footnote">66 John xxi. 15–17.</note>
<note type="footnote">67 Rom. viii. 32; John iii. 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">68 Matt. xxiv. 45. Some mss. of Chrysostom have the future καταστήσει, shall make ruler, but all mss. of the
New Testament have the aorist κατ™στησε, made ruler.</note>

<pb n="53"/>
Again, the words are those of one who is in doubt, yet the speaker did not utter them in
doubt, but just as He asked Peter whether he loved Him, not from any need to learn the affection
of the disciple, but from a desire to show the exceeding depth of his own love: so
now also when He says, “Who then is the faithful and wise servant?” he speaks not as being
ignorant who is faithful and wise, but as desiring to set forth the rarity of such a character,
and the greatness of this office. Observe at any rate how great the reward is—“He will appoint
him,” he says, “ruler over all his goods.”69</p>
<p>2. Will you, then, still contend that you were not rightly deceived, when you are about
to superintend the things which belong to God, and are doing that which when Peter did
the Lord said he should be able to surpass the rest of the apostles, for His words were, “Peter,
lovest thou me more than these?”70 Yet He might have said to him, “If thou lovest me
practise fasting, sleeping on the ground, and prolonged vigils, defend the wronged, be as a
father to orphans, and supply the place of a husband to their mother.” But as a matter of
fact, setting aside all these things, what does He say? “Tend my sheep.” For those things
which I have already mentioned might easily be performed by many even of those who are
under authority, women as well as men; but when one is required to preside over the Church,
and to be entrusted with the care of so many souls, the whole female sex must retire before
the magnitude of the task, and the majority of men also; and we must bring forward those
who to a large extent surpass all others, and soar as much above them in excellence of spirit
as Saul overtopped the whole Hebrew nation in bodily stature: or rather far more.71 For in
this case let me not take the height of shoulders as the standard of inquiry; but let the distinction
between the pastor and his charge be as great as that between rational man and irrational
creatures, not to say even greater, inasmuch as the risk is concerned with things of
far greater importance. He indeed who has lost sheep, either through the ravages of wolves,
or the attacks of robbers, or through murrain, or any other disaster befalling them, might
perhaps obtain some indulgence from the owner of the flock; and even if the latter should
demand satisfaction the penalty would be only a matter of money: but he who has human
beings entrusted to him, the rational flock of Christ, incurs a penalty in the first place for
the loss of the sheep, which goes beyond material things and touches his own life: and in
the second place he has to carry on a far greater and more difficult contest. For he has not
to contend with wolves, nor to dread robbers, nor to consider how he may avert pestilence
from the flock. With whom then has he to fight? with whom has he to wrestle? Listen to the
words of St. Paul. “We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against
powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high

places.”72 Do you see the terrible multitude of enemies, and their fierce squadrons, not steel
clad, but endued with a nature which is of itself an equivalent for a complete suit of armor.
Would you see yet another host, stern and cruel, beleaguering this flock? This also you shall
behold from the same post of observation. For he who has discoursed to us concerning the
others, points out these enemies also to us, speaking in a certain place on this wise: “The
works of the flesh are manifest, which are these, fornication, adultery, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, strife,73 backbitings,
whisperings, swellings, tumults,”74 and many more besides; for he did not make a complete
list, but left us to understand the rest from these. Moreover, in the case of the shepherd of
irrational creatures, those who wish to destroy the flock, when they see the guardian take
to flight, cease making war upon him, and are contented with the seizure of the cattle: but
in this case, even should they capture the whole flock, they do not leave the shepherd unmolested,
but attack him all the more, and wax bolder, ceasing not until they have either overthrown
him, or have themselves been vanquished. Again, the afflictions of sheep are manifest,
whether it be famine, or pestilence, or wounds, or whatsoever else it may be which distresses
them, and this might help not a little towards the relief of those who are oppressed in these
ways. And there is yet another fact greater than this which facilitates release from this kind
of infirmity. And what is that? The shepherds with great authority compel the sheep to receive
the remedy when they do not willingly submit to it. For it is easy to bind them when cautery
or cutting is required, and to keep them inside the fold for a long time, whenever it is expedient,
and to bring them one kind of food instead of another, and to cut them off from their
supplies of water, and all other things which the shepherds may decide to be conducive to
their health they perform with great ease.</p>
<p>3. But in the case of human infirmities, it is not easy in the first place for a man to discern
them, for no man “knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him.”75
How then can any one apply the remedy for the disease of which he does not know the
character, often indeed being unable to understand it even should he happen to sicken with
it himself? And even when it becomes manifest, it causes him yet more trouble: for it is not
possible to doctor all men with the same authority with which the shepherd treats his sheep.
For in this case also it is necessary to bind and to restrain from food, and to use cautery or
the knife: but the reception of the treatment depends on the will of the patient, not of him
who applies the remedy. For this also was perceived by that wonderful man (St. Paul) when
he said to the Corinthians—“Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers
<note type="footnote">72 Ephes. vi. 12.</note>

of your joy.”76 For Christians above all men are not permitted forcibly to correct the failings
of those who sin. Secular judges indeed, when they have captured malefactors under the
law, show their authority to be great, and prevent them even against their will from following
their own devices: but in our case the wrong-doer must be made better, not by force, but
by persuasion. For neither has authority of this kind for the restraint of sinners been given
us by law, nor, if it had been given, should we have any field for the exercise of our power,
inasmuch as God rewards those who abstain from evil by their own choice, not of necessity.
Consequently much skill is required that our patients may be induced to submit willingly
to the treatment prescribed by the physicians, and not only this, but that they may be
grateful also for the cure. For if any one when he is bound becomes restive (which it is in
his power to be), he makes the mischief worse; and if he should pay no heed to the words
which cut like steel, he inflicts another wound by means of this contempt, and the intention
to heal only becomes the occasion of a worse disorder. For it is not possible for any one to
cure a man by compulsion against his will.</p>
<p>4. What then is one to do? For if you deal too gently with him who needs a severe application
of the knife, and do not strike deep into one who requires such treatment, you remove
one part of the sore but leave the other: and if on the other hand you make the requisite
incision unsparingly, the patient, driven to desperation by his sufferings, will often fling
everything away at once, both the remedy and the bandage, and throw himself down headlong,
“breaking the yoke and bursting the band.”77 I could tell of many who have run into
extreme evils because the due penalty of their sins was exacted. For we ought not, in applying
punishment, merely to proportion it to the scale of the offence, but rather to keep in view
the disposition of the sinner, lest whilst wishing to mend what is torn, you make the rent
worse, and in your zealous endeavors to restore what is fallen, you make the ruin greater.
For weak and careless characters, addicted for the most part to the pleasures of the world,
and having occasion to be proud on account of birth and position, may yet, if gently and
gradually brought to repent of their errors, be delivered, partially at least, if not perfectly,
from the evils by which they are possessed: but if any one were to inflict the discipline all at
once, he would deprive them of this slight chance of amendment. For when once the soul
has been forced to put off shame it lapses into a callous condition, and neither yields to
kindly words nor bends to threats, nor is susceptible of gratitude, but becomes far worse
than that city which the prophet reproached, saying, “thou hadst the face of a harlot, refusing
to be ashamed before all men.”78 Therefore the pastor has need of much discretion, and of
a myriad eyes to observe on every side the habit of the soul. For as many are uplifted to

<pb n="56"/>
pride, and then sink into despair of their salvation, from inability to endure severe remedies,
so are there some, who from paying no penalty equivalent to their sins, fall into negligence,
and become far worse, and are impelled to greater sins. It behoves the priest therefore to
leave none of these things unexamined, but, after a thorough inquiry into all of them, to
apply such remedies as he has appositely to each case, lest his zeal prove to be in vain. And
not in this matter only, but also in the work of knitting together the severed members of
the Church, one can see that he has much to do. For the pastor of sheep has his flock following
him, wherever he may lead them: and if any should stray out of the straight path, and,
deserting the good pasture, feed in unproductive or rugged places, a loud shout suffices to
collect them and bring back to the fold those who have been parted from it: but if a human
being wanders away from the right faith, great exertion, perseverance and patience are required;
for he cannot be dragged back by force, nor constrained by fear, but must be led
back by persuasion to the truth from which he originally swerved. The pastor therefore
ought to be of a noble spirit, so as not to despond, or to despair of the salvation of wanderers
from the fold, but continually to reason with himself and say, “Peradventure God will give
them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, and that they may recover themselves
out of the snare of the devil.”79 Therefore the Lord, when addressing His disciples, said,
“Who then is the faithful and wise servant?”80 For he indeed who disciplines himself compasses
only his own advantage, but the benefit of the pastoral function extends to the whole
people. And one who dispenses money to the needy, or otherwise succors the oppressed,
benefits his neighbors to some extent, but so much less than the priest in proportion as the
body is inferior to the soul. Rightly therefore did the Lord say that zeal for the flock was a
token of love for Himself.</p>
<p>Basil: But thou thyself—dost thou not love Christ?</p>
<p>Chrysostom: Yea, I love Him, and shall never cease loving Him; but I fear lest I should
provoke Him whom I love.</p>
<p>Basil: But what riddle can there be more obscure than this—Christ has commanded
him who loves Him to tend His sheep, and yet you say that you decline to tend them because
you love Him who gave this command?</p>
<p>Chrysostom: My saying is no riddle, but very intelligible and simple, for if I were well
qualified to administer this office, as Christ desired it, and then shunned it, my remark
might be open to doubt, but since the infirmity of my spirit renders me useless for this
ministry, why does my saying deserve to be called in question? For I fear lest if I took the
flock in hand when it was in good condition and well nourished, and then wasted it through
<note type="footnote">79 2 Tim. ii. 25.</note>
<note type="footnote">80 Matt. xxiv. 45.</note>

<pb n="57"/>
my unskilfulness, I should provoke against myself the God who so loved the flock as to give
Himself up for their salvation and ransom.</p>
<p>Basil: You speak in jest: for if you were in earnest I know not how you would have proved
me to be justly grieved otherwise than by means of these very words whereby you have endeavored
to dispel my dejection. I knew indeed before that you had deceived and betrayed
me, but much more now, when you have undertaken to clear yourself of my accusations,
do I plainly perceive and understand the extent of the evils into which you have led me. For
if you withdrew yourself from this ministry because you were conscious that your spirit was
not equal to the burden of the task, I ought to have been rescued from it before you, even
if I had chanced to have a great desire for it, to say nothing of having confided to you the
entire decision of these matters: but as it is, you have looked solely to your own interest and
neglected mine. Would indeed you had entirely neglected them; then I should have been
well content: but you plotted to facilitate my capture by those who wished to seize me. For
you cannot take shelter in the argument that public opinion deceived you and induced you
to imagine great and wonderful things concerning me. For I was none of your wonderful
and distinguished men, nor, had this been the case, ought you to have preferred public
opinion to truth. For if I had never permitted you to enjoy my society, you might have
seemed to have a reasonable pretext for being guided in your vote by public report; but if
there is no one who has such thorough knowledge of my affairs, if you are acquainted with
my character better than my parents and those who brought me up, what argument can you
employ which will be convincing enough to persuade your hearers that you did not purposely
thrust me into this danger: say, what answer shall I make to your accusers?</p>
<p>Chrysostom: Nay! I will not proceed to those questions until I have resolved such as
concern yourself alone, if you were to ask me ten thousand times to dispose of these charges.
You said indeed that ignorance would bring me forgiveness, and that I should have been
free from all accusation if I had brought you into your present position not knowing anything
about you, but that as I did not betray you in ignorance, but was intimately acquainted with
your affairs, I was deprived of all reasonable pretext and excuse. But I say precisely the reverse:
for in such matters there is need of careful scrutiny, and he who is going to present any one
as qualified for the priesthood ought not to be content with public report only, but should
also himself, above all and before all, investigate the man’s character. For when the blessed
Paul says, “He must also have a good report of them which are without,”81 he does not dispense
with an exact and rigorous inquiry, nor does he assign to such testimony precedence
over the scrutiny required in such cases. For after much previous discourse, he mentioned
this additional testimony, proving that one must not be contented with it alone for elections
of this kind, but take it into consideration along with the rest. For public report often speaks
<note type="footnote">81 1 Tim. iii. 7.</note>

<pb n="58"/>
false; but when careful investigation precedes, no further danger need be apprehended from
it. On this account, after the other kinds of evidence he places that which comes from those
who are without. For he did not simply say, “he must have a good report,” but added the
words, “from them which are without,” wishing to show that before the report of those
without he must be carefully examined. Inasmuch, then, as I myself knew your affairs better
than your parents, as you also yourself acknowledged, I might deserve to be released from
all blame.</p>
<p>Basil: Nay this is the very reason why you could not escape, if any one chose to indite
you. Do you not remember hearing from me, and often learning from my actual conduct,
the feebleness of my character? Were you not perpetually taunting me for my pusillanimity,
because I was so easily dejected by ordinary cares?</p>
<p>5. Chrysostom: I do indeed remember often hearing such things said by you; I would
not deny it. But if I ever taunted you, I did it in sport and not in serious truth. However, I
do not now dispute about these matters, and I claim the same degree of forbearance from
you while I wish to make mention of some of the good qualities which you possess. For if
you attempt to convict me of saying what is untrue, I shall not spare you, but shall prove
that you say these things rather by way of self-depreciation than with a view to truth, and I
will employ no evidence but your own words and deeds to demonstrate the truth of my assertion.
And now the first question I wish to ask of you is this: do you know how great the
power of love is? For omitting all the miracles which were to be wrought by the apostles,
Christ said, “Hereby shall men know that ye are my disciples if ye love one another,”82 and
Paul said that it was the fulfilling of the law,83 and that in default of it no spiritual gift had
any profit. Well, this choice good, the distinguishing mark of Christ’s disciples, the gift
which is higher than all other gifts, I perceived to be deeply implanted in your soul, and
teeming with much fruit.</p>
<p>Basil: I acknowledge indeed that the matter is one of deep concern to me, and that I
endeavor most earnestly to keep this commandment, but that I have not even half succeeded
in so doing, even you yourself would bear me witness if you would leave off talking out of
partiality, and simply respect the truth.</p>
<p>6. Chrysostom: Well, then, I shall betake myself to my evidences, and shall now do what
I threatened, proving that you wish to disparage yourself rather than to speak the truth. But
I will mention a fact which has only just occurred, that no one may suspect me of attempting
to obscure the truth by the great lapse of time in relating events long past, as oblivion would
then prevent any objection being made to the things which I might say with a view to grati-

fication.84 For when one of our intimate friends, having been falsely accused of insult and
folly, was in extreme peril, you then flung yourself into the midst of the danger, although
you were not summoned by any one, or appealed to by the person who was about to be involved
in danger. Such was the fact: but that I may convict you out of your own mouth, I
will remind you of the words you uttered: for when some did not approve of this zeal, while
others commended and admired it, “How can I help myself?” you said to those who accused
you, “for I do not know how otherwise to love than by giving up my life when it is necessary
to save any of my friends who is in danger:” thus repeating, in different words, indeed, but
with the same meaning, what Christ said to his disciples when he laid down the definition
of perfect love. “Greater love,” He said, “hath no man than this that a man lay down his life
for his friends.” If then it is impossible to find greater love than this, you have attained its
limit, and both by your deeds and words have crowned the summit. This is why I betrayed
you, this is why I contrived that plot. Do I now convince you that it was not from any malicious
intent, nor from any desire to thrust you into danger, but from a persuasion of your
future usefulness that I dragged you into this course?</p>
<p>Basil: Do you then suppose that love is sufficient for the correction of one’s fellowmen?</p>
<p>Chrysostom: Certainly it would contribute in a great measure to this end. But if you
wish me to produce evidence of your practical wisdom also, I will proceed to do so, and will
prove that your understanding exceeds your lovingkindness.</p>
<p>At these remarks he blushed scarlet and said, “Let my character be now dismissed: for
it was not about this that I originally demanded an explanation; but if you have any just
answer to make to those who are without, I would gladly hear what you have to say.
Wherefore, abandoning this vain contest, tell me what defence I shall make, both to those
who have honored you and to those who are distressed on their account, considering them
to be insulted.</p>
<p>7. Chrysostom: This is just the point to which I am finally hastening, for as my explanation
to you has been completed I shall easily turn to this part of my defence. What then is
the accusation made by these persons, and what are their charges? They say that they have
been insulted and grievously wronged by me because I have not accepted the honor which
they wished to confer upon me. Now in the first place I say that no account should be taken
of the insult shown to men, seeing that by paying honor to them I should be compelled to
offend God. And I should say to those who are displeased that it is not safe to take offence
at these things, but does them much harm. For I think that those who stay themselves on

which has recently occurred as an evidence of Basil’s character, because if he referred to events which were no

of partiality.</note>

<pb n="60"/>
God and look to Him alone, ought to be so religiously disposed as not to account such a
thing an insult, even if they happened to be a thousand times dishonored. But that I have
not gone so far as even to think of daring anything of this kind is manifest from what I am
about to say. For if indeed I had been induced by arrogance and vainglory, as you have often
said some slanderously affirm, to assent to my accusers, I should have been one of the most
iniquitous of mankind, having treated great and excellent men, my benefactors moreover,
with contempt. For if men ought to be punished for wronging those who have never wronged
them, how ought we to honor those who have spontaneously preferred to honor us? For no
one could possibly say that they were requiting me for any benefits small or great which
they had received at my hands. How great a punishment then would one deserve if one requited
them in the contrary manner. But if such a thing never entered my mind, and I declined
the heavy burden with quite a different intention, why do they refuse to pardon me
(even if they do not consent to approve), but accuse me of having selfishly spared my own
soul? For so far from having insulted the men in question I should say that I had even
honored them by my refusal.</p>
<p>And do not be surprised at the paradoxical nature of my remark, for I shall supply a
speedy solution of it.</p>
<p>8. For had I accepted the office, I do not say all men, but those who take pleasure in
speaking evil, might have suspected and said many things concerning myself who had been
elected and concerning them, the electors: for instance, that they regarded wealth, and admired
splendor of rank, or had been induced by flattery to promote me to this honor: indeed
I cannot say whether some one might not have suspected that they were bribed by money.
Moreover, they would have said, “Christ called fishermen, tentmakers, and publicans to
this dignity, whereas these men reject those who support themselves by daily labor: but if
there be any one who devotes himself to secular learning, and is brought up in idleness, him
they receive and admire. For why, pray, have they passed by men who have undergone innumerable
toils in the service of the Church, and suddenly dragged into this dignity one
who has never experienced any labors of this kind, but has spent all his youth in the vain
study of secular learning.” These things and more they might have said had I accepted the
office: but not so now. For every pretext for maligning is now cut away from them, and they
can neither accuse me of flattery, nor the others of receiving bribes, unless some choose to
act like mere madmen. For how could one who used flattery and expended money in order
to obtain the dignity, have abandoned it to others when he might have obtained it? For this
would be just as if a man who had bestowed much labor upon the ground in order that the
corn field might be laden with abundant produce, and the presses overflow with wine, after
innumerable toils and great expenditure of money were to surrender the fruits to others
just when it was time to reap his corn and gather in his vintage. Do you see that although
what was said might be far from the truth, nevertheless those who wished to calumniate the

<pb n="61"/>
electors would then have had a pretext for alleging that the choice was made without fair
judgment and consideration. But as it is I have prevented them from being open mouthed,
or even uttering a single word on the subject. Such then and more would have been their
remarks at the outset. But after undertaking the ministry I should not have been able day
by day to defend myself against accusers, even if I had done everything faultlessly, to say
nothing of the many mistakes which I must have made owing to my youth and inexperience.
But now I have saved the electors from this kind of accusation also, whereas in the other
case I should have involved them in innumerable reproaches. For what would not the world
have said? “They have committed affairs of such vast interest and importance to thoughtless
youths, they have defiled the flock of God, and Christian affairs have become a jest and a
laughing-stock.” But now “all iniquity shall stop her mouth.”85 For although they may say
these things on your account, you will speedily teach them by your acts that understanding
is not to be estimated by age, and the grey head is not to be the test of an elder—that the
young man ought not to be absolutely excluded from the ministry, but only the novice: and
the difference between the two is great.</p>

<p>1. Chrysostom: As regards the insult to those who have done me honor, what I have
already said might be sufficient to prove that in avoiding this office I had no desire to put
them to shame; but I will now endeavor to make it evident, to the best of my ability, that I
was not puffed up by arrogance of any kind. For if the choice of a generalship or a kingdom
had been submitted to me, and I had then formed this resolution, any one might naturally
have suspected me of this fault, or rather I should have been found guilty by all men, not of
arrogance, but of senseless folly. But when the priesthood is offered to me, which exceeds
a kingdom as much as the spirit differs from the flesh, will any one dare to accuse me of
disdain? And is it not preposterous to charge with folly those who reject small things, but
when any do this in matters of pre-eminent importance, to exempt such persons from accusations
of mental derangement, and yet subject them to the charge of pride? It is just as
if one were to accuse, not of pride, but of insanity, a man who looked with contempt on a
herd of oxen and refused to be a herdsman, and yet were to say that a man who declined
the empire of the world, and the command of all the armies of the earth, was not mad, but
inflated with pride. But this assuredly is not the case; and they who say such things do not
injure me more than they injure themselves. For merely to imagine it possible for human
nature to despise this dignity is an evidence against those who bring this charge of the estimate
which they have formed of the office. For if they did not consider it to be an ordinary
thing of no great account, such a suspicion as this would never have entered their heads.
For why is it that no one has ever dared to entertain such a suspicion with reference to the
dignity of the angels, and to say that arrogance is the reason why human nature would not
aspire to the rank of the angelic nature? It is because we imagine great things concerning
those powers, and this does not suffer us to believe that a man can conceive anything
greater than that honor. Wherefore one might with more justice indite those persons of arrogance
who accuse me of it. For they would never have suspected this of others if they had
not previously depreciated the matter as being of no account. But if they say that I have
done this with a view to glory, they will be convicted of fighting openly against themselves
and falling into their own snare; for I do not know what kind of arguments they could have
sought in preference to these if they had wished to release me from the charge of vainglory.</p>
<p>2. For if this desire had ever entered my mind, I ought to have accepted the office rather
than avoided it. Why? because it would have brought me much glory. For the fact that one
of my age, who had so recently abandoned secular pursuits, should suddenly be deemed by
all worthy of such admiration as to be advanced to honor before those who have spent all
their life in labors of this kind, and to obtain more votes than all of them, might have persuaded
all men to anticipate great and marvellous things of me. But, as it is, the greater part
of the Church does not know me even by name: so that even my refusal of the office will

<pb n="63"/>
not be manifest to all, but only to a few, and I am not sure that all even of these know it for
certain; but probably many of them either imagine that I was not elected at all, or that I was
rejected after the election, being considered unsuitable, not that I avoided the office of my
own accord.</p>
<p>3. Basil: But those who do know the truth will be surprised.</p>
<p>Chrysostom: And lo! these are they who, according to you, falsely accuse me of vainglory
and pride. Whence then am I to hope for praise? From the many? They do not know the
actual fact. From the few? Here again the matter is perverted to my disadvantage. For the
only reason why you have come here now is to learn what answer ought to be given to them.
And what shall I now certainly say on account of these things? For wait a little, and you will
clearly perceive that even if all know the truth they ought not to condemn me for pride and
love of glory. And in addition to this there is another consideration: that not only those who
make this venture, if there be any such (which for my part I do not believe), but also those
who suspect it of others, will be involved in no small danger.</p>
<p>4. For the priestly office is indeed discharged on earth, but it ranks amongst heavenly
ordinances; and very naturally so: for neither man, nor angel, nor archangel, nor any other
created power, but the Paraclete Himself, instituted this vocation, and persuaded men while
still abiding in the flesh to represent the ministry of angels. Wherefore the consecrated priest
ought to be as pure as if he were standing in the heavens themselves in the midst of those
powers. Fearful, indeed, and of most awful import, were the things which were used before
the dispensation of grace, as the bells, the pomegranates, the stones on the breastplate and
on the ephod, the girdle, the mitre, the long robe, the plate of gold, the holy of holies, the
deep silence within.86 But if any one should examine the things which belong to the dispensation
of grace, he will find that, small as they are, yet are they fearful and full of awe, and
that what was spoken concerning the law is true in this case also, that “what has been made
glorious hath no glory in this respect by reason of the glory which excelleth.”87 For when
thou seest the Lord sacrificed, and laid upon the altar,88 and the priest standing and praying
<note type="footnote">86 Exod. xxviii. 4 sq.</note>
<note type="footnote">87 2 Cor. iii. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">88 The Holy Eucharist is frequently called by St. Chrysostom and other Greek Fathers the Sacrifice, sometimes
the “unbloody Sacrifice,” partly as being an offering of praise and thanksgiving, partly as being a commemoration
or representation of the sacrifice of Christ. We must bear in mind that no controversy had then arisen about
this Sacrament, and that writers could freely use expressions which in later times would have been liable to objection
or misconstruction. The passage before us must be read in the light of other passages in Chrysostom’s works;
but one of these is sufficient to indicate the sense in which it is to be understood. In Homily xvii. c. 3. on the Epistle to
the Hebrews, after contrasting the many and ineffectual sacrifices of the Jews with the one perfect and efficient sacrifice
of Christ, he proceeds, “What then? do we not make an offering every day? We do, certainly, but by making a memorial
of His death; and this memorial is one, not many. How one, not many? Because the sacrifice was offered once for all, as</note>

<pb n="64"/>
over the victim, and all the worshippers empurpled with that precious blood,89 canst thou
then think that thou art still amongst men, and standing upon the earth? Art thou not, on
the contrary, straightway translated to Heaven, and casting out every carnal thought from
the soul, dost thou not with disembodied spirit and pure reason contemplate the things
which are in Heaven? Oh! what a marvel! what love of God to man! He who sitteth on high
with the Father is at that hour held in the hands of all,90 and gives Himself to those who are
willing to embrace and grasp Him. And this all do through the eyes of faith!91 Do these
things seem to you fit to be despised, or such as to make it possible for any one to be uplifted
against them?</p>
<p>Would you also learn from another miracle the exceeding sanctity of this office? Picture
Elijah and the vast multitude standing around him, and the sacrifice laid upon the altar of
stones, and all the rest of the people hushed into a deep silence while the prophet alone offers
up prayer: then the sudden rush of fire from Heaven upon the sacrifice:—these are marvellous
things, charged with terror. Now then pass from this scene to the rites which are celebrated
<note type="footnote">that great sacrifice was in the Holy of Holies. This is a figure of that great sacrifice, as that was of this: for we do not offer
one victim to-day and another to-morrow, but always the same: wherefore the sacrifice is one. Well, then, as He is offered
in many places, are there many Christs? No, by no means, but everywhere one Christ, complete both in this world and
in the other, one body. As then, though offered in many places, He is but one body, so is there but one sacrifice. Our
High Priest is He who offers the sacrifice which cleanses us. We offer that now which was offered then: which is indeed
inconsumable. This takes place now, for a memorial of what took place then. ‘Do this,’ said He, ‘for my memorial.’ We
do not then offer a different sacrifice, as the high priest formerly did, but always the same; or rather we celebrate a memorial
of a sacrifice.”</note>
<note type="footnote">89 This may be only a rhetorical expression, but perhaps there is an allusion to a custom which prevailed in
some churches, that the worshippers after receiving the cup applied the finger to the moistened lip, and then
touched their breast, eyes and ears.</note>
<note type="footnote">90 The caution mentioned just now in note 3 must be repeated here. A comparison of passages in the writings
of Chrysostom and his contemporaries proves clearly enough that they did not hold that the elements of bread
and wine were transmuted into the body and blood of Christ in such a sense as to cease to be bread and wine.
The authenticity of the letter of Chrysostom to Cæsarius is doubtful, but whoever the writer may have been, he
is clearly representing the current orthodox belief of the Church in his day. He maintains, in opposition to the
Apollinarian or perhaps the Eutychian heresy, that there are two complete natures in the one person of God the
Son Incarnate, and illustrates it by the following reference to the holy elements in the Eucharist: “Just as the
bread before consecration is called bread, but when the Divine Grace sanctifies it through the agency of the
priest it is released from the appellation of bread, and is deemed worthy of the appellation of the ‘Lord’s Body,’
although the nature of bread remains in it, and we speak not of two bodies, but one body of the Son: so here the
Divine nature being seated in the human body, the two together make up but one Son—one Person.”</note>

<pb n="65"/>
in the present day; they are not only marvellous to behold, but transcendent in terror. There
stands the priest, not bringing down fire from Heaven, but the Holy Spirit: and he makes
prolonged supplication,92 not that some flame sent down from on high may consume the
offerings, but that grace descending on the sacrifice may thereby enlighten the souls of all,
and render them more refulgent than silver purified by fire. Who can despise this most
awful mystery, unless he is stark mad and senseless? Or do you not know that no human
soul could have endured that fire in the sacrifice, but all would have been utterly consumed,
had not the assistance of God’s grace been great.</p>
<p>5. For if any one will consider how great a thing it is for one, being a man, and compassed
with flesh and blood, to be enabled to draw nigh to that blessed and pure nature, he will
then clearly see what great honor the grace of the Spirit has vouchsafed to priests; since by
their agency these rites are celebrated, and others nowise inferior to these both in respect
of our dignity and our salvation. For they who inhabit the earth and make their abode there
are entrusted with the administration of things which are in Heaven, and have received an
authority which God has not given to angels or archangels. For it has not been said to them,
“Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose
on earth shall be loosed in Heaven.”93 They who rule on earth have indeed authority to
bind, but only the body: whereas this binding lays hold of the soul and penetrates the
heavens; and what priests do here below God ratifies above, and the Master confirms the
sentence of his servants. For indeed what is it but all manner of heavenly authority which
He has given them when He says, “Whose sins ye remit they are remitted, and whose sins
ye retain they are retained?”94 What authority could be greater than this? “The Father hath
committed all judgment to the Son?”95 But I see it all put into the hands of these men by
the Son. For they have been conducted to this dignity as if they were already translated to
Heaven, and had transcended human nature, and were released from the passions to which
we are liable. Moreover, if a king should bestow this honor upon any of his subjects, authorizing
him to cast into prison whom he pleased and to release them again, he becomes an
object of envy and respect to all men; but he who has received from God an authority as
<note type="footnote">92 In the Liturgy which bears the name of St. Chrysostom, the following invocation of the Holy Spirit occurs:
“Grant that we may find grace in thy sight that our sacrifice may become acceptable to Thee, and that the Good
Spirit of thy grace may rest upon us, and upon these gifts spread before Thee, and upon all Thy people,” and
presently the deacon bids the people, “Let us pray on behalf of the precious gifts (i.e., the bread and wine) which
have been provided, that the merciful God who has received them upon His holy spiritual altar beyond the
heavens may in return send down upon us the divine grace and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost.”</note>

much greater as heaven is more precious than earth, and souls more precious than bodies,
seems to some to have received so small an honor that they are actually able to imagine that
one of those who have been entrusted with these things will despise the gift. Away with such
madness! For transparent madness it is to despise so great a dignity, without which it is not
possible to obtain either our own salvation, or the good things which have been promised
to us. For if no one can enter into the kingdom of Heaven except he be regenerate through
water and the Spirit, and he who does not eat the flesh of the Lord and drink His blood is
excluded from eternal life, and if all these things are accomplished only by means of those
holy hands, I mean the hands of the priest, how will any one, without these, be able to escape
the fire of hell, or to win those crowns which are reserved for the victorious?</p>
<p>6. These verily are they who are entrusted with the pangs of spiritual travail and the
birth which comes through baptism: by their means we put on Christ, and are buried with
the Son of God, and become members of that blessed Head. Wherefore they might not only
be more justly feared by us than rulers and kings, but also be more honored than parents;
since these begat us of blood and the will of the flesh, but the others are the authors of our
birth from God, even that blessed regeneration which is the true freedom and the sonship
according to grace. The Jewish priests had authority to release the body from leprosy, or,
rather, not to release it but only to examine those who were already released, and you know
how much the office of priest was contended for at that time. But our priests have received
authority to deal, not with bodily leprosy, but spiritual uncleanness—not to pronounce it
removed after examination, but actually and absolutely to take it away. Wherefore they who
despise these priests would be far more accursed than Dathan and his company, and deserve
more severe punishment. For the latter, although they laid claim to the dignity which did
not belong to them, nevertheless had an excellent opinion concerning it, and this they
evinced by the great eagerness with which they pursued it; but these men, when the office
has been better regulated, and has received so great a development, have displayed an audacity
which exceeds that of the others, although manifested in a contrary way. For there is not an
equal amount of contempt involved in aiming at an honor which does not pertain to one,
and in despising such great advantages, but the latter exceeds the former as much as scorn
differs from admiration. What soul then is so sordid as to despise such great advantages?
None whatever, I should say, unless it were one subject to some demoniacal impulse. For I
return once more to the point from which I started: not in the way of chastising only, but
also in the way of benefiting, God has bestowed a power on priests greater than that of our
natural parents. The two indeed differ as much as the present and the future life. For our
natural parents generate us unto this life only, but the others unto that which is to come.
And the former would not be able to avert death from their offspring, or to repel the assaults
of disease; but these others have often saved a sick soul, or one which was on the point of
perishing, procuring for some a milder chastisement, and preventing others from falling

<pb n="67"/>
altogether, not only by instruction and admonition, but also by the assistance wrought
through prayers. For not only at the time of regeneration, but afterwards also, they have
authority to forgive sins. “Is any sick among you?” it is said, “let him call for the elders of
the Church and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up: and if he have
committed sins they shall be forgiven him.”96 Again: our natural parents, should their
children come into conflict with any men of high rank and great power in the world, are
unable to profit them: but priests have reconciled, not rulers and kings, but God Himself
when His wrath has often been provoked against them.</p>
<p>Well! after this will any one venture to condemn me for arrogance? For my part, after
what has been said, I imagine such religious fear will possess the souls of the hearers that
they will no longer condemn those who avoid the office for arrogance and temerity, but
rather those who voluntarily come forward and are eager to obtain this dignity for themselves.
For if they who have been entrusted with the command of cities, should they chance to be
wanting in discretion and vigilance, have sometimes destroyed the cities and ruined themselves
in addition, how much power think you both in himself and from above must he
need, to avoid sinning, whose business it is to beautify the Bride of Christ?</p>
<p>7. No man loved Christ more than Paul: no man exhibited greater zeal, no man was
counted worthy of more grace: nevertheless, after all these great advantages, he still has fears
and tremblings concerning this government and those who were governed by him. “I fear,”
he says, “lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds
should be corrupted from the simplicity which is in Christ.”97 And again, “I was with you
in fear and in much trembling;”98 and this was a man who had been caught up to the third
Heaven, and made partaker of the unspeakable mysteries of God,99 and had endured as
many deaths as he had lived days after he became a believer—a man, moreover, who would
not use the authority given him from Christ lest any of his converts should be offended.100
If, then, he who went beyond the ordinances of God, and nowhere sought his own advantage,
but that of those whom he governed, was always so full of fear when he considered the
greatness of his government, what shall our condition be who in many ways seek our own,
who not only fail to go beyond the commandments of Christ, but for the most part transgress
them? “Who is weak,” he says, “and I am not weak? who is offended and I burn not?”101

Such an one ought the priest to be, or, rather, not such only: for these are small things, and
as nothing compared with what I am about to say. And what is this? “I could wish,” he says,
“that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the
flesh.”102 If any one can utter such a speech, if any one has the soul which attains to such a
prayer, he might justly be blamed if he took to flight: but if any one should lack such excellence
as much as I do, he would deserve to be hated, not if he avoided the office, but if he
accepted it. For if an election to a military dignity was the business in hand, and they who
had the right of conferring the honor were to drag forward a brazier, or a shoemaker, or
some such artisan, and entrust the army to his hands, I should not praise the wretched man
if he did not take to flight, and do all in his power to avoid plunging into such manifest
trouble. If, indeed, it be sufficient to bear the name of pastor, and to take the work in hand
hap-hazard, and there be no danger in this, then let whoso pleases accuse me of vainglory;
but if it behoves one who undertakes this care to have much understanding, and, before
understanding, great grace from God, and uprightness of conduct, and purity of life and
superhuman virtue, do not deprive me of forgiveness if I am unwilling to perish in vain
without a cause.</p>
<p>Moreover, if any one in charge of a full-sized merchant ship, full of rowers, and laden
with a costly freight, were to station me at the helm and bid me cross the Ægean or the
Tyrrhene sea, I should recoil from the proposal at once: and if any one asked me why? I
should say, “Lest I should sink the ship.” Well, where the loss concerns material wealth, and
the danger extends only to bodily death, no one will blame those who exercise great prudence;
but where the shipwrecked are destined to fall, not into the ocean, but into the abyss of fire,
and the death which awaits them is not that which severs the soul from the body, but one
which together with this dismisses it to eternal punishment, shall I incur your wrath and
hate because I did not plunge headlong into so great an evil?</p>
<p>8. Do not thus, I pray and beseech you. I know my own soul, how feeble and puny it is:
I know the magnitude of this ministry, and the great difficulty of the work; for more stormy
billows vex the soul of the priest than the gales which disturb the sea.</p>
<p>9. And first of all is that most terrible rock of vainglory, more dangerous than that of
the Sirens, of which the fable-mongers tell such marvellous tales: for many were able to sail
past that and escape unscathed; but this is to me so dangerous that even now, when no necessity
of any kind impels me into that abyss, I am unable to keep clear of the snare: but if
any one were to commit this charge to me, it would be all the same as if he tied my hands
behind my back, and delivered me to the wild beasts dwelling on that rock to rend me in
pieces day by day. Do you ask what those wild beasts are? They are wrath, despondency,
envy, strife, slanders, accusations, falsehood, hypocrisy, intrigues, anger against those who
<note type="footnote">102 Rom. ix. 3.</note>

<pb n="69"/>
have done no harm, pleasure at the indecorous acts of fellow ministers, sorrow at their
prosperity, love of praise, desire of honor (which indeed most of all drives the human soul
headlong to perdition), doctrines devised to please, servile flatteries, ignoble fawning, contempt
of the poor, paying court to the rich, senseless and mischievous honors, favors attended
with danger both to those who offer and those who accept them, sordid fear suited only to
the basest of slaves, the abolition of plain speaking, a great affectation of humility, but banishment
of truth, the suppression of convictions and reproofs, or rather the excessive use
of them against the poor, while against those who are invested with power no one dare open
his lips.</p>
<p>For all these wild beasts, and more than these, are bred upon that rock of which I have
spoken, and those whom they have once captured are inevitably dragged down into such a
depth of servitude that even to please women they often do many things which it is well not
to mention. The divine law indeed has excluded women from the ministry, but they endeavor
to thrust themselves into it; and since they can effect nothing of themselves, they do all
through the agency of others; and they have become invested with so much power that they
can appoint or eject priests at their will:103 things in fact are turned upside down, and the
proverbial saying may be seen realized—“The ruled lead the rulers:” and would that it were
men who do this instead of women, who have not received a commission to teach. Why do
I say teach? for the blessed Paul did not suffer them even to speak in the Church.104 But I
have heard some one say that they have obtained such a large privilege of free speech, as
even to rebuke the prelates of the Churches, and censure them more severely than masters
do their own domestics.</p>
<p>10. And let not any one suppose that I subject all to the aforesaid charges: for there are
some, yea many, who are superior to these entanglements, and exceed in number those who
have been caught by them. Nor would I indeed make the priesthood responsible for these
evils: far be such madness from me. For men of understanding do not say that the sword is
to blame for murder, nor wine for drunkenness, nor strength for outrage, nor courage for
foolhardiness, but they lay the blame on those who make an improper use of the gifts which
have been bestowed upon them by God, and punish them accordingly. Certainly, at least,
the priesthood may justly accuse us if we do not rightly handle it. For it is not itself a cause
of the evils already mentioned, but we, who as far as lies in our power have defiled it with
so many pollutions, by entrusting it to commonplace men who readily accept what is offered
them, without having first acquired a knowledge of their own souls, or considered the
gravity of the office, and when they have entered on the work, being blinded by inexperience,
<note type="footnote">103 Chrysostom himself experienced the truth of this, for it was through the influence of Eudoxia, the wife
of the Emperor Arcadius, that he was deposed from the See of Constantinople and banished.</note>

<pb n="70"/>
overwhelm with innumerable evils the people who have been committed to their care. This
is the very thing which was very nearly happening in my case, had not God speedily delivered
me from those dangers, mercifully sparing his Church and my own soul. For, tell me, whence
do you think such great troubles are generated in the Churches? I, for my part, believe the
only source of them to be the inconsiderate and random way in which prelates are chosen
and appointed. For the head ought to be the strongest part, that it may be able to regulate
and control the evil exhalations which arise from the rest of the body below; but when it
happens to be weak in itself, and unable to repel those pestiferous attacks, it becomes feebler
itself than it really is, and ruins the rest of the body as well. And to prevent this now coming
to pass, God kept me in the position of the feet, which was the rank originally assigned to
me. For there are very many other qualities, Basil, besides those already mentioned, which
the priest ought to have, but which I do not possess; and, above all, this one:—his soul ought
to be thoroughly purged from any lust after the office: for if he happens to have a natural
inclination for this dignity, as soon as he attains it a stronger flame is kindled, and the man
being taken completely captive will endure innumerable evils in order to keep a secure hold
upon it, even to the extent of using flattery, or submitting to something base and ignoble,
or expending large sums of money. For I will not now speak of the murders with which
some have filled the Churches,105 or the desolation which they have brought upon cities in
contending for the dignity, lest some persons should think what I say incredible. But I am
of opinion one ought to exercise so much caution in the matter, as to shun the burden of
the office,106 and when one has entered upon it, not to wait for the judgment of others
should any fault be committed which warrants deposition, but to anticipate it by ejecting
oneself from the dignity; for thus one might probably win mercy for himself from God: but
to cling to it in defiance of propriety is to deprive oneself of all forgiveness, or rather to
kindle the wrath of God, by adding a second error more offensive than the first.</p>
<p>11. But no one will always endure the strain; for fearful, truly fearful is the eager desire
after this honor. And in saying this I am not in opposition to the blessed Paul, but in complete
harmony with his words. For what says he? “If any man desireth the office of a bishop, he
desireth a good work.”107 Now I have not said that it is a terrible thing to desire the work,
but only the authority and power. And this desire I think one ought to expel from the soul
with all possible earnestness, not permitting it at the outset to be possessed by such a feeling,
so that one may be able to do everything with freedom. For he who does not desire to be

and Ursicinus for the See of Rome, A.D. 367, which Chrysostom probably had in his mind, 137 persons are said
to have been slain in one of the Churches in a single day.</note>

<pb n="71"/>
exhibited in possession of this authority, does not fear to be deposed from it, and not fearing
this will be able to do everything with the freedom which becomes Christian men: whereas
they who fear and tremble lest they should be deposed undergo a bitter servitude, filled with
all kinds of evils, and are often compelled to offend against both God and man. Now the
soul ought not to be affected in this way; but as in warfare we see those soldiers who are
noble-spirited fight willingly and fall bravely, so they who have attained to this stewardship
should be contented to be consecrated to the dignity or removed from it, as becomes
Christian men, knowing that deposition of this kind brings its reward no less than the discharge
of the office. For when any one suffers anything of this kind, in order to avoid submitting
to something which is unbecoming or unworthy of this dignity, he procures punishment
for those who wrongfully depose him, and a greater reward for himself. “Blessed,”
says our Lord, “are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner
of evil against you falsely for my sake; rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward
in Heaven.”108 And this, indeed, is the case when any one is expelled by those of his own
rank either on account of envy, with a view to the favor of others, or through hatred, or
from any other wrong motive: but when it is the lot of any one to experience this treatment
at the hand of opponents, I do not think a word is needed to prove what great gain they
confer upon him by their wickedness.</p>
<p>It behoves us, then, to be on the watch on all sides, and to make a careful search lest any
spark of this desire should be secretly smouldering somewhere. For it is much to be wished
that those who are originally free from this passion, should also be able to avoid it when
they have lighted upon this office. But if any one, before he obtains the honor, cherishes in
himself this terrible and savage monster, it is impossible to say into what a furnace he will
fling himself after he has attained it. Now I possessed this desire in a high degree (and do
not suppose that I would ever tell you what was untrue in self-disparagement): and this,
combined with other reasons, alarmed me not a little, and induced me to take flight. For
just as lovers of the human person, as long as they are permitted to be near the objects of
their affection, suffer more severe torment from their passion, but when they remove as far
as possible from these objects of desire, they drive away the frenzy: even so when those who
desire this dignity are near it, the evil becomes intolerable: but when they cease to hope for
it, the desire is extinguished together with the expectation.</p>
<p>12. This single motive then is no slight one: and even taken by itself it would have sufficed
to deter me from this dignity: but, as it is, another must be added not less than the former.
And what is this? A priest ought to be sober minded, and penetrating in discernment, and
possessed of innumerable eyes in every direction, as one who lives not for himself alone but
for so great a multitude. But that I am sluggish and slack, and scarcely able to bring about
<note type="footnote">108 Matt. v. 1.</note>

<pb n="72"/>
my own salvation, even you yourself would admit, who out of love to me art especially eager
to conceal my faults. Talk not to me in this connexion of fasting, and watching, or sleeping
on the ground, and other hard discipline of the body: for you know how defective I am in
these matters: and even if they had been carefully practised by me they could not with my
present sluggishness have been of any service to me with a view to this post of authority.
Such things might be of great service to a man who was shut up in a cell, and caring only
for his own concerns: but when a man is divided among so great a multitude, and enters
separately into the private cares of those who are under his direction, what appreciable help
can be given to their improvement unless he possesses a robust and exceedingly vigorous
character?</p>
<p>13. And do not be surprised if, in connexion with such endurance, I seek another test
of fortitude in the soul. For to be indifferent to food and drink and a soft bed, we see is to
many no hard task, especially at least to such as are of a rough habit of life and have been
brought up in this way from early youth, and to many others also; bodily discipline and
custom softening the severity of these laborious practices: but insult, and abuse, and coarse
language, and gibes from inferiors, whether wantonly or justly uttered, and rebukes vainly
and idly spoken both by rulers and the ruled—this is what few can bear, in fact only one or
two here and there; and one may see men, who are strong in the former exercises, so completely
upset by these things, as to become more furious than the most savage beasts. Now
such men especially we should exclude from the precincts of the priesthood. For if a prelate
did not loathe food, or go barefoot, no harm would be done to the common interests of the
Church; but a furious temper causes great disasters both to him who possesses it, and to his
neighbours. And there is no divine threat against those who fail to do the things referred
to, but hell and hell-fire are threatened against those who are angry without a cause.109 As
then the lover of vainglory, when he takes upon him the government of numbers, supplies
additional fuel to the fire, so he who by himself, or in the company of a few, is unable to
control his anger, but readily carried away by it, should he be entrusted with the direction
of a whole multitude, like some wild beast goaded on all sides by countless tormentors,
would never be able to live in tranquillity himself, and would cause incalculable mischief to
those who have been committed to his charge.</p>
<p>14. For nothing clouds the purity of the reason, and the perspicuity of the mental vision
so much as undisciplined wrath, rushing along with violent impetuosity. “For wrath,” says
one, “destroys even the prudent.”110 For the eye of the soul being darkened as in some
nocturnal battle is not able to distinguish friends from foes, nor the honorable from the
unworthy, but handles them all in turn in the same way; even if some harm must be suffered,
<note type="footnote">109 Matt. v. 22.</note>
<note type="footnote">110 Prov. xv. 1, the Septuagint Version.</note>

<pb n="73"/>
readily enduring everything, in order to satisfy the pleasure of the soul. For the fire of wrath
is a kind of pleasure, and tyrannizes over the soul more harshly than pleasure, completely
upsetting its healthy organization. For it easily impels men to arrogance, and unseasonable
enmities, and unreasonable hatred, and it continually makes them ready to commit wanton
and vain offences; and forces them to say and do many other things of that kind, the soul
being swept along by the rush of passion, and having nothing on which to fasten its strength
and resist so great an impulse.</p>
<p>Basil: I will not endure this irony of yours any longer: for who knows not how far removed
you are from this infirmity?</p>
<p>Chrysostom: Why then, my good friend, do you wish to bring me near the pyre, and to
provoke the wild beast when he is tranquil? Are you not aware that I have achieved this
condition, not by any innate virtue, but by my love of retirement? and that when one who
is so constituted remains contented by himself, or only associates with one or two friends,
he is able to escape the fire which arises from this passion, but not if he has plunged into
the abyss of all these cares? for then he drags not only himself but many others with him to
the brink of destruction, and renders them more indifferent to all consideration for mildness.
For the mass of people under government are generally inclined to regard the manners of
those who govern as a kind of model type, and to assimilate themselves to them. How then
could any one put a stop to their fury when he is swelling himself with rage? And who
amongst the multitude would straightway desire to become moderate when he sees the ruler
irritable? For it is quite impossible for the defects of priests to be concealed, but even trifling
ones speedily become manifest. So an athlete, as long as he remains at home, and contends
with no one, can dissemble his weakness even if it be very great, but when he strips for the
contest he is easily detected. And thus for some who live this private and inactive life, their
isolation serves as a veil to hide their defects; but when they have been brought into public
they are compelled to divest themselves of this mantle of seclusion, and to lay bare their
souls to all through their visible movements. As therefore their right deeds profit many, by
provoking them to equal zeal, so their shortcomings make men more indifferent to the
practice of virtue, and encourage them to indolence in their endeavours after what is excellent.
Wherefore his soul ought to gleam with beauty on every side, that it may be able to gladden
and to enlighten the souls of those who behold it. For the faults of ordinary men, being
committed as it were in the dark, ruin only those who practise them: but the errors of a man
in a conspicuous position, and known to many, inflicts a common injury upon all, rendering
those who have fallen more supine in their efforts for good, and driving to desperation those
who wish to take heed to themselves. And apart from these things, the faults of insignificant
men, even if they are exposed, inflict no injury worth speaking of upon any one: but they
who occupy the highest seat of honor are in the first place plainly visible to all, and if they
err in the smallest matters these trifles seem great to others: for all men measure the sin, not

<pb n="74"/>
by the magnitude of the offence, but by the rank of the offender. Thus the priest ought to
be protected on all sides by a kind of adamantine armour, by intense earnestness, and perpetual
watchfulness concerning his manner of life, lest some one discovering an exposed
and neglected spot should inflict a deadly wound: for all who surround him are ready to
smite and overthrow him: not enemies only and adversaries, but many even of those who
profess friendship.</p>
<p>The souls therefore of men elected to the priesthood ought to be endued with such
power as the grace of God bestowed on the bodies of those saints who were cast into the
Babylonian furnace.111 Faggot and pitch and tow are not the fuel of this fire, but things far
more dreadful: for it is no material fire to which they are subjected, but the all-devouring
flame of envy encompasses them, rising up on every side, and assailing them, and putting
their life to a more searching test than the fire then was to the bodies of those young men.
When then it finds a little trace of stubble, it speedily fastens upon it; and this unsound part
it entirely consumes, but all the rest of the fabric, even if it be brighter than the sunbeams,
is scorched and blackened by the smoke. For as long as the life of the priest is well regulated
in every direction, it is invulnerable to plots; but if he happens to overlook some trifle, as is
natural in a human being, traversing the treacherous ocean of this life, none of his other
good deeds are of any avail in enabling him to escape the mouths of his accusers; but that
little blunder overshadows all the rest. And all men are ready to pass judgment on the priest
as if he was not a being clothed with flesh, or one who inherited a human nature, but like
an angel, and emancipated from every species of infirmity. And just as all men fear and
flatter a tyrant as long as he is strong, because they cannot put him down, but when they
see his affairs going adversely, those who were his friends a short time before abandon their
hypocritical respect, and suddenly become his enemies and antagonists, and having discovered
all his weak points, make an attack upon him, and depose him from the government;
so is it also in the case of priests. Those who honored him and paid court to him a short
time before, while he was strong, as soon as they have found some little handle eagerly prepare
to depose him, not as a tyrant only, but something far more dreadful than that. And as the
tyrant fears his body guards, so also does the priest dread most of all his neighbours and
fellow-ministers. For no others covet his dignity so much, or know his affairs so well as
these; and if anything occurs, being near at hand, they perceive it before others, and even if
they slander him, can easily command belief, and, by magnifying trifles, take their victim
captive. For the apostolic saying is reversed, “whether one member suffer, all the members
suffer with it; or one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it;”112 unless indeed
a man should be able by his great discretion to stand his ground against everything.</p>

<p>Are you then for sending me forth into so great a warfare? and did you think that my
soul would be equal to a contest so various in character and shape? Whence did you learn
this, and from whom? If God certified this to you, show me the oracle, and I obey; but if
you cannot, and form your judgment from human opinion only, please to set yourself free
from this delusion. For in what concerns my own affairs it is fairer to trust me than others;
inasmuch as “no man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him.”113
That I should have made myself and my electors ridiculous, had I accepted this office, and
should with great loss have returned to this condition of life in which I now am, I trust I
have now convinced you by these remarks, if not before. For not malice only, but something
much stronger—the lust after this dignity—is wont to arm many against one who possesses
it. And just as avaricious children are oppressed by the old age of their parents, so some of
these, when they see the priestly office held by any one for a protracted time—since it would
be wickedness to destroy him—hasten to depose him from it, being all desirous to take his
place, and each expecting that the dignity will be transferred to himself.</p>
<p>15. Would you like me to show you yet another phase of this strife, charged with innumerable
dangers? Come, then, and take a peep at the public festivals when it is generally the
custom for elections to be made to ecclesiastical dignities, and you will then see the priest
assailed with accusations as numerous as the people whom he rules. For all who have the
privilege of conferring the honor are then split into many parties; and one can never find
the council of elders114 of one mind with each other, or about the man who has won the
prelacy; but each stands apart from the others, one preferring this man, another that. Now
the reason is that they do not all look to one thing, which ought to be the only object kept
in view, the excellence of the character; but other qualifications are alleged as recommending
to this honor; for instance, of one it is said, “let him be elected because he belongs to an illustrious
family,” of another “because he is possessed of great wealth, and would not need
to be supported out of the revenues of the Church,” of a third “because he has come over
from the camp of the adversary;” one is eager to give the preference to a man who is on
<note type="footnote">113 1 Cor. ii. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">114 It is not possible to say precisely who the electors to bishoprics were at this time, but probably a mixed
body of the clergy and leading laymen of the diocese. Chrysostom calls the electors “fathers,” i. ch. 6, and “great
men,” ch. 7, and here he speaks of a “council of elders,” which may mean the whole body of clergy of the second
order, or a select body of laymen, or possibly the two combined. In one way or other, during the first five centuries,
the people certainly had a considerable voice in the election of bishops. Socrates, the historian, vi. c. 2,
says that Chrysostom himself was chosen for the See of Constantinople “by the common vote of all, clergy and
people.” Pope Leo (A.D. 440–461) lays down the rule that “when the election of a bishop is handled he is to be
preferred who is demanded by the unanimous consent of clergy and people.” Epist. 84. A law of the Emperor
Justinian restricted the right of election to the clergy and the “optimates” or people of chief rank.</note>

<pb n="76"/>
terms of intimacy with himself, another to the man who is related to him by birth, a third
to the flatterer, but no one will look to the man who is really qualified, or make some test
of his character. Now I am so far from thinking these things trustworthy criteria of a man’s
fitness for the priesthood, that even if any one manifested great piety, which is no small help
in the discharge of that office, I should not venture to approve him on that account alone,
unless he happened to combine good abilities with his piety. For I know many men who
have exercised perpetual restraint upon themselves, and consumed themselves with fastings,
who, as long as they were suffered to be alone, and attend to their own concerns, have been
acceptable to God, and day by day have made no small addition to this kind of learning; but
as soon as they entered public life, and were compelled to correct the ignorance of the
multitude, have, some of them, proved from the outset incompetent for so great a task, and
others when forced to persevere in it, have abandoned their former strict way of living, and
thus inflicted great injury on themselves without profiting others at all. And if any one spent
his whole time in the lowest rank of the ministry, and reached extreme old age, I would not,
merely out of reverence for his years, promote him to the higher dignity; for what if, after
arriving at that time of life, he should still remain unfit for the office? And I say this now,
not as wishing to dishonor the grey head, nor as laying down a law absolutely to exclude
from this authority those who come from the monastic circle (for there are instances of
many who issued from that body, having shone conspicuously in this dignity); but the point
which I am anxious to prove is, that if neither piety of itself, nor advanced age, would suffice
to show that a man who had obtained the priesthood really deserved it, the reasons formerly
alleged would scarcely effect this. There are also men who bring forward other pretexts yet
more absurd; for some are enrolled in the ranks of the clergy, that they may not range
themselves among opponents, and others on account of their evil disposition, lest they
should do great mischief if they are overlooked. Could anything be more contrary to right
rule than this? that bad men, laden with iniquity, should be courted on account of those
things for which they ought to be punished, and ascend to the priestly dignity on account
of things for which they ought to be debarred from the very threshold of the Church. Tell
me, then, shall we seek any further the cause of God’s wrath, when we expose things so holy
and awful to be defiled by men who are either wicked or worthless? for when some men are
entrusted with the administration of things which are not at all suitable to them, and others
of things which exceed their natural power, they make the condition of the Church like that
of Euripus.115</p>
<p>Now formerly I used to deride secular rulers, because in the distribution of their honors
they are not guided by considerations of moral excellence, but of wealth, and seniority, and
<note type="footnote">115 A narrow strait between the island of Euboea and the mainland of Greece, in which the tide was very
rapid. Hence the “condition of Euripus” became a proverbial expression indicative of agitation and fluctuation.</note>

<pb n="77"/>
human distinction; but when I heard that this kind of folly had forced its way into our affairs
also, I no longer regarded their conduct as so atrocious. For what wonder is it that worldly
men, who love the praise of the multitude, and do everything for the sake of gain, should
commit these sins, when those who affect at least to be free from all these influences are in
no wise better disposed than they, but although engaged in a contest for heavenly things,
act as if the question submitted for decision was one which concerned acres of land, or
something else of that kind? for they take commonplace men off-hand, and set them to
preside over those things, for the sake of which the only begotten Son of God did not refuse
to empty Himself of His glory and become man, and take the form of a servant, and be spat
upon, and buffeted, and die a death of reproach in the flesh. Nor do they stop even here,
but add to these offences others still more monstrous; for not only do they elect unworthy
men, but actually expel those who are well qualified. As if it were necessary to ruin the safety
of the Church on both sides, or as if the former provocation were not sufficient to kindle
the wrath of God, they have contrived yet another not less pernicious. For I consider it as
atrocious to expel the useful men as to force in the useless. And this in fact takes place, so
that the flock of Christ is unable to find consolation in any direction, or draw its breath
freely. Now do not such deeds deserve to be punished by ten thousand thunder-bolts, and
a hell-fire hotter than that with which we are threatened [in Holy Scripture]? Yet these
monstrous evils are borne with by Him who willeth not the death of a sinner, that he may
be converted and live. And how can one sufficiently marvel at His lovingkindness, and be
amazed at His mercy? They who belong to Christ destroy the property of Christ more than
enemies and adversaries, yet the good Lord still deals gently with them, and calls them to
repentance. Glory be to Thee, O Lord! Glory to Thee! How vast is the depth of Thy lovingkindness!
how great the riches of Thy forbearance! Men who on account of Thy name have
risen from insignificance and obscurity to positions of honor and distinction, use the honor
they enjoy against Him who has bestowed it, do deeds of outrageous audacity, and insult
holy things, rejecting and expelling men of zeal in order that the wicked may ruin everything
at their pleasure in much security, and with the utmost fearlessness. And if you would know
the causes of this dreadful evil, you will find that they are similar to those which were mentioned
before; for they have one root and mother, so to say—namely, envy; but this is
manifested in several different forms. For one we are told is to be struck out of the list of
candidates, because he is young; another because he does not know how to flatter; a third
because he has offended such and such a person; a fourth lest such and such a man should
be pained at seeing one whom he has presented rejected, and this man elected; a fifth because
he is kind and gentle; a sixth because he is formidable to the sinful; a seventh for some other
like reason; for they are at no loss to find as many pretexts as they want, and can even make
the abundance of a man’s wealth an objection when they have no other. Indeed they would
be capable of discovering other reasons, as many as they wish, why a man ought not to be

<pb n="78"/>
brought suddenly to this honor, but gently and gradually. And here I should like to ask the
question, “What, then, is the prelate to do, who has to contend with such blasts? How shall
he hold his ground against such billows? How shall he repel all these assaults?”</p>
<p>For if he manages the business116 upon upright principles, all those who are enemies
and adversaries both to him and to the candidates do everything with a view to contention,
provoking daily strife, and heaping infinite scorn upon the candidates, until they have got
them struck off the list, or have introduced their own favorites. In fact it is just as if some
pilot had pirates sailing with him in his ship, perpetually plotting every hour against him,
and the sailors, and marines. And if he should prefer favor with such men to his own salvation,
accepting unworthy candidates, he will have God for his enemy in their stead; and
what could be more dreadful than that? And yet his relations with them will be more embarrassing
than formerly, as they will all combine with each other, and thereby become more
powerful than before. For as when fierce winds coming from opposite directions clash with
one another, the ocean, hitherto calm, becomes suddenly furious and raises its crested waves,
destroying those who are sailing over it, so also when the Church has admitted corrupt men,
its once tranquil surface is covered with rough surf and strewn with shipwrecks.</p>
<p>16. Consider, then, what kind of man he ought to be who is to hold out against such a
tempest, and to manage skillfully such great hindrances to the common welfare; for he ought
to be dignified yet free from arrogance, formidable yet kind, apt to command yet sociable,
impartial yet courteous, humble yet not servile, strong yet gentle, in order that he may
contend successfully against all these difficulties. And he ought to bring forward with great
authority the man who is properly qualified for the office, even if all should oppose him,
and with the same authority to reject the man who is not so qualified, even if all should
conspire in his favor, and to keep one aim only in view, the building up of the Church, in
nothing actuated either by enmity or favor. Well, do you now think that I acted reasonably
in declining the ministry of this office? But I have not even yet gone through all my reasons
with you; for I have some others still to mention. And do not grow impatient of listening
to a friendly and sincere man, who wishes to clear himself from your accusations; for these
statements are not only serviceable for the defence which you have to make on my behalf,
but they will also prove of no small help for the due administration of the office. For it is
necessary for one who is going to enter upon this path of life to investigate all matters
thoroughly well, before he sets his hand to the ministry. Do you ask why? Because one who
knows all things clearly will have this advantage, if no other, that he will not feel strange
when these things befall him. Would you like me then to approach the question of superintending
widows, first of all, or of the care of virgins, or the difficulty of the judicial function.
<note type="footnote">116 i.e., the business of elections. Chrysostom seems to have passed on from the elections of bishops to the
consideration of elections to clerical offices over which the bishop had to preside.</note>

<pb n="79"/>
For in each of these cases there is a different kind of anxiety, and the fear is greater than the
anxiety.</p>
<p>Now in the first place, to start from that subject which seems to be simpler than the
others, the charge of widows appears to cause anxiety to those who take care of them only
so far as the expenditure of money is concerned; but the case is otherwise, and here also a
careful scrutiny is needed, when they have to be enrolled,117 for infinite mischief has been
caused by putting them on the list without due discrimination. For they have ruined
households, and severed marriages, and have often been detected in thieving and pilfering
and unseemly deeds of that kind. Now that such women should be supported out of the
Church’s revenues provokes punishment from God, and extreme condemnation among
men, and abates the zeal of those who wish to do good. For who would ever choose to expend
the wealth which he was commanded to give to Christ upon those who defame the name
of Christ? For these reasons a strict and accurate scrutiny ought to be made so as to prevent
the supply of the indigent being wasted, not only by the women already mentioned, but also
by those who are able to provide for themselves. And this scrutiny is succeeded by no small
anxiety of another kind, to ensure an abundant and unfailing stream of supply as from a
fountain; for compulsory poverty is an insatiable kind of evil, querulous and ungrateful.
And great discretion and great zeal is required so as to stop the mouths of complainers,
depriving them of every excuse. Now most men, when they see any one superior to the love
of money, forthwith represent him as well qualified for this stewardship. But I do not think
that this greatness of soul is ever sufficient of itself, although it ought to be possessed prior
to all other qualities; for without this a man would be a destroyer rather than a protector, a
wolf instead of a shepherd; nevertheless, combined with this, the possession of another
quality also should be demanded. And this quality is forbearance, the cause of all good things
in men, impelling as it were and conducting the soul into a serene haven. For widows are a
class who, both on account of their poverty, their age and natural disposition, indulge in
unlimited freedom of speech (so I had best call it); and they make an unseasonable clamor
and idle complaints and lamentations about matters for which they ought to be grateful,
and bring accusations concerning things which they ought contentedly to accept. Now the
superintendent should endure all these things in a generous spirit, and not be provoked
<note type="footnote">117 That is, “put upon the Church-roll.” From apostolic times as we know from 1 Tim. v. 9, 10, the Church
had recognized the care of widows as a duty; but one to be exercised with caution, lest unworthy persons should
take advantage of it. In Chrysostom’s time there was an “order of widows,” which had departed very much from
the primitive simplicity and devotion to religious works which distinguished the order of earlier days. The
Church strongly encouraged abstinence from a second marriage: and many women seem to have taken a vow
of widowhood, and secured a place in the Church-roll, only in the hope of throwing a decent veil over an irreligious,
if not immoral life.</note>

<pb n="80"/>
either by their unreasonable annoyance or their unreasonable complaints. For this class of
persons deserve to be pitied for their misfortunes, not to be insulted; and to trample upon
their calamities, and add the pain of insult to that which poverty brings, would be an act of
extreme brutality. On this account one of the wisest of men, having regard to the avarice
and pride of human nature, and considering the nature of poverty and its terrible power to
depress even the noblest character, and induce it often to act in these same respects without
shame, in order that a man should not be irritated when accused, nor be provoked by continual
importunity to become an enemy where he ought to bring aid, he instructs him to
be affable and accessible to the suppliant, saying, “Incline thine ear to a poor man and give
him a friendly answer with meekness.”118 And passing by the case of one who succeeds in
exasperating (for what can one say to him who is overcome?), he addresses the man who is
able to bear the other’s infirmity, exhorting him before he bestows his gift to correct the
suppliant by the gentleness of his countenance and the mildness of his words. But if any
one, although he does not take the property (of these widows), nevertheless loads them with
innumerable reproaches, and insults them, and is exasperated against them, he not only
fails through his gift to alleviate the despondency produced by poverty, but aggravates the
distress by his abuse. For although they may be compelled to act very shamelessly through
the necessity of hunger, they are nevertheless distressed at this compulsion. When, then,
owing to the dread of famine, they are constrained to beg, and owing to their begging are
constrained to put off shame, and then again on account of their shamelessness are insulted,
the power of despondency becoming of a complex kind, and accompanied by much gloom,
settles down upon the soul. And one who has the charge of these persons ought to be so
long-suffering, as not only not to increase their despondency by his fits of anger, but also
to remove the greater part of it by his exhortation. For as the man who has been insulted,
although he is in the enjoyment of great abundance, does not feel the advantage of his wealth,
on account of the blow which he has received from the insult; so on the other hand, the man
who has been addressed with kindly words, and for whom the gift has been accompanied
with encouragement, exults and rejoices all the more, and the thing given becomes doubled
in value through the manner in which it is offered. And this I say not of myself, but borrow
from him whose precept I quoted just now: “My son, blemish not thy good deeds, neither
use uncomfortable words when thou givest anything. Shall not the dew assuage the heat?
So is a word better than a gift. Lo! is not a word better than a gift? but both are with a gracious
man.”119</p>
<p>But the superintendent of these persons ought not only to be gentle and forbearing, but
also skillful in the management of property; for if this qualification is wanting, the affairs
<note type="footnote">118 Ecclus. iv. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">119 Ecclus. xviii. 15–17.</note>

<pb n="81"/>
of the poor are again involved in the same distress. One who was entrusted not long ago
with this ministry, and got together a large hoard of money, neither consumed it himself,
nor expended it with a few exceptions upon those who needed it, but kept the greater part
of it buried in the earth until a season of distress occurred, when it was all surrendered into
the hands of the enemy. Much forethought, therefore, is needed, that the resources of the
Church should be neither over abundant, nor deficient, but that all the supplies which are
provided should be quickly distributed among those who require them, and the treasures
of the Church stored up in the hearts of those who are under her rule.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the reception of strangers, and the care of the sick, consider how great an
expenditure of money is needed, and how much exactness and discernment on the part of
those who preside over these matters. For it is often necessary that this expenditure should
be even larger than that of which I spoke just now, and that he who presides over it should
combine prudence and wisdom with skill in the art of supply, so as to dispose the affluent
to be emulous and ungrudging in their gifts, lest while providing for the relief of the sick,
he should vex the souls of those who supply their wants. But earnestness and zeal need to
be displayed here in a far higher degree; for the sick are difficult creatures to please, and
prone to languor; and unless great accuracy and care are used, even a slight oversight is
enough to do the patient great mischief.</p>
<p>17. But in the care of virgins, the fear is greater in proportion as the possession is more
precious, and this flock is of a nobler character than the others. Already, indeed, even into
the band of these holy ones, an infinite number of women have rushed full of innumerable
bad qualities; and in this case our grief is greater than in the other; for there is just the same
difference between a virgin and a widow going astray, as between a free-born damsel and
her handmaid. With widows, indeed, it has become a common practice to trifle, and to rail
at one another, to flatter or to be impudent, to appear everywhere in public, and to perambulate
the market-place. But the virgin has striven for nobler aims, and eagerly sought the
highest kind of philosophy,120 and professes to exhibit upon earth the life which angels lead,
and while yet in the flesh proposes to do deeds which belong to the incorporeal powers.
Moreover, she ought not to make numerous or unnecessary journeys, neither is it permissible
for her to utter idle and random words; and as for abuse and flattery, she should not even
know them by name. On this account she needs the most careful guardianship, and the
<note type="footnote">120 i.e., a life of religious contemplation, not, however, as a member of a monastic community, for Chrysostom,
throughout this section, appears to be speaking of the canonical or ecclesiastical virgins who were consecrated
to a religious life, yet remained at home under the care of their parents (if living) or of the Church. The first
notices of separate houses for women who had taken the vow of virginity occur in the middle of the 4th century.
St. Ambrose mentions one at Bologna. De Virg. i. 10. St. Basil is said to have founded some (see St. Greg. Naz.
Orat. 47).</note>

<pb n="82"/>
greater assistance. For the enemy of holiness is always surprising and lying in wait for these
persons, ready to devour any one of them if she should slip and fall; many men also there
are who lay snares for them; and besides all these things there is the passionateness of their
own human nature, so that, speaking generally, the virgin has to equip herself for a twofold
war, one which attacks her from without, and the other which presses upon her from within.
For these reasons he who has the superintendence of virgins suffers great alarm, and the
danger and distress is yet greater, should any of the things which are contrary to his wishes
occur, which God forbid. For if a daughter kept in seclusion is a cause of sleeplessness to
her father, his anxiety about her depriving him of sleep, where the fear is so great lest she
should be childless, or pass the flower of her age (unmarried), or be hated (by her husband),
121 what will he suffer whose anxiety is not concerned with any of these things, but
others far greater? For in this case it is not a man who is rejected, but Christ Himself, nor
is this barrenness the subject merely of reproach, but the evil ends in the destruction of the
soul; “for every tree,” it is said, “which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down and cast
into the fire.”122 And for one who has been repudiated by the divine Bridegroom, it is not
sufficient to receive a certificate of divorce and so to depart, but she has to pay the penalty
of everlasting punishment. Moreover, a father according to the flesh has many things which
make the custody of his daughter easy; for the mother, and nurse, and a multitude of
handmaids share in helping the parent to keep the maiden safe. For neither is she permitted
to be perpetually hurrying into the market-place, nor when she does go there is she compelled
to show herself to any of the passers-by, the evening darkness concealing one who does not
wish to be seen no less than the walls of the house. And apart from these things, she is relieved
from every cause which might otherwise compel her to meet the gaze of men; for no anxiety
about the necessaries of life, no menaces of oppressors, nor anything of that kind reduces
her to this unfortunate necessity, her father acting in her stead in all these matters; while
she herself has only one anxiety, which is to avoid doing or saying anything unworthy the
modest conduct which becomes her. But in the other case there are many things which make
the custody of the virgin difficult, or rather impossible for the father; for he could not have
her in his house with himself, as dwelling together in that way would be neither seemly nor
safe. For even if they themselves should suffer no loss, but continue to preserve their innocence
unsullied, they would have to give an account for the souls which they have offended,
just as much as if they happened to sin with one another. And it being impossible for them
to live together, it is not easy to understand the movements of the character, and to suppress
the impulses which are ill regulated, or train and improve those which are better ordered
and tuned. Nor is it an easy thing to interfere in her habits of walking out; for her poverty
<note type="footnote">121 Ecclus. xlii. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">122 Matt. iii. 10.</note>

<pb n="83"/>
and want of a guardian does not permit him to become an exact investigator of the propriety
of her conduct. For as she is compelled to manage all her affairs she has many pretexts for
going out, if at least she is not inclined to be self-controlled. Now he who commands her to
stay always at home ought to cut off these pretexts, providing for her independence in the
necessaries of life, and giving her some woman who will see to the management of these
things. He must also keep her away from funeral obsequies, and nocturnal festivals; for that
artful serpent knows only too well how to scatter his poison through the medium even of
good deeds. And the maiden must be fenced on every side, and rarely go out of the house
during the whole year, except when she is constrained by inexorable necessity. Now if any
one should say that none of these things is the proper work of a bishop to take in hand, let
him be assured that the anxieties and the reasons concerning what takes place in every case
have to be referred to him. And it is far more expedient that he should manage everything,
and so be delivered from the complaints which he must otherwise undergo on account of
the faults of others, than that he should abstain from the management, and then have to
dread being called to account for things which other men have done. Moreover, he who
does these things by himself, gets through them all with great ease; but he who is compelled
to do it by converting every one’s opinion does not get relief by being saved from working
single-handed, equivalent to the trouble and turmoil which he experiences through those
who oppose him and combat his decisions. However, I could not enumerate all the anxieties
concerned with the care of virgins; for when they have to be entered on the list, they occasion
no small trouble to him who is entrusted with this business.</p>
<p>Again, the judicial department of the bishop’s office involves innumerable vexations,
great consumption of time, and difficulties exceeding those experienced by men who sit to
judge secular affairs; for it is a labor to discover exact justice, and when it is found, it is difficult
to avoid destroying it. And not only loss of time and difficulty are incurred, but also
no small danger. For ere now, some of the weaker brethren having plunged into business,
because they have not obtained patronage have made shipwreck concerning the faith. For
many of those who have suffered wrong, no less than those who have inflicted wrong, hate
those who do not assist them, and they will not take into account either the intricacy of the
matters in question, or the difficulty of the times, or the limits of sacerdotal authority, or
anything of that kind; but they are merciless judges, recognizing only one kind of defence—release
from the evils which oppress them. And he who is unable to furnish this, although he
may allege innumerable excuses, will never escape their condemnation.</p>
<p>And talking of patronage, let me disclose another pretext for fault-finding. For if the
bishop does not pay a round of visits every day, more even than the idle men about town,
unspeakable offence ensues. For not only the sick, but also the whole, desire to be looked
after, not that piety prompts them to this, but rather that in most cases they pretend claims
to honor and distinction. And if he should ever happen to visit more constantly one of the

<pb n="84"/>
richer and more powerful men, under the pressure of some necessity, with a view to the
common benefit of the Church, he is immediately stigmatized with a character for fawning
and flattery. But why do I speak of patronage and visiting? For merely from their mode of
accosting persons, bishops have to endure such a load of reproaches as to be often oppressed
and overwhelmed by despondency; in fact, they have also to undergo a scrutiny of the way
in which they use their eyes. For the public rigorously criticize their simplest actions, taking
note of the tone of their voice, the cast of their countenance, and the degree of their laughter.
He laughed heartily to such a man, one will say, and accosted him with a beaming face, and
a clear voice, whereas to me he addressed only a slight and passing remark. And in a large
assembly, if he does not turn his eyes in every direction when he is conversing, the majority
declare that his conduct is insulting.</p>
<p>Who, then, unless he is exceedingly strong, could cope with so many accusers, so as
either to avoid being indited altogether, or, if he is indited, to escape? For he must either be
without any accusers, or, if this is impossible, purge himself of the accusations which are
brought against him; and if this again is not an easy matter, as some men delight in making
vain and wanton charges, he must make a brave stand against the dejection produced by
these complaints. He, indeed, who is justly accused, may easily tolerate the accuser, for there
is no bitterer accuser than conscience; wherefore, if we are caught first by this most terrible
adversary, we can readily endure the milder ones who are external to us. But he who has no
evil thing upon his conscience, when he is subjected to an empty charge, is speedily excited
to wrath, and easily sinks into dejection, unless he happens to have practised beforehand
how to put up with the follies of the multitude. For it is utterly impossible for one who is
falsely accused without cause, and condemned, to avoid feeling some vexation and annoyance
at such great injustice.</p>
<p>And how can one speak of the distress which bishops undergo, whenever it is necessary
to cut some one off from the full communion of the Church? Would indeed that the evil
went no further than distress! but in fact the mischief is not trifling. For there is a fear lest
the man, if he has been punished beyond what he deserves, should experience that which
was spoken of by the blessed Paul and “be swallowed up by overmuch sorrow.”123 The nicest
accuracy, therefore, is required in this matter also, lest what is intended to be profitable
should become to him an occasion of greater damage. For whatever sins he may commit
after such a method of treatment, the wrath caused by each of them must be shared by the
physician who so unskillfully applied his knife to the wound. What severe punishment,
then, must be expected by one who has not only to render an account of the offences which
he himself has separately committed, but also incurs extreme danger on account of the sins
committed by others? For if we shudder at undergoing judgment for our own misdeeds,
<note type="footnote">123 2 Cor. ii. 7.</note>

<pb n="85"/>
believing that we shall not be able to escape the fire of the other world, what must one expect
to suffer who has to answer for so many others? To prove the truth of this, listen to the
blessed Paul, or rather not to him, but to Christ speaking in him, when he says: “Obey them
that have the rule over you, and submit, for they watch for your souls as they that shall give
account.”124 Can the dread of this threat be slight? It is impossible to say: but these considerations
are sufficient to convince even the most incredulous and obdurate that I did not
make this escape under the influence of pride or vainglory, but merely out of fear for my
own safety, and consideration of the gravity of the office.</p>

<p>Basil heard this, and after a little pause thus replied:</p>
<p>If thou wert thyself ambitious of obtaining this office, thy fear would have been reasonable;
for in being ambitious of undertaking it, a man confesses himself to be qualified for
its administration, and if he fail therein, after it has been entrusted to him, he cannot take
refuge in the plea of inexperience, for he has deprived himself of this excuse beforehand,125
by having hurriedly seized upon the ministry, and whoever willingly and deliberately enters
upon it, can no longer say, “I have sinned in this matter against my will—and against my
will I have ruined such and such a soul;” for He who will one day judge him, will say to him,
“Since then thou wert conscious of such inexperience, and hadst not ability for undertaking
this matter without incurring reproach, why wert thou so eager and presumptuous as to
take in hand what was so far beyond thy power? Who compelled thee to do so? Didst thou
shrink or fly, and did any one drag thee on by force?” But thou wilt hear nothing like this,
for thou canst have nothing of this kind to condemn thyself for; and it is evident to all that
thou wert in no degree ambitious of this dignity, for the accomplishment of the matter was
due to the action of others. Hence, circumstances which leave those who are ambitious of
this office no chance of pardon when they err therein, afford thee ample ground for excuse.</p>
<p>Chrysostom: At this I shook my head and smiled a little, admiring the simple-mindedness
of the man, and thus addressed him: I could wish indeed that matters were as thou sayest,
most excellent of men, but not in order that I might be able to accept that office from which
I lately fled. For if, indeed, no chastisement were to await me for undertaking the care of
the flock of Christ without consideration and experience, yet to me it would be worse than
all punishment, after being entrusted with so great a charge, to have seemed so base towards
Him who entrusted me with it. For what reason, then, did I wish that thou wert not mistaken
in this opinion of thine? truly for the sake of those wretched and unhappy beings (for so
must I call them, who have not found out how to discharge the duties of this office well,
though thou wert to say ten thousand times over that they had been driven to undertake it,
and that, therefore, their errors therein are sins of ignorance)—for the sake, I say, of such
that they might succeed in escaping that unquenchable fire, and the outer darkness126 and
the worm that dieth not127 and the punishment of being cut asunder,128 and perishing together
with the hypocrites.</p>

<p>But what am I to do for thee? It is not as thou sayest; no, by no means. And if thou wilt,
I will give thee a proof of what I maintain, from the case of a kingdom, which is not of such
account with God as the priesthood. Saul, that son of Kish, was not himself at all ambitious
of becoming a king, but was going in quest of his asses, and came to ask the prophet about
them. The prophet, however, proceeded to speak to him of the kingdom, but not even then
did he run greedily after it, though he heard about it from a prophet, but drew back and
deprecated it, saying, “Who am I, and what is my father’s house.”129 What then? When he
made a bad use of the honor which had been given him by God, were those words of his
able to rescue him from the wrath of Him who had made him king? And was he able to say
to Samuel, when rebuked by him: “Did I greedily run and rush after the kingdom and sovereign
power? I wished to lead the undisturbed and peaceful life of ordinary men, but thou
didst drag me to this post of honor. Had I remained in my low estate I should easily have
escaped all these stumbling blocks, for were I one of the obscure multitude, I should never
have been sent forth on this expedition, nor would God have committed to my hands the
war against the Amalekites, and if I had not had it committed to me, I should not have
sinned this sin.” But all such arguments are weak as excuses, and not only weak, but perilous,
inasmuch as they rather kindle the wrath of God. For he who has been promoted to great
honor by God, must not advance the greatness of his honor as an excuse for his errors, but
should make God’s special favor towards him the motive for further improvement; whereas
he who thinks himself at liberty to sin because he has obtained some uncommon dignity,
what does he but study to show that the lovingkindness of God is the cause of his personal
transgression, which is always the argument of those who lead godless and careless lives.
But we ought to be on no account thus minded, nor to fall away into the insane folly of such
people, but be ambitious at all times to make the most of such powers as we have, and to be
reverent both in speech and thought.</p>
<p>For (to leave the kingdom and to come to the priesthood, which is the more immediate
subject of our discourse) neither was Eli ambitious of obtaining his high office, yet what
advantage was this to him when he sinned therein? But why do I say obtain it? not even had
he wished could he have avoided it, because he was under a legal necessity to accept it. For
he was of the tribe of Levi, and was bound to undertake that high office which descended
to him from his forefathers, notwithstanding which even he paid no small penalty for the
lawlessness130 of his sons. And the very first High Priest of the Jews,131 concerning whom

<pb n="88"/>
God spake so many words to Moses, when he was unable to withstand alone the frenzy of
so great a multitude, was he not very nearly being destroyed, but for the intercession of his
brother, which averted the wrath of God?132 And since we have mentioned Moses, it will
be well to show the truth of what we are saying from what happened to him. For this same
saintly Moses was so far from grasping at the leadership of the Jews as to deprecate the offer,
133 and to decline it when God commanded him to take it, and so to provoke the wrath
of Him who appointed him; and not only then, but afterwards when he entered upon his
rule, he would gladly have died to have been set free from it: “Kill me,” saith he, “if thou art
going to deal thus with me.”134 But what then? when he sinned at the waters of strife,135
could these repeated refusals be pleaded in excuse for him? Could they prevail with God to
grant him pardon? And wherefore was he deprived of the promised land? for no other
reason, as we all know, than for this sin of his, for which that wondrous man was debarred
from enjoying the same blessings which those over whom he ruled obtained; but after many
labors and sufferings, after that unspeakable wandering, after so many battles fought and
victories won, he died outside the land to reach which he had undergone so much toil and
trial; and though he had weathered the storms of the deep, he failed to enjoy the blessings
of the haven after all. From hence then thou seest that not only they who grasp at this office
are left without excuse for the sins they commit in the discharge thereof, but they too who
come to it through the ambitious desire of others; for truly if those persons who have been
chosen for this high office by God himself, though they have never so often refused it, have
paid such heavy penalties, and if nothing has availed to deliver any of them from this danger,
neither Aaron nor Eli, nor that holy man the Saint, the prophet, the wonder worker, the
meek above all the men which were upon the face of the earth,136 who spake with God, as
a man speaketh unto his friend,137 hardly shall we who fall so infinitely short of the excellence
of that great man, be able to plead as a sufficient excuse the consciousness that we have
never been ambitious of the dignity, more especially when many of the ordinations now-adays
do not proceed from the grace of God, but are due to human ambition. God chose Judas,
and counted him one of the sacred band, and committed to him, as to the rest, the dignity
of the apostolic office; yea he gave him somewhat beyond the others, the stewardship of the
money.138 But what of that? when he afterwards abused both these trusts, betraying Him

whom he was commissioned to preach, and misapplying the money which he should have
laid out well; did he escape punishment?139 nay for this very reason he even brought upon
himself greater punishment, and very reasonably too. For we must not use the high honors
given to us by God so as to offend Him, but so as to please Him better. But he who claims
exemption from punishment where it is due, because he has been exalted to higher honor
than others, acts very much like one of those unbelieving Jews, who after hearing Christ
say, “If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin,” “If I had not done
among them the works which none other did, they had not had sin,”140 should reproach
the Saviour and benefactor of mankind by replying, “Why, then, didst thou come and speak?
why didst thou work miracles? was it that thou mightest punish us the more?” But these are
the words of madness and of utter senselessness. For the Great Physician came not to give
thee over, but to heal thee—not to pass thee by when thou wert sick, but to rid thee entirely
of disease. But thou hast of thine own accord withdrawn thyself from his hands; receive
therefore the sorer punishment. For as thou wouldest have been freed from thy former
maladies if thou hadst yielded to his treatment, so if, when thou sawest him coming to thine
aid thou fleddest from him, thou wilt no longer be able to cleanse thyself of these infirmities,
and as thou art unable, thou wilt both suffer punishment for them, and also because for thy
part thou madest God’s solicitude for thy good of none effect. Therefore we who act like
this are not subjected to the same torment after as before we received honor at God’s hands,
but far severer torment after than before. For he who has not become good even by being
well treated, deserves all the bitterer punishment. Since, then, this excuse of thine has been
shown to be weak, and not only fails to save those who take refuge in it, but exposes them
so much the more, we must provide ourselves with some other means of safety.</p>
<p>Basil: Tell me of what nature is that? since, as for me, I am at present scarce master of
myself, thou hast reduced me to such a state of fear and trembling by what thou hast said.</p>
<p>Chrysostom: Do not, I beseech and implore thee, do not be so downcast. For while there
is safety for us who are weak, namely, in not undertaking this office at all, there is safety for
you too who are strong, and this consists in making your hopes of salvation depend, next
to the grace of God, on avoiding every act unworthy of this gift, and of God who gave it.
For they certainly would be deserving of the greatest punishment who, after obtaining this
dignity through their own ambition, should then either on account of sloth, or wickedness,
or even inexperience, abuse the office. Not that we are to gather from this that there is pardon
in store for those who have not been thus ambitious. Yea, even they too are deprived of all
excuse. For in my judgment, if ten thousand were to entreat and urge, a man should pay
them no attention, but should first of all search his own heart, and examine the whole matter
<note type="footnote">139 i.e., because he had been chosen an apostle.</note>

carefully before yielding to their importunities. Now no one would venture to undertake
the building of a house were he not an architect, nor will any one attempt the cure of sick
bodies who is not a skilled physician; but even though many urge him, will beg off, and will
not be ashamed to own his ignorance; and shall he who is going to have the care of so many
souls entrusted to him, not examine himself beforehand? will he accept this ministry even
though he be the most inexperienced of men, because this one commands him, or that man
constrains him, or for fear of offending a third? And if so, how will he escape casting himself
together with them into manifest misery. Had he continued as he was, it were possible for
him to be saved, but now he involves others in his own destruction. For whence can he hope
for salvation? whence to obtain pardon? Who will then successfully intercede for us? they
who are now perhaps urging us and forcibly dragging us on? But who will save these same
at such a moment? For even they too will stand in need in their turn of intercession, that
they may escape the fire. Now, that I say not these things to frighten thee, but as representing
the matter as in truth it is, hear what the holy Apostle Paul saith to Timothy his disciple,
his own and beloved son, “Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other
men’s sins.”141 Dost thou not see from what great blame, yea and vengeance, we, so far as
in us lies, have delivered those who were ready to put us forward for this office.</p>
<p>2. For as it is not enough for those who are chosen to say in excuse for themselves, “I
did not summon myself to this office, nor could I avoid what I did not see beforehand;” so
neither will it be a sufficient plea for those who ordain them to say that they did not know
him who was ordained. The charge against them becomes greater on account of their ignorance
of him whom they brought forward, and what seems to excuse them only serves to
accuse them the more. For how absurd a thing, is it not? that they who want to buy a slave,
show him to the physician, and require sureties for the sale, and information about him
from their neighbours, and after all this do not yet venture on his purchase without asking
for some time for a trial of him; while they who are going to admit any one to so great an
office as this, give their testimonial and their sanction loosely and carelessly, without further
investigation, just because some one wishes it, or to court the favor, or to avoid the displeasure
of some one else. Who shall then successfully intercede for us in that day, when they who
ought to defend us stand themselves in need of defenders? He who is going to ordain,
therefore, ought to make diligent inquiry, and much more he who is to be ordained. For
though they who ordain him share his punishment, for any sins which he may commit in
his office, yet so far from escaping vengeance he will even pay a greater penalty than
they—save only if they who chose him acted from some worldly motive contrary to what
seemed justifiable to themselves. For if they should be detected so doing, and knowing a
man to be unworthy have brought him forward on some pretext or other, the amount of
<note type="footnote">141 1 Tim. v. 22.</note>

<pb n="91"/>
their punishment shall be equivalent to his, nay perhaps the punishment shall be even
greater for them who appointed the unfit man. For he who gives authority to any one who
is minded to destroy the Church, would be certainly to blame for the outrages which that
person commits. But if he is guilty of no such thing, and says that he has been misled by the
opinions of others, even then he shall not altogether remain unpunished, but his punishment
shall be a little lighter than his who has been ordained. What then? It is possible that they
who elect may come to the election deceived by a false report. But he who is elected could
not say, “I am ignorant of myself,” as others were of him. As one who will receive therefore
a sorer punishment than they who put him forward, so should he make his scrutiny of
himself more careful than that which they make of him; and if they in ignorance drag him
on, he ought to come forward and instruct them carefully about any matters whereby he
may stop their being misled; and so having shown himself unworthy of trial may escape the
burden of so high an office.</p>
<p>For what is the reason why, in the arts of war, and merchandize,142 and husbandry, and
other departments of this life, when some plan is proposed, the husbandman will not undertake
to navigate the ship, nor the soldier to till the ground, nor the pilot to lead an army,
under pain of ten thousand deaths? Is it not plainly this? that each foresees the danger which
would attend his incompetence? Well, where the loss is concerned with trifles shall we use
so much forethought, and refuse to yield to the pressure of compulsion, but where the
punishment is eternal, as it is for those who know not how to handle the Priesthood, shall
we want only and inconsiderately run into so great danger, and then advance, as our excuse,
the pressing entreaties of others? But He who one day will judge us will entertain no such
plea as this. For we ought to show far more caution in spiritual matters than in carnal. But
now we are not found exhibiting as much caution. For tell me: if supposing a man to be an
artificer, when he is not so, we invited him to do a piece of work, and he were to respond
to the call, and then having set his hand to the material prepared for the building, were to
spoil the wood and spoil the stone, and so to build the house that it straightway fell to pieces,
would it be sufficient excuse for him to allege that he had been urged by others and did not
come of his own accord? in no wise; and very reasonably and justly so. For he ought to have
refused even at the call of others. So for the man who only spoils wood and stone, there will
be no escape from paying the penalty, and is he who destroys souls, and builds the temple
of God carelessly, to think that the compulsion of others is his warrant for escaping punishment?
Is not this very absurd? For I omit the fact as yet that no one is able to compel the
man who is unwilling. But be it that he was subjected to excessive pressure and divers artful
devices, and then fell into a snare; will this therefore rescue him from punishment? I beseech
thee, let us not deceive ourselves, and pretend that we know not what is obvious to a mere

child. For surely this pretence of ignorance will not be able to profit in the day of reckoning.
Thou wert not ambitious, thou sayest, of receiving this high office, conscious of thine own
weakness. Well and good. Then thou oughtest, with the same mind, to have declined the
solicitation of others; or, when no one called thee, wast thou weak and incapable, but when
those were found ready to offer thee this dignity, didst thou suddenly become competent?
What ludicrous nonsense! worthy of the extremest punishment. For this reason also the
Lord counsels the man who wishes to build a tower, not to lay the foundation before he has
taken his own ability to build into account, lest he should give the passers by innumerable
opportunities of mocking at him.143 But in his case the penalty only consists in becoming
a laughing-stock; while in that before us the punishment is that of fire unquenchable, and
of an undying worm,144 gnashing of teeth, outer darkness, and being cut asunder,145 and
having a portion with the hypocrites.</p>
<p>But my accusers are unwilling to consider any of these things. For otherwise they would
cease to blame a person who is unwilling to perish without cause. It is not the management
of corn and barley, oxen or sheep, that is now under our consideration, nor any such like
matters, but the very Body of Jesus. For the Church of Christ, according to St. Paul, is Christ’s
Body,146 and he who is entrusted with its care ought to train it up to a state of healthiness,
and beauty unspeakable, and to look everywhere, lest any spot or wrinkle,147 or other like
blemish should mar its vigor and comeliness. For what is this but to make it appear worthy,
so far as human power can, of the incorruptible and ever-blessed Head which is set over it?
If they who are ambitious of reaching an athletic condition of body need the help of physicians
and trainers,148 and exact diet, and constant exercise, and a thousand other rules (for
the omission of the merest trifle upsets and spoils the whole), how shall they to whose lot
falls the care of the body, which has its conflict not against flesh and blood, but against
powers unseen, be able to keep it sound and healthy, unless they far surpass ordinary human
virtue, and are versed in all healing proper for the soul?</p>
<p>3. Pray, art thou not aware that that body is subject to more diseases and assaults than
this flesh of ours, is more quickly corrupted, and more slow to recover? and by those who
have the healing of these bodies, divers medicines have been discovered, and an apparatus
of different instruments, and diet suitable for the sick; and often the condition of the atmo-

sphere is of itself enough for the recovery of a sick man; and there are instances of seasonable
sleep having saved the physician all further labor. But in the case before us, it is impossible
to take any of these things into consideration; nay there is but one method and way of
healing appointed, after we have gone wrong, and that is, the powerful application of the
Word. This is the one instrument, the only diet, the finest atmosphere. This takes the place
of physic, cautery and cutting, and if it be needful to sear and amputate, this is the means
which we must use, and if this be of no avail, all else is wasted; with this we both rouse the
soul when it sleeps, and reduce it when it is inflamed; with this we cut off excesses, and fill
up defects, and perform all manner of other operations which are requisite for the soul’s
health. Now as regards the ordering of our daily life for the best, it is true that the life of
another may provoke us to emulation. But in the matter of spurious doctrine, when any
soul is diseased thereby, then there is great need of the Word, not only in view of the safety
of our own people, but in view of the enemy without. If, indeed, one had the sword of the
spirit, and the shield of faith,149 so as to be able to work miracles, and by means of these
marvels to stop the mouths of impudent gainsayers, one would have little need of the assistance
of the Word; still in the days of miracles the Word was by no means useless, but essentially
necessary. For St. Paul made use of it himself, although he was everywhere so great an
object of wonder for his miracles; and another150 of those who belonged to the “glorious
company of the Apostles” exhorts us to apply ourselves to acquiring this power, when he
says: “Be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning
the hope that is in you,” and they all, with one accord, committed the care of the poor widows
to Stephen, for no other reason than that they themselves might have leisure “for the ministry
of the Word.”151 To this we ought equally to apply ourselves, unless indeed we are endued
with a power of working miracles. But if there is not the least sign of such a power being
left us, while on every side many enemies are constantly attacking us, why then it necessarily
follows that we should arm ourselves with this weapon, both in order that we may not be
wounded ourselves with the darts of the enemy, and in order that we may wound him.</p>
<p>4. Wherefore it should be our ambition that the Word of Christ dwell in us richly.152
For it is not for one kind of battle only that we have to be prepared. This warfare is manifold,
and is engaged with a great variety of enemies; neither do all these use the same weapons,
nor do they practice the same method of attack; and he who has to join battle with all, must
needs know the artifices of all, and be at once both archer and slinger, captain and general,

in the ranks and in command, on foot and on horseback, in sea-fight and in siege. In common
warfare, indeed, each man repels the enemy by discharging the particular duty which he
has undertaken. But here it is otherwise; and if any one wishes to come off conqueror in
this warfare, he must understand all forms of the art, as the devil knows well how to introduce
his own assailants through any one spot which may happen to be unguarded, and to carry
off the sheep. But not so where he perceives the shepherd coming equipped with accurate
knowledge at all points, and well acquainted with his plottings. Wherefore we ought to be
well-guarded in all parts: for a city, so long as it happens to be surrounded with a wall, laughs
to scorn the besiegers, abiding in great security; but if any one makes a breach in the wall,
though but of the size of a gate, the rest of the circuit is of no use, although the whole of it
stand quite securely; so it is with the city of God: so long as the presence of mind and wisdom
of the shepherd, which answers to the wall, protect it on all sides, all the enemy’s devices
end in his confusion and ridicule, and they who dwell within the wall abide unmolested,
but wherever any one has been able to demolish a single part, though the rest stand never
so fast, through that breach ruin will enter upon the whole. For to what purpose does a man
contend earnestly with the Greeks, if at the same time he becomes a prey to the Jews? or get
the better of both these and then fall into the clutches of the Manichæans?153 or after he
has proved himself superior to them even, if they who introduce fatalism154 enter in, and
make havoc of the flock? But not to enumerate all the heresies of the devil, it will be enough
to say that unless the shepherd is well skilled in refuting them all, the wolf, by means of any
one of them, can enter, and devour the greater part of the flock. In ordinary warfare we
must always look for victory being won or defeat sustained by the soldiers who are on the
field of battle. But in the spiritual warfare the case is quite different. For there it often happens
that the combat with one set of enemies secures a victory for others who never engaged in
battle at all, nor took any trouble, but were sitting still all the while; and he who has not
much experience in such occurrences will get pierced, so to say, with his own sword, and
become the laughing-stock of friends and foes alike. I will try by an example to make clear
what I am saying. They who receive the wild doctrines of Valentinus and Marcion,155 and
<note type="footnote">153 The followers of Manes, or Manichæus, who was born about 240 A.D. He taught that God was the cause
of good, and matter the cause of evil. This theory about matter led him to hold that the body of Jesus was an
incorporeal phantom. He eliminated the Old Testament from the Scriptures, and held himself at liberty also to
reject such passages in the New Testament as were opposed to his own opinions. See Robertson: Hist. of the
Christian Church, vol. i. 139–145.</note>

of all whose minds are similarly diseased, exclude the Law given by God to Moses from the
catalogue of the Divine Scriptures. But Jews so revere the Law, that although the time has
come which annuls it, they still contend for the observance of all its contents, contrary to
the purpose of God. But the Church of God, avoiding either extreme, has trodden a middle
path, and is neither induced on the one hand to place herself under its yoke, nor on the
other does she tolerate its being slandered, but commends it, though its day is over, because
of its profitableness while its season lasted. Now it is necessary for him who is going to fight
with both these enemies,156 to be fully conversant with this middle course. For if in wishing
to teach the Jews that they are out of date in clinging to the old law, he begins to find fault
with it unsparingly, he gives no little handle to those heretics who wish to pull it to pieces;
and if in his ambition to stop their mouths he extols it immoderately, and speaks of it with
admiration, as necessary for this present time, he unseals the lips of the Jews. Again they
who labor under the frenzy of Sabellius and the craze of Arius,157 have both fallen from a
sound faith for want of observing a middle course. The name of Christian is applied to both
these heretics; but if any one examines their doctrines, he will find the one sect not much
better than the Jews, and differing from them only in name, and the other158 very nearly
holding the heresy of Paul of Samosata,159 and that both are very wide of the truth. Great,
therefore, is the danger in such cases, and the way of orthodoxy is narrow and hemmed in
by threatening crags on either side, and there is no little fear lest when intending to strike
at one enemy we should be wounded by the other. For if any one assert the unity of the
Godhead, Sabellius straightway turns that expression to the advantage of his own mental
<note type="footnote">religious than theological. The sect of the Valentinians lasted as late as the 5th century; and Marcionism was
not extinct till the 6th.</note>

<note type="footnote">157 Sabellius was condemned in a Council held in Rome, A.D. 263, for holding that there is but one person
in the Godhead, and that the Word and Holy Spirit are only virtues or emanations of the Deity. Arius held that
our Lord Jesus Christ existed before His Incarnation, that by Him as by an instrument the Supreme God made
the worlds, and that as being the most ancient and the highest of created beings, He is to be worshipped; but
that He had a beginning of existence, and so is not God’s co-eternally begotten Son, nor of the very substance
of the Supreme God. See Liddon, Bampton Lectures, i. p. 25. The heresy of Arius was condemned at the Council

vagary,160 and if he distinguish the Persons, and say that the Father is one, and the Son another,
and the Holy Spirit a third, up gets Arius, ready to wrest that distinction of Persons
into a difference of substance;161 so we must turn and flee both from the impious confounding
of the Persons by the one, and the senseless division of the substance by the other, confessing,
indeed, that the Godhead of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, is all
one, while we add thereunto a Trinity of Persons. For then we shall be able to fortify ourselves
against the attacks of both heretics. I might tell thee besides these, of several other adversaries
against which, except we contend bravely and carefully, we shall leave the field covered with
wounds.</p>
<p>5. Why should any one describe the silly chatter of our own people? For these are not
less than the attacks upon us from without, while they give the teacher even more trouble.
Some out of an idle curiosity are rashly bent upon busying themselves about matters which
are neither possible for them to know, nor of any advantage to them if they could know
them. Others again demand from God an account of his judgments, and force themselves
to sound the depth of that abyss which is unfathomable. “For thy judgments,” saith the
Scriptures, “are a great deep,”162 and about their faith and practice thou wouldest find few
of them anxious, but the majority curiously inquiring into matters which it is not possible
to discover, and the mere inquiry into which provokes God. For when we make a determined
effort to learn what He does not wish us to know, we fail to succeed (for how should we
succeed against the will of God?); and there only remains for us the danger arising from our
inquiry. Now, though this be the case, whenever any one authoritatively stops the search,
into such fathomless depths, he gets himself the reputation of being proud and ignorant; so
that at such times much tact is needed on the Bishop’s part, so as to lead his people away
from these unprofitable questions, and himself escape the above-named censures. In short,
to meet all these difficulties, there is no help given but that of speech, and if any be destitute
of this power, the souls of those who are put under his charge (I mean of the weaker and
more meddlesome kind) are no better off than ships continually storm-tossed. So that the
Priest should do all that in him lies, to gain this means of strength.</p>

makes no secret of his poverty of speech, but distinctly confesses himself to be unskilled,

<p>Chrysostom: This is the very thing which has ruined many and made them remiss in
the study of true doctrine. For while they failed to fathom the depths of the apostle’s mind,
and to understand the meaning of his words, they passed all their time slumbering and
yawning, and paying respect not to that ignorance which St. Paul acknowledges, but to a
kind from which he was as free as any man ever was in the world.</p>
<p>But leaving this subject to await our consideration, I say this much in the meantime.
Granting that St. Paul was in this respect as unskilled as they would have him to be, what
has that to do with the men of to-day? For he had a greater power by far than power of
speech, power which brought about greater results too; which was that his bare presence,
even though he was silent, was terrible to the demons. But the men of the present day, if
they were all collected in one place, would not be able, with infinite prayers and tears, to do
the wonders that once were done by the handkerchief of St. Paul. He too by his prayers
raised the dead,164 and wrought such other miracles, that he was held to be a god by heathen;
165 and before he was removed from this life, he was thought worthy to be caught up
as far as the third heaven, and to share in such converse as it is not lawful for mortal ears to
hear.166 But the men of to-day—not that I would say anything harsh or severe, for indeed
I do not speak by way of insult to them, but only in wonder—how is it that they do not
shudder when they measure themselves with so great a man as this? For if we leave the
miracles and turn to the life of this blessed saint, and look into his angelic conversation, it
is in this rather than in his miracles that thou wilt find this Christian athlete a conqueror.
For how can one describe his zeal and forbearance, his constant perils, his continual cares,
and incessant anxiety for the Churches; his sympathy with the weak, his many afflictions,
his unwonted persecutions, his deaths daily? Where is the spot in the world, where is the
continent or sea, that is a stranger to the labours of this righteous man? Even the desert has
known his presence, for it often sheltered him in time of danger. For he underwent every
species of attack, and achieved every kind of victory, and there was never any end to his
contests and his triumphs.</p>
<p>Yet, all unawares, I have been led to do this man an injury. For his exploits are beyond
all powers of description, and beyond mine in particular, just as the masters of eloquence
surpass me. Nevertheless, since that holy apostle will judge us, not by the issue, but by the
motive, I shall not forbear till I have stated one more circumstance which surpasses anything
yet mentioned, as much as he himself surpasses all his fellow men. And what is this? After
so many exploits, after such a multitude of victories, he prayed that he might go into hell,
and be handed over to eternal punishment, if so be that those Jews, who had often stoned

<pb n="98"/>
him, and done what they could to make away with him, might be saved, and come over to
Christ.167 Now who so longed for Christ? If, indeed, his feelings towards him ought not to
be described as something nobler than longing; shall we then any more compare ourselves
with this saint, after so great grace was imparted to him from above, after so great virtue
was manifested in himself? What could be more presumptuous?</p>
<p>Now, that he was not so unskilled, as some count him to be, I shall try to show in what
follows. The unskilled person in men’s estimation is not only one who is unpracticed in the
tricks of profane oratory,168 but the man who is incapable of contending for the defence of
the right faith, and they are right. But St. Paul did not say that he was unskilled in both these
respects, but in one only; and in support of this he makes a careful distinction, saying that
he was “rude in speech, but not in knowledge.”169 Now were I to insist upon the polish of
Isocrates, the weight of Demosthenes, the dignity of Thucydides, and the sublimity of Plato,
in any one bishop, St. Paul would be a strong evidence against me. But I pass by all such
matters and the elaborate ornaments of profane oratory; and I take no account of style or
of delivery; yea let a man’s diction be poor and his composition simple and unadorned, but
let him not be unskilled in the knowledge and accurate statement of doctrine; nor in order
to screen his own sloth, deprive that holy apostle of the greatest of his gifts, and the sum of
his praises.</p>
<p>7. For how was it, tell me, that he confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus,170
though he had not yet begun to work miracles? How was it that he wrestled with the Grecians
and threw them?171 and why was he sent to Tarsus? Was it not because he was so mighty
and victorious in the word, and brought his adversaries to such a pass that they, unable to
brook their defeat, were provoked to seek his life? At that time, as I said, he had not begun
to work miracles, nor could any one say that the masses looked upon him with astonishment
on account of any glory belonging to his mighty works, or that they who contended with
him were overpowered by the force of public opinion concerning him. For at this time he
conquered by dint of argument only. How was it, moreover, that he contended and disputed
successfully with those who tried to Judaize in Antioch? and how was it that that Areopagite,
172 an inhabitant of Athens, that most devoted of all cities to the gods, followed the

apostle, he and his wife? was it not owing to the discourse which they heard? And when
Eutychus173 fell from the lattice, was it not owing to his long attendance even until midnight
to St. Paul’s preaching? How do we find him employed at Thessalonica and Corinth, in
Ephesus and in Rome itself? Did he not spend whole nights and days in interpreting the
Scriptures in their order? and why should any one recount his disputes with the Epicureans
and Stoics.174 For were we resolved to enter into every particular, our story would grow to
an unreasonable length.</p>
<p>When, therefore, both before working miracles, and after, St. Paul appears to have made
much use of argument, how can any one dare to pronounce him unskillful whose sermons
and disputations were so exceedingly admired by all who heard them? Why did the Lycaonians175
imagine that he was Hermes? The opinion that he and Barnabas were gods indeed,
arose out of the sight of their miracles; but the notion that he was Hermes did not arise from
this, but was a consequence of his speech. In what else did this blessed saint excel the rest
of the apostles? and how comes it that up and down the world he is so much on every one’s
tongue? How comes it that not merely among ourselves, but also among Jews and Greeks,
he is the wonder of wonders? Is it not from the power of his epistles? whereby not only to
the faithful of to-day, but from his time to this, yea and up to the end, even the appearing
of Christ, he has been and will be profitable, and will continue to be so as long as the human
race shall last. For as a wall built of adamant, so his writings fortify all the Churches of the
known world, and he as a most noble champion stands in the midst, bringing into captivity
every thought to the obedience of Christ, casting down imaginations, and every high thing
which exalts itself against the knowledge of God,176 and all this he does by those epistles
which he has left to us full of wonders and of Divine wisdom. For his writings are not only
useful to us, for the overthrow of false doctrine and the confirmation of the true, but they
help not a little towards living a good life. For by the use of these, the bishops of the present
day fit and fashion the chaste virgin, which St. Paul himself espoused to Christ,177 and
conduct her to the state of spiritual beauty; with these, too, they drive away from her the
noisome pestilences which beset her, and preserve the good health thus obtained. Such are
the medicines and such their efficacy left us by this so-called unskillful man, and they know
them and their power best who constantly use them. From all this it is evident that St. Paul
had given himself to the study of which we have been speaking with great diligence and zeal.</p>

<p>8. Hear also what he says in his charge to his disciple:178 “Give heed to reading, to exhortation,
to teaching,” and he goes on to show the usefulness of this by adding, “For in
doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee.”179 And again he says, “The
Lord’s servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing;”180 and
he proceeds to say, “But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned, and hast been
assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them, and that from a babe thou hast known
the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation,”181 and again, “Every
Scripture is inspired of God, and also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for
instruction which is in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete.”182 Hear what
he adds further in his directions to Titus about the appointment of bishops. “The bishop,”
he says, “must be holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he
may be able to convict the gainsayers.”183 But how shall any one who is unskillful as these
men pretend, be able to convict the gainsayers and stop their mouths? or what need is there
to give attention to reading and to the Holy Scriptures, if such a state of unskillfulness is to
be welcome among us? Such arguments are mere makeshifts and pretexts, the marks of
idleness and sloth. But some one will say, “it is to the priests that these charges are given:”—
certainly, for they are the subjects of our discourse. But that the apostle gives the same
charge to the laity, hear what he says in another epistle to other than the priesthood: “Let
the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom,”184 and again, “Let your speech be always
with grace seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer each one,”185 and
there is a general charge to all that they “be ready to”186 render an account of their faith,
and to the Thessalonians, he gives the following command: “Build each other up, even as
also ye do.”187 But when he speaks of priests he says, “Let the elders that rule well be counted
worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word, and in teaching.”188 For
this is the perfection of teaching when the teachers both by what they do, and by what they

say as well, bring their disciples to that blessed state of life which Christ appointed for them.
For example alone is not enough to instruct others. Nor do I say this of myself; it is our Saviour’s
own word. “For whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great.189 Now
if doing were the same as teaching, the second word here would be superfluous; and it had
been enough to have said “whosoever shall do” simply. But now by distinguishing the two,
he shows that practice is one thing, and doctrine another, and that each needs the help of
the others in order to complete edification. Thou hearest too what the chosen vessel of Christ
says to the Ephesian elders: “Wherefore watch ye, remembering that for the space of three
years, I ceased not to admonish every one, night and day, with tears.”190 But what need was
there for his tears or for admonition by word of mouth, while his life as an apostle was so
illustrious? His holy life might be a great inducement to men to keep the commandments,
yet I dare not say that it alone could accomplish everything.</p>
<p>9. But when a dispute arises concerning matters of doctrine, and all take their weapons
from the same Scriptures, of what weight will any one’s life be able to prove? What then will
be the good of his many austerities, when after such painful exercises, any one from the
Priest’s great unskillfulness in argument fall into heresy, and be cut off from the body of the
Church, a misfortune which I have myself seen many suffering. Of what profit then will his
patience be to him? None; no more than there will be in a sound faith if the life is corrupt.
Wherefore, for this reason more than for all others, it concerns him whose office it is to
teach others, to be experienced in disputations of this kind. For though he himself stands
safely, and is unhurt by the gainsayers, yet the simple multitude under his direction, when
they see their leader defeated, and without any answer for the gainsayers, will be apt to lay
the blame of his discomfiture not on his own weakness, but on the doctrines themselves, as
though they were faulty; and so by reason of the inexperience of one, great numbers are
brought to extreme ruin; for though they do not entirely go over to the adversary, yet they
are forced to doubt about matters in which formerly they firmly believed, and those whom
they used to approach with unswerving confidence, they are unable to hold to any longer
steadfastly, but in consequence of their leader’s defeat, so great a storm settles down upon
their souls, that the mischief ends in their shipwreck altogether. But how dire is the destruction,
and how terrible the fire which such a leader brings upon his own wretched head for
every soul which is thus lost, thou wilt not need to learn from me, as thou knowest all this
perfectly. Is this then pride, is this vainglory in me, to be unwilling to be the cause of the
destruction of so many souls? and of procuring for myself greater punishment in the world
to come, than that which now awaits me there? Who would say so? surely no one, unless
he should wish to find fault where there is none, and to moralize over other men’s calamities.</p>

<p>1. How great is the skill required for the teacher in contending earnestly for the truth,
has been sufficiently set forth by us. But I have to mention one more matter beside this,
which is a cause of numberless dangers, though for my own part I should rather say that
the thing itself is not the cause, but they who know not how to use it rightly, since it is of
itself a help to salvation and to much good besides, whenever thou findest that earnest and
good men have the management of it. What then, do I mean by this? The expenditure of
great labor upon the preparation of discourses to be delivered in public. For to begin with,
the majority of those who are under the preachers’ charge are not minded to behave towards
them as towards teachers, but disdaining the part of learners, they assume instead the attitude
of those who sit and look on at the public games; and just as the multitude there is separated
into parties, and some attach themselves to one, and some to another, so here also men are
divided, and become the partisans now of this teacher, now of that, listening to them with
a view to favor or spite. And not only is there this hardship, but another quite as great. For
if it has occurred to any preacher to weave into his sermons any part of other men’s works,
he is exposed to greater disgrace than those who steal money. Nay, often where he has not
even borrowed anything from any one, but is only suspected, he has suffered the fate of a
thief. And why do I speak of the works of others when it is not permitted to him to use his
own resources without variety? For the public are accustomed to listen not for profit, but
for pleasure, sitting like critics of tragedies, and of musical entertainments, and that facility
of speech against which we declaimed just now, in this case becomes desirable, even more
than in the case of barristers, where they are obliged to contend one against the other. A
preacher then should have loftiness of mind, far exceeding my own littleness of spirit, that
he may correct this disorderly and unprofitable pleasure on the part of the multitude, and
be able to lead them over to a more useful way of hearing, that his people may follow and
yield to him, and that he may not be led away by their own humors, and this it is not possible
to arrive at, except by two means: indifference to their praise, and the power of preaching
well.191</p>
<p>2. For if either of these be lacking, the remaining one becomes useless, owing to its divorce
from the other, for if a preacher be indifferent to praise, and yet cannot produce the
doctrine “which is with grace seasoned with salt,”192 he becomes despised by the multitude,
while he gains nothing from his own nobleness of mind; and if on the other hand he is
successful as a preacher, and is overcome by the thought of applause, harm is equally done
in turn, both to himself and the multitude, because in his desire for praise he is careful to
<note type="footnote">191 Chrysostom’s own sermons were often interrupted by applause, which he always severely reprimanded.</note>
<note type="footnote">192 Col. iv. 6.</note>

<pb n="103"/>
speak rather with a view to please than to profit. And as he who neither lets good opinion
influence him, nor is skillful in speaking, does not yield to the pleasure of the multitude,
and is unable to do them any good worth mentioning, because he has nothing to say, so he
who is carried away with desire for praise, though he is able to render the multitude better
service, rather provides in place of this such food as will suit their taste, because he purchases
thereby the tumult of acclamation.</p>
<p>3. The best kind of Bishop must, therefore, be strong in both these points, so that neither
may supplant the other. For if when he stands up in the congregation and speaks words
calculated to make the careless wince,193 he then stumbles, and stops short, and is forced
to blush at his failure, the good of what he has spoken is immediately wasted. For they who
are rebuked, being galled by what has been told them, and unable to avenge themselves on
him otherwise, taunt him, with jeers at this ignorance of his, thinking to screen their own
reproach thereby. Wherefore he ought, like some very good charioteer, to come to an accurate
judgment about both these good things, in order that he may be able to deal with both as
he may have need; for when he is irreproachable in the eyes of all, then he will be able, with
just so much authority as he wishes, both to correct and to remit from correction all those
who are under his rule. But without this it will not be easy for him to do so. But this nobleness
of soul should be shown not only up to the limit of indifference to praise, but should go
further in order that the gain thus gotten may not in its turn be fruitless.</p>
<p>4. To what else ought he then to be indifferent? Slander and envy. Unseasonable evil
speaking,194 however (for of course the Bishop undergoes some groundless censure), it is
well that he should neither fear nor tremble at excessively, nor entirely pass over; but we
ought, though it happen to be false, or to be brought against us by the common herd, to try
and extinguish it immediately. For nothing so magnifies both an evil and a good report as
the undisciplined mob. For accustomed to hear and to speak without stopping to make inquiry,
they repeat at random everything which comes in their way, without any regard to
the truth of it. Therefore the Bishop ought not to be unconcerned about the multitude, but
straightway to nip their evil surmisings in the bud; persuading his accusers, even if they be
the most unreasonable of all men, and to omit nothing which is able to dispel an ill-favored
report. But if, when we do all this, they who blame us will not be persuaded, thenceforward
we should give them no concern. Since if any one be too quick to be dejected by these accidents,
he will not be able at any time to produce anything noble and admirable. For despondency
and constant cares are mighty for destroying the powers of the mind, and for reducing
it to extreme weakness. Thus then must the Priest behave towards those in his charge, as a
father would behave to his very young children; and as such are not disturbed either by their
<note type="footnote">193 ἐπιστύψαι, literally, to purse up the mouth, as at the taste of what is tart or sour.</note>
<note type="footnote">194 κακηγορία—if κατηγορία be read, “accusation” will be the meaning.</note>

<pb n="104"/>
insults or their blows, or their lamentations, nor even if they laugh and rejoice with us, do
we take much account of it; so should we neither be puffed up by the promises of these
persons nor cast down at their censure, when it comes from them unseasonably. But this is
hard, my good friend; and perhaps, methinks, even impossible. For I know not whether any
man ever succeeded in the effort not to be pleased when he is praised, and the man who is
pleased at this is likely also to desire to enjoy it, and the man who desires to enjoy it will, of
necessity, be altogether vexed and beside himself whenever he misses it. For as they who
revel in being rich, when they fall into poverty are grieved, and they who have been used to
live luxuriously cannot bear to live shabbily; so, too, they who long for applause, not only
when they are blamed without a cause, but when they are not constantly being praised, become,
as by some famine, wasted in soul, particularly when they happen themselves to have
been used to praise, or if they hear others being praised. He who enters upon the trial of
preaching with desires of this kind, how many annoyances and how many pangs dost thou
think that he has? It is no more possible for the sea to be without waves than that man to
be without cares and grief.</p>
<p>5. For though the preacher may have great ability (and this one would only find in a
few), not even in this case is he released from perpetual toil. For since preaching does not
come by nature, but by study, suppose a man to reach a high standard of it, this will then
forsake him if he does not cultivate his power by constant application and exercise. So that
there is greater labor for the wiser than for the unlearned. For there is not the same degree
of loss attending negligence on the part of the one and the other, but the loss is in exact
proportion to the difference between the two possessions. For the latter195 no one would
blame, as they furnish nothing worth regarding. But the former, unless they are constantly
producing matter beyond the reputation in which all hold them, great censure attends on
all hands; and besides these things, the latter would meet with considerable praise, even for
small performances, while the efforts of the former, unless they be specially wonderful and
startling, not only fail to win applause, but meet with many fault-finders. For the audience
set themselves to be critics, not so much in judgment of what is said as of the reputation of
the speaker, so that whenever any one excels all others in oratorical powers, then especially
of all others does he need laborious study. For this man is not allowed to avail himself of
the usual plea which human nature urges, that one cannot succeed in everything; but if his
sermons do not throughout correspond to the greatness of the expectations formed, he will
go away without having gained anything but countless jeers and censures; and no one takes
this into consideration about him, that dejection and pain, and anxiety, and often anger,
may step in, and dim the clearness of his thoughts and prevent his productions from coming
from him unalloyed,196 and that on the whole, being but a man, he cannot be constantly
<note type="footnote">195 Sc. The unlearned.</note>
<note type="footnote">196 εἰλικρινῆ—literally, so that the sunlight fails to discern a flaw in them.</note>

<pb n="105"/>
the same, nor at all times acquit himself successfully, but naturally must sometimes fall short
of the mark, and appear on a lower level of ability than usual. None of these things, as I said,
are they willing to take into consideration, but charge him with faults as if they were sitting
in judgment on an angel; though in other cases, too, a man is apt to overlook the good performances
of his neighbor, though they be many and great, and if anywhere a defect appears,
even if it be accidental, even if it only occur at long intervals, it is quickly perceived, and always
remembered, and thus small and trifling matters have often lessened the glory of many
and great doings.</p>
<p>6. Thou seest, my excellent friend, that the man who is powerful in preaching has peculiar
need of greater study than others; and besides study, of forbearance also greater than
what is needed by all those whom I have already mentioned. For thus are many constantly
springing up against him, in a vain and senseless spirit, and having no fault to find with
him, but that he is generally approved of, hate him; and he must bear their bitter malice
nobly, for as they are not able to hide this cursed hatred, which they so unreasonably entertain,
they both revile, and censure, and slander in private, and defame in public, and the
mind which has begun to be pained and exasperated, on every one of these occasions, will
not escape being corrupted by grief. For they will not only revenge themselves upon him
by their own acts, but will try to do so by means of others, and often having chosen some
one of those who are unable to speak a word, will extol him with their praises and admire
him beyond his worth. Some do this through ignorance alone,197 some through ignorance
and envy, in order that they may ruin the reputation of the other, not that they may prove
the man to be wonderful who is not so, and the noble-minded man has not only to struggle
against these, but often against the ignorance of the whole multitude; for since it is not
possible that all those who come together should consist of learned men, but the chances
are that the larger part of the congregation is composed of unlearned people, and that even
the rest, who are clearer headed than they, fall as far short of being able to criticize sermons
as the remainder again fall short of them; so that only one or two are seated there who possess
this power; it follows, of necessity, that he who preaches better than others carries away less
applause, and possibly goes home without being praised at all, and he must be prepared to
meet such anomalies nobly, and to pardon those who commit them in ignorance, and to
weep for those who acquiesce in them on account of envy as wretched and pitiable creatures,
and not to consider that his powers have become less on either of these accounts. For if a
man, being a pre-eminently good painter, and superior to all in his art, sees the portrait
which he has drawn with great accuracy held up to ridicule, he ought not to be dejected,
and to consider the picture poor, because of the judgment of the ignorant; as he would not
<note type="footnote">197 Another reading is μανί‹, infatuation.</note>

<pb n="106"/>
consider the drawing that is really poor to be something wonderful and lovely, because of
the astonishment of the inartistic.</p>
<p>7. For let the best artificer be himself the critic of his own designs, and let his performances
be determined to be good or poor, according as the mind which designed them gives
sentence upon them. But let him not even consider the opinion, so erroneous and inartistic,
of the outside world. Let, therefore, the man who undertakes the strain of teaching never
give heed to the good opinion of the outside world, nor be dejected in soul on account of
such persons; but laboring at his sermons so that he may please God, (For let this alone be
his rule and determination, in discharging this best kind of workmanship, not acclamation,
nor good opinions,) if, indeed, he be praised by men, let him not repudiate their applause,
and when his hearers do not offer this, let him not seek it, let him not be grieved. For a sufficient
consolation in his labors, and one greater than all, is when he is able to be conscious
of arranging and ordering his teaching with a view to pleasing God.</p>
<p>8. For if he be first carried away with the desire for indiscriminate praise, he will reap
no advantage from his labors, or from his power in preaching, for the mind being unable
to bear the senseless censures of the multitude is dispirited, and casts aside all earnestness
about preaching. Therefore it is especially necessary to be trained to be indifferent to all
kinds of praise. For to know how to preach is not enough for the preservation of that power,
if this be not added: and if any one would examine accurately the man who is destitute of
this art, he will find that he needs to be indifferent to praise no less than the other,198 for
he will be forced to do many wrong things in placing himself under the control of popular
opinion. For not having the energy to equal those who are in repute for the quality of their
preaching, he will not refrain from forming ill designs against them, from envying them,
and from blaming them without reason, and from many such discreditable practices, but
will venture everything, even if it be needful to ruin his own soul, for the sake of bringing
down their fame to the level of his own insignificance. And in addition to this, he will leave
off his exertions about his work; a kind of numbness, as it were, spreading itself over his
mind. For much toil, rewarded by scanty praise, is sufficient to cast down a man who cannot
despise praise, and put him into a deep lethargy, since the husbandman even when he spends
time over some sorry piece of land, and is forced to till a rock, quickly desists from his work,
unless he is possessed of much earnestness about the matter, or has a fear of famine impending
over him. For if they who are able to speak with considerable power, need such constant
exercise for the preservation of their talent, he who collects no materials at all, but is forced
in the midst of his efforts to meditate; what difficulty, what confusion, what trouble will he
experience, in order that he may be able at great labor to collect a few ideas! and if any of
those clergy who are under his authority, and who are placed in the inferior order, be able
<note type="footnote">198 i.e., The skillful preacher.</note>

<pb n="107"/>
in that position to appear to better advantage than he; what a divine mind must he have, so
as not to be seized with envy or cast down by despondency. For, for one to be placed in a
station of higher dignity, and to be surpassed by his inferior in rank, and to bear this nobly,
would not be the part of any ordinary mind, nor of such as my own, but of one as hard as
adamant; and if, indeed, the man who is in greater repute be very forbearing and modest,
the suffering becomes so much the more easily borne. But if he is bold and boastful and
vainglorious, a daily death would be desirable for the other; he will so embitter his life, insulting
him to his face, and laughing at him behind his back, wresting much of his authority
from him, and wishing to be everything himself. But he is possessed of the greatest security,
in all these circumstances, who has fluency in preaching, and the earnest attention of the
multitude about him, and the affection of all those who are under his charge. Dost not thou
know what a passion for sermons has burst in upon the minds of Christians now-a-days?
and that they who practice themselves in preaching are in especial honor, not only among
the heathen, but among them of the household of the faith? How then could any one bear
such disgrace as to find that all are mute when he is preaching, and think that they are oppressed,
and wait for the end of the sermon, as for some release from work; while they listen
to another with eagerness though he preach long, and are sorry when he is about to conclude;
and almost angry when it is his purpose to be silent. If these matters seem to thee to be small,
and easily to be despised, it is because of thine inexperience. They are truly enough to quench
zeal, and to paralyze the powers of the mind, unless a man withdraw himself from all human
passions, and study to frame his conduct after the pattern of those incorporeal powers, who
are neither pursued by envy, nor by longing for fame, nor by any other morbid feeling. If
then there be any man so constituted as to be able to subdue this wild beast, so difficult to
capture, so unconquerable, so fierce; that is to say, public fame, and to cut off its many heads,
or rather to forbid their growth altogether; he will easily be able to repel these many violent
assaults, and to enjoy a kind of quiet haven of rest. But he who has not freed himself from
this monster, involves his soul in struggles of various kinds, and perpetual agitation, and
the burden both of despondency and of other passions. But why need I detail the rest of
these difficulties, which no one will be able to describe, or to learn unless he has had actual
experience of them.</p>

<p>1. Our condition here, indeed, is such as thou hast heard. But our condition hereafter
how shall we endure, when we are compelled to give our account for each of those who have
been entrusted to us? For our penalty is not limited to shame, but everlasting chastisement
awaits us as well. As for the passage, “Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit
to them, for they watch in behalf of your souls as they that shall give account;”199 though I
have mentioned it once already, yet I will break silence about it now, for the fear of its
warning is continually agitating my soul. For if for him who causes one only, and that the
least, to stumble, it is profitable that “a great millstone should be hanged about his neck,
and that he should be sunk in the depth of the sea;”200 and if they who wound the consciences
of the brethren, sin against Christ Himself,201 what then will they one day suffer, what kind
of penalty will they pay, who destroy not one only, or two, or three, but so many multitudes?
For it is not possible for inexperience to be urged as an excuse, nor to take refuge in ignorance,
nor for the plea of necessity or force to be put forward. Yea, if it were possible, one of those
under their charge could more easily make use of this refuge for his own sins than bishops
in the case of the sins of others. Dost thou ask why? Because he who has been appointed to
rectify the ignorance of others, and to warn them beforehand of the conflict with the devil
which is coming upon them, will not be able to put forward ignorance as his excuse, or to
say, “I have never heard the trumpet sound, I did not foresee the conflict.” For he is set for
that very purpose, says Ezekiel, that he may sound the trumpet for others, and warn them
of the dangers at hand. And therefore his chastisement is inevitable, though he that perishes
happen to be but one. “For if when the sword comes, the watchman does not sound the
trumpet to the people, nor give them a sign, and the sword come and take any man away,
he indeed is taken away on account of his iniquity, but his blood will I require at the
watchman’s hands.”202</p>
<p>2. Cease then to urge us on to a penalty so inevitable; for our discourse is not about an
army, or a kingdom; but about an office which needs the virtues of an angel. For the soul
of the Priest ought to be purer than the very sunbeams, in order that the Holy Spirit may
not leave him desolate, in order that he may be able to say, “Now I live; and yet no longer
I, but Christ liveth in me.”203 For if they who dwell in the desert, and are removed far from
the city and the market-place, and the tumult therein, and who enjoy all their time a haven

of rest, and of peacefulness, are not willing to rely on the security of that manner of life, but
add to it numberless other safeguards, hedging themselves round on every side, and studying
both to speak and to act with great circumspection, so that to the utmost extent of human
power they may draw near to God with assurance, and with unstained purity, what power
and strength, thinkest thou, does the ordained Priest need so as to be able to tear his soul
away from every defilement, and to keep its spiritual beauty unsullied? For he has need of
far greater purity than they; and whoever has need of greater purity, he too is subject to
more pressing temptations than they, which are able to defile him, unless by using constant
self-denial and much labor, he renders his soul inaccessible to them. For beauty of face, elegance
of movement, an affected gait and lisping voice, pencilled eyebrows and enamelled
cheeks, elaborate braiding and dyeing of hair, costliness of dress, variety of golden ornaments,
and the glory of precious stones, the scent of perfumes, and all those other matters to which
womankind devote themselves, are enough to disorder the mind, unless it happen to be
hardened against them, through much austerity of self restraint. Now to be disturbed indeed
by such things is nothing wonderful. But on the other hand, that the devil should be able to
hit and shoot down the souls of men by the opposite of these—this is a matter which fills
us with astonishment and perplexity.</p>
<p>3. For ere now some men who have escaped these snares, have been caught by others
widely differing from these. For even a neglected appearance, unkempt hair, squalid dress,
and an unpainted face, simple behavior, and homely language, unstudied gait, and unaffected
voice, a life of poverty, a despised, unpatronized and lonely condition, have first drawn on
the beholder to pity, and next to utter ruin; and many who have escaped the former nets,
in the way of gold ornaments and perfumes, and apparel, and all the rest, of which I have
spoken as connected with them, have easily fallen into these so widely differing from them,
and have perished. When then both by poverty and by riches, both by the adornment and
the neglect of the personal appearance, both by studied and unaffected manners, in short
by all those means which I have enumerated, war is kindled in the soul of the beholder, and
its artifices surround him on every side, how will he be able to breathe freely while so many
snares encompass him? and what hiding-place will he be able to find—I do not say so as to
avoid being forcibly seized by them (for this is not altogether difficult)—but so as to keep
his own soul undisturbed by polluting thoughts?</p>
<p>And I pass by honors, which are the cause of countless evils. For those which come from
the hands of women are ruinous to the vigor of self-restraint, and often overthrow it when
a man does not know how to watch constantly against such designs; while those which come
from the hands of men, unless a man receive them with much nobleness of mind, he is
seized with two contrary emotions, servile flattery and senseless pride. To those who patronize
him, he is obliged to cringe; and towards his inferiors he is puffed up, on account of the
honors which the others confer, and is driven into the gulf of arrogance. We have mentioned

<pb n="110"/>
these matters indeed, but how harmful they actually are, no one could well learn without
experience. For not only these snares, but greater and more delusive than these, he must
needs encounter, who has his conversation in the world. But he who is content with solitude,
has freedom from all this, and if at any time a strange thought creates a representation of
this kind, the image is weak, and capable of being speedily subdued, because there is no fuel
added to the flame from without, arising from actual sight. For the recluse has but himself
to fear for; or should he be forced to have the care of others they are easily counted: and if
they be many, yet they are less than those in our Churches, and they give him who is set
over them much lighter anxiety about them, not only on account of their fewness, but because
they are all free from worldly concerns, and have neither wife nor children, nor any such
thing to care about; and this makes them very deferential to their rulers, and allows them
to share the same abode with them, so that they are able to take in their failings accurately
at a glance and correct them, seeing that the constant supervision of a teacher is no little
help towards advance in virtue.</p>
<p>4. But of those who are subject to the Priest, the greater number are hampered with the
cares of this life, and this makes them the slower in the performance of spiritual duties.
Whence it is necessary for the teacher to sow every day (so to speak), in order that by its
frequency at least, the word of doctrine may be able to be grasped by those who hear. For
excessive wealth, and an abundance of power, and sloth the offspring of luxury, and many
other things beside these, choke the seeds which have been let fall. Often too the thick growth
of thorns does not suffer the seed to drop even upon the surface of the soil. Again, excess
of trouble, stress of poverty, constant insults, and other such things, the reverse of the foregoing,
take the mind away from anxiety about things divine; and of their people’s sins, not
even the smallest part can become apparent; for how should it, in the case of those the majority
of whom they do not know even by sight?</p>
<p>The Priest’s relations with his people involve thus much difficulty. But if any inquire
about his relations with God, he will find the others to be as nothing, since these require a
greater and more thorough earnestness. For he who acts as an ambassador on behalf of the
whole city—but why do I say the city? on behalf of the whole world indeed—prays that God
would be merciful to the sins of all, not only of the living, but also of the departed.204 What
manner of man ought he to be? For my part I think that the boldness of speech of Moses
<note type="footnote">204 All the ancient Liturgies contained prayers for the departed. St. Cyril of Jerusalem (Catech. Mystag., v.
n. vi.), speaking of the prayer after consecration, says: “and then we pray for our holy fathers and bishops, and
for all that have fallen asleep before us, believing that it will be a very great benefit to their souls to have supplication
offered for them whilst the holy and most awful sacrifice is lying upon the altar,” but the practice was not
based upon anything like the later Roman doctrine of purgatory. It was the natural expression of a devout belief
in the “communion of saints.” See Bingham’s Antiquities, Book xv.</note>

<pb n="111"/>
and Elias, is insufficient for such supplication. For as though he were entrusted with the
whole world and were himself the father of all men, he draws near to God, beseeching that
wars may be extinguished everywhere, that tumults may be quelled; asking for peace and
plenty, and a swift deliverance from all the ills that beset each one, publicly and privately;
and he ought as much to excel in every respect all those on whose behalf he prays, as rulers
should excel their subjects.</p>
<p>And whenever he invokes the Holy Spirit, and offers the most dread sacrifice, and
constantly handles the common Lord of all, tell me what rank shall we give him? What great
purity and what real piety must we demand of him? For consider what manner of hands
they ought to be which minister in these things, and of what kind his tongue which utters
such words,205 and ought not the soul which receives so great a spirit to be purer and holier
than anything in the world? At such a time angels stand by the Priest; and the whole sanctuary,
and the space round about the altar, is filled with the powers of heaven, in honor of
Him who lieth thereon. For this, indeed, is capable of being proved from the very rites which
are being then celebrated. I myself, moreover, have heard some one once relate, that a certain
aged, venerable man, accustomed to see revelations, used to tell him, that he being thought
worthy of a vision of this kind, at such a time, saw, on a sudden, so far as was possible for
him, a multitude of angels, clothed in shining robes, and encircling the altar, and bending
down, as one might see soldiers in the presence of their King, and for my part I believe it.
Moreover another told me, without learning it from some one else, but as being himself
thought worthy to be both an ear and eye witness of it, that, in the case of those who are
about to depart hence, if they happen to be partakers of the mysteries, with a pure conscience,
when they are about to breathe their last, angels keep guard over them for the sake of what
they have received, and bear them hence. And dost thou not yet tremble to introduce a soul
into so sacred a mystery of this kind, and to advance to the dignity of the Priesthood, one
robed in filthy raiment, whom Christ has shut out from the rest of the band of guests?206
The soul of the Priest should shine like a light beaming over the whole world. But mine has
so great darkness overhanging it, because of my evil conscience, as to be always cast down
and never able to look up with confidence to its Lord. Priests are the salt of the earth.207
But who would easily put up with my lack of understanding, and my inexperience in all
things, but thou, who hast been wont to love me beyond measure. For the Priest ought not

only to be thus pure as one who has been dignified with so high a ministry, but very discreet,
and skilled in many matters, and to be as well versed in the affairs of this life as they who
are engaged in the world, and yet to be free from them all more than the recluses who occupy
the mountains. For since he must mix with men who have wives, and who bring up children,
who possess servants, and are surrounded with wealth, and fill public positions, and are
persons of influence, he too should be a many-sided man—I say many-sided, not unreal,
nor yet fawning and hypocritical, but full of much freedom and assurance, and knowing
how to adapt himself profitably, where the circumstances of the case require it, and to be
both kind and severe, for it is not possible to treat all those under one’s charge on one plan,
since neither is it well for physicians to apply one course of treatment to all their sick, nor
for a pilot to know but one way of contending with the winds. For, indeed, continual storms
beset this ship of ours, and these storms do not assail from without only, but take their rise
from within, and there is need of much condescension, and circumspection, and all these
different matters have one end in view, the glory of God, and the edifying of the Church.</p>
<p>5. Great is the conflict which recluses undergo, and much their toil.208 But if any one
compare their exertions with those which the right exercise of the Priesthood involves, he
will find the difference as great as the distance between a king and a commoner. For there,
if the labor is great indeed, yet the conflict is common to body and soul, or rather the
greater part of it is accomplished by the condition of the body, and if this be not strong, the
inclination remains undeveloped, and is unable to come out into action. For the habit of
intense fasting, and sleeping on the ground, and keeping vigil, and refraining from the bath,
and great toil, and all other means which they use for the affliction of the body are given
up, when the body to be thus disciplined is not strong. But in this case purity of soul is the
business in hand, and no bodily vigor is required to show its excellence. For what does
strength of body contribute towards our being not self-willed, or proud, or headstrong, but
sober and prudent, and orderly, and all else, wherein St. Paul filled up the picture of the
perfect Priest? But no one could say this of the virtues of the recluse.</p>
<p>6. But as in the case of wonder-workers, a large apparatus is required, both wheels and
ropes and daggers; while the philosopher has the whole of his art stored up in his mind, not
requiring any external appliances: So accordingly in the case before us. The recluse requires
both a good condition of body, and a place suitable for his course of life, in order that such
<note type="footnote">208 The following descriptions of monastic life were no doubt drawn from the habits of the monks in the
neighbourhood of Antioch, who dwelt on the mountainous heights of Silpius and Casius, south of the city. They
lived in separate huts or cabins, but were subject to an abbot and a common rule, probably very similar to that
which Pachomius had recently established in Egypt, and which became very generally adopted in the East. There
are frequent allusions to the habits of these monks in Chrysostom’s Homilies. See especially St. Matt. Hom.

<pb n="113"/>
may not be settled too far from intercourse with their fellow men, and may have the tranquillity
which belongs to desert places, and yet further, may not fail to enjoy the most favorable
climate. For nothing is so unbearable to a body worn with fastings as a climate which
is not equable. And what trouble they are compelled to take in the preparation of their
clothing and daily food, as they are themselves ambitious of doing all with their own hands,
I need not speak of now. But the Priest will require none of these things to supply his wants,
but is unconcerned about them, and participates in all things which are harmless, while he
has all his skill stored up in the treasure-house of his mind. But if any one admire a solitary
life, and retirement from the society of the multitude, I should say myself that such a life
was a token of patience, but not a sufficient proof of entire fortitude of soul. For the man
who sits at the helm in harbor, does not yet give any certain proof of his art. But if one is
able to guide his ship safely in the midst of the sea, no one would deny him to be an excellent
steersman.</p>
<p>7. It would be, therefore, in no wise excessively surprising to us, that the recluse, living
as he does by himself, is undisturbed and does not commit many and great sins. For he does
not meet with things which irritate and excite his mind. But if any one who has devoted
himself to whole multitudes, and has been compelled to bear the sins of many, has remained
steadfast and firm, guiding his soul in the midst of the storm as if he were in a calm, he is
the man to be justly applauded and admired of all, for he has shown sufficient proof of
personal manliness. Do not thou, therefore, for thy part wonder if I, who avoid the marketplace
and the haunts of the multitude, have not many to accuse me. For I ought not to
wonder, if I sinned not when asleep, nor fell when I did not wrestle, nor was hit if I did not
fight. For who, tell me, who will be able to speak against me, and reveal my depravity? Can
this roof or cell? Nay, they would not be able to give tongue? Would my mother, who best
of all knows my affairs? Well, certainly with her I am neither in communication, nor have
we ever come to a quarrel, and if this had happened, no mother is so heartless and wanting
in affection for her child as to revile and accuse before all him whom she travailed with, and
brought forth, and reared, if there were no reason to constrain her, nor any person to urge
her to such an act. Nevertheless, if any one desires to make a careful inspection of my mind,
he will discover much which is corrupt there. Nor art thou unaware of this who art specially
wont to extol me with praises before all. Now that I do not say these things out of mere
modesty, recollect how often I said to thee, when this subject was being discussed between
us, “If any one were to give me my choice whether I would rather gain distinction in the
oversight of the Church, or in the life of the recluse, I would vote a thousand times over for
accepting the former. For I have never failed to congratulate those who have been able to
discharge this office well, and no one will gainsay that what I counted blessed I would not
have shunned were I able to take part in it fitly. But what am I to do? There is nothing so
prejudicial to the oversight of the Church as this inactivity and negligence of mine, which

<pb n="114"/>
others think to be a sort of self-discipline, but which I hold to be a veil as it were of my
personal infirmity, covering the greater number of my defects and not suffering them to
appear. For he who is accustomed to enjoy such great freedom from business, and to pass
his time in much repose, even if he be of a noble nature, is confused by his inexperience,
and is disturbed, and his inactivity deprives him of no small part of his natural ability. But
when, besides, he is of slow intellect, and ignorant also of these severe trials, which I take it
is my case, he will carry on this ministry which he has received no better than a statue.
Wherefore of those who have come to such great trial, out of that school, few shine; and the
greater part betray themselves, and fall, and undergo much hardship and sufferings; and no
wonder. For the trials and the discipline are not concerned with the same things. The man
who is contending in no wise differs from those who are untrained. He who thus enters this
list should despise glory, be superior to anger, full of great discretion. But for the exercise
of these qualities there is no scope in his case who affects a secluded life. For he does not
have many to provoke him in order that he may practise chastising, the force of his anger:
nor admirers and applauders in order that he may be trained to despise the praises of the
multitudes. And of the discretion which is required in the Church, there is no taking account
in their case. Whenever, therefore, they come to the trials of which they have never had
practical experience, they get bewildered, their heads are turned, they fall into a state of
helplessness, and besides adding nothing to their excellence, may have often lost that which
they brought with them.</p>
<p>8. Basil: What then? shall we set over the administration of the Church those who move
in society, and who are careful about the concerns of this world, who are adepts at wrangling
and vituperation, are full of countless artifices, and versed in luxurious ways?</p>
<p>Chrysostom: Hush, dear friend that thou art! Thou shouldest never entertain in thy
thoughts such men as these, when the Priesthood is under discussion, but only such as are
able after mixing and associating with all, to keep their purity undefiled, and their unworldliness,
their holiness, constancy and sobriety unshaken, and to possess all other virtues which
belong to recluses, in a greater degree than they. He who has many defects, but is able to
hide them, by means of his seclusion, and to make them ineffectual, because he does not
associate with any one, when he comes into society will gain nothing, but the position of a
laughing-stock, and will run greater risks still, which I was very nearly experiencing myself,
had not the providence of God quickly warded off such fire from my head. For it is not
possible for one in such a position to escape notice when he is so conspicuously placed, but
everything then is detected, and as the fire tests the material of metals, so too the trial of the
clerical office searches the souls of mortal men; and if any one be passionate or mean, or
ambitious of fame, if he be boastful, or anything else of the kind, it unveils all; and speedily
lays bare his defects, and not only lays them bare, but increases their painfulness and strength.
For the wounds of the body, if they are galled, become harder to heal, and the emotions of

<pb n="115"/>
the mind when chafed and irritated, are naturally more exasperated, and those who possess
them are driven to commit greater sins. For they excite him who does not restrain them, to
love of glory, and to boastfulness, and to desire for this world’s goods, and draw him
downwards, both to luxury and laxity of life, and to laziness, and, little by little, to evils worse
than these which result from them. For many are the circumstances in society which have
the power to upset the balance of the mind, and to hinder its straightforward course;209 and
first of all is his social intercourse with women. For it is not possible for the Bishop, and one
who is concerned with the whole flock, to have a care for the male portion of it, but to pass
over the female, which needs more particular forethought, because of its propensity to sins.
But the man who is appointed to the administration of a Bishopric must have a care for the
moral health of these, if not in a greater, at least in no less a degree than the others. For it is
necessary to visit them when they are sick, to comfort them when they are sorrowful, and
to reprove them when they are idle, and to help them when they are distressed; and in such
cases the evil one would find many opportunities of approach, if a man did not fortify
himself with a very strict guard. For the eye, not only of the unchaste, but of the modest
woman pierces and disturbs the mind. Flatteries enervate it, and favors enslave it, and fervent
love—the spring one may say of all good—becomes the cause of countless evils to those who
do not make a right use of it. Constant cares too have ere now blunted the edge of the understanding,
and have made that which was buoyant heavier than lead, while anger has
burst in like smoke, and taken possession of all the inner man.</p>
<p>9. Why should any one speak of the injuries that result from grief,210 the insults, the
abuse, the censure from superiors, from inferiors, from the wise, and from fools; for the
class who are wanting in right judgment are particularly fond of censuring, and will never
readily allow any excuse. But the truly excellent Bishop ought neither to think lightly of
these, but to clear himself with all men of the charges which they bring against him, with
great forbearance and meekness, pardoning their unreasonable fault-finding, rather than
being indignant and angry about it. For if St. Paul feared lest he should incur a suspicion of
theft, among his disciples, and therefore procured others for the management of the money,
that “no one” he says, “should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us,”211
how ought we not to do all so as to remove evil suspicions, even if they happen to be false,
and most unreasonable, and very foreign to our thought? For we are not so utterly removed
from any sin as St. Paul from theft; notwithstanding, though so far from this evil practice,
he did not, therefore, slight the suspicion of the world, although it was very absurd, and
even insane. For it was madness to have any such suspicion about that blessed and admirable
<note type="footnote">209 Another reading gives its “career towards God.”</note>
<note type="footnote">210 According to a different reading, τὰς λσιπὰς βχ€βας, “The injuries which remain.”</note>
<note type="footnote">211 2 Cor. viii. 20.</note>

<pb n="116"/>
character. But none the less does he remove far off the causes of this suspicion, unreasonable
though it was, and such as no one who was in his senses would entertain, and he neither
disdained the folly of the multitudes, nor did he say, “To whose mind did it ever occur to
suspect such things of us, after the signs which I have wrought, and the forbearance which
has marked my life, and when you all revered and admired us?” Quite the contrary: he
foresaw and expected this base suspicion, and pulled it up by the roots, or rather did not
suffer it to grow at all. Why? “Because,” saith he, “we provide things honest not only before
the Lord, but before all men.”212 So great, yea and far greater zeal must we use, to uproot
and prevent floating reports which are not good, but to see beforehand from afar whence
they come, and to remove beforehand the causes from which they are produced, not to wait
till they are established and are the common topics in every one’s mouth. For then it is not
easy in the future to destroy them, but very difficult, perhaps impossible, and not without
mischief, because this is done after many have been injured. But how far shall I continue
pursuing the unattainable? For to enumerate all the difficulties in this direction, is nothing
more nor less than measuring the ocean. Even when any one should clear himself from
every passion (which is a thing impossible) in order to correct the failings of others, he is
forced to undergo countless trials, and when his own infirmities are added, behold, an abyss
of toil and care, and all that he must suffer, who wishes to subdue the evils in himself and
in those around him.</p>
<p>10. Basil: And now, art thou free from toils? hast thou no cares while thou livest by
thyself?</p>
<p>Chrysostom: I have indeed even now. For how is it possible for one who is a man, and
who is living this toilsome life of ours, to be free from cares and conflict? But it is not quite
the same thing for man to plunge into a boundless ocean and to cross a river, so great is the
difference between these cares and those. For now, indeed, if I were able to become serviceable
to others, I should wish it myself, and this would be a matter of prayer with me. But if it is
not possible to help another, yet if it be practicable to save and rescue myself from the waves,
I shall be contented.</p>
<p>Basil: Dost thou then think this to be a great thing? and dost thou fancy that thou wilt
be saved when thou art not profitable to any other?</p>
<p>Chrysostom: Thou hast spoken well and nobly, for I am not myself able to believe that
it is possible for one who has not labored for the salvation of his fellow to be saved, nor did
it at all profit the wretched man in the Gospel that he had not diminished his talent; but he
perished through not increasing it and bringing it doubled to his master.213 Nevertheless,
I think that my punishment will be milder when I am called to account, because I have not
<note type="footnote">212 2 Cor. viii. 21; Rom. xii. 17.</note>
<note type="footnote">213 Matt. xxv. 24.</note>

<pb n="117"/>
saved others, than it would be if I should destroy myself and others too by becoming far
worse after so great an honor. For now I trust that my chastisement will be proportioned
to the amount of my sins, but after receiving this office, I fear it would be not double, or
threefold, but manifold, because I should have caused very many to stumble, and after additional
honor should have offended the God who honored me.</p>
<p>11. For this very cause God accuses the Israelites more vehemently, and shows that they
were worthy of greater chastisement, because they sinned after so many honors had come
to them from Him, saying in one place: “But you only have I known of all the families of
the earth, therefore will I punish you for your iniquities,”214 and again, “and I raised up of
your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites;”215 and before the times of
the prophets, wishing to show that sins receive sorer punishment by far when they occur
in the case of the Priest than in the case of the laity, He enjoins as great a sacrifice to be
offered for the Priest as for the whole people,216 and this amounts to a proof on his part,
that the wounds of the Priesthood need more assistance—that is, as great as those of all the
people together, and they would not have needed a greater, except they were worse; and
they are not worse in their nature, but are aggravated through the dignity of the Priest, who
dares to commit them. And why do I speak of the men who follow this ministration. For
the daughters of the Priests,217 who have no part in the Priestly office, yet on account of
their father’s dignity undergo a far bitterer punishment for the same sins as others, and the
offense is the same in their case and in the daughters of the laity; namely, fornication in
both; yet the penalty is far severer for the former. Dost thou see with what abundant proof
God shows thee that he demands much greater punishment for the ruler than for the ruled?
For no doubt he who punishes to a greater degree than others the daughter of a certain man
for that man’s sake, will not exact the same penalty from the man who is the cause of her
additional chastisement as from others, but a much heavier one; and very reasonably; for
the mischief does not merely involve himself, but it destroys the souls of the weaker brethren
and of them who look up to him, and Ezekiel, writing to show this, distinguishes from one
another the judgment of the rams and of the sheep.218</p>
<p>12. Do we then seem to thee to entertain a reasonable fear? for in addition to what has
been said, although much toil is needful on my part, so that I should not be completely
overwhelmed by the passions of my soul, yet I endure the toil, and I do not shun the conflict.
For even now I am taken captive by vainglory, but I often recover myself, and I see at a

<pb n="118"/>
glance that I have been taken, and there are times when I rebuke my soul, which has been
enslaved; outrageous desires even now come over me, but they kindle only a languid flame,
since my bodily eyes cannot fasten upon any fuel to feed the fire. From speaking ill of any,
or from hearing any one evil spoken of, I am utterly removed, since I have no one to talk
with; for surely these walls would never give tongue; yet it is not altogether in like manner
possible to avoid anger, although there be none to provoke it. For often when the recollection
of outrageous men has come over me, and of the deeds done by them, it makes my heart
swell. But not permanently, for I quickly subdue its kindling, and persuade it to be quiet,
saying that it is very inexpedient and extremely despicable to leave one’s own fault alone,
and to busy one’s self about the faults of one’s neighbors. But were I to come among the
multitude, and to be involved in countless excitements, I should not be able to have the benefit
of this warning, nor to experience reflections which take me thus to task. But just as
they who are driven over precipices by a torrent, or in some other way, are able to foresee
the destruction to which they are finally going, and are unable to think of any means of help,
so I, when I have fallen into the great tumult of my passions, shall be able to see at a glance
my chastisement daily increasing. But to be master of myself as I am now, and to rebuke
diseases of this sort raging on every side, would not be equally easy for me as it was before.
For my soul is weak and puny, and easily mastered, not only by these passions, but by envy,
which is bitterer than all of them. Neither does it know how to bear insults or honors temperately.
But these do exceedingly elate it, while those depress it. As, then, savage wild beasts,
when they are in good condition, and in full vigor, overcome those that fight with them,
particularly, too, if they be feeble and unskillful; but if any one were to weaken them by
starvation, he will put their rage to sleep, and will extinguish most of their strength; so that
one, not over valiant, might take up the conflict and battle with them: so also with the passions
of the soul. He who makes them weak, places them in subjection to right reason; but he who
nourishes them carefully, makes his battle with them harder, and renders them so formidable
that he passes all his time in bondage and fear.</p>
<p>What then is the food of these wild beasts? Of vainglory, indeed, it is honors and ap-
plause; of pride, abundance of authority and power; of envy, the reputation of one’s neighbors;
of avarice, the munificence of the generous; of incontinence, luxury and the constant society
of women; and other passions have their proper nutriment? And all these things will sorely
attack me if I come forth into the world, and will tear my soul to pieces, will be the more
formidable and will make my battle with them the harder. Whereas, while I am established
here they will be subdued; and then, indeed, only with great exertion; yet at the same time,
by the Grace of God, they will be subdued, and there will not be anything worse then than
their bark. For these reasons I keep to this cell, and am inaccessible, self-contained, and
unsociable, and I put up with hearing countless complaints of this kind, although I would
gladly efface them, and have been vexed and grieved because I cannot; for it is not easy for

<pb n="119"/>
me to become sociable, and at the same time to remain in my present security. Therefore I
beseech thee, too, to pity rather than to censure one beset with such great difficulty.</p>
<p>But we cannot yet persuade thee. Accordingly the time is now come that I should utter
to thee the only thing which I have left unspoken. Perhaps it may seem to many to be incredible,
but even so I shall not be ashamed to bring it before the world, for though what is said
is proof of an evil conscience and of many sins, yet, since God, who is about to judge us,
knows all accurately, what gain will result to us from the ignorance of men? What then is
this, which is yet unspoken? From that day on which thou didst impart to me the suspicion
of the bishopric, my whole system has often been in danger of being completely unhinged,
such was the fear, such the despondency which seized my soul; for on considering the glory
of the Bride of Christ, the holiness, the spiritual beauty and wisdom, and comeliness, and
then reckoning up my own faults, I used not to cease bewailing both her and myself, and
amidst continual distress and perplexity, I kept saying—who then made such a suggestion
as this? why has the Church of God made so great a mistake? why has she so provoked her
Master, as to be delivered over to me, the unworthiest of all men, and to undergo such great
disgrace? Considering these things often by myself, and being unable to bear the thought
of so monstrous a thing, I used to be like thunderstruck people, speechless, and unable either
to see or hear. And when this condition of great helplessness left me, for there were times
when it passed off, tears and despondency succeeded to it, and after the flood of tears, then
fear again, entered in their stead, disturbing, confusing and agitating my mind. In such a
tempest I used to pass the time that is gone; but thou wast ignorant of it, and thoughtest
that I was spending my time in a perfect tranquillity, but I will now try and unveil to thee
the storm of my soul, for it may be thou wilt henceforth pardon me, abandoning your accusations.
How then shall I unveil this to thee? For if thou wouldest see this clearly, it is not
otherwise possible than by laying bare my own heart; but as this is impossible, I will try and
show you as well as I can, by a certain faint illustration, the gloom of my despondency, and
from this image please to infer my condition.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that the daughter of the King of all the earth under the sun is the betrothed
of a certain man, and that this damsel has matchless beauty, transcending that of human
nature, and that in this respect she outstrips by a long distance the whole race of women;
also that she has virtues of the soul, so great as to distance by a long way the whole generation
of men that have been, or that shall be; and that the grace of her manners transcends all
standards of art, and that the loveliness of her person is eclipsed by the beauty of her countenance;
and that her betrothed, not only for the sake of these things, is enamored of the
maiden, but apart from these things has an affection for her, and by his ardor throws into
the shade the most passionate of lovers that ever were. Then let us suppose, whilst he is
burning with love, he hears from some quarter that some mean, abject man, low born, and
crippled in body, in fact a thoroughly bad fellow, was about to wed this wondrous, well-be-

<pb n="120"/>
loved maiden. Have we then presented to thee some small portion of our grief? and is it
enough to stay my illustration at this point? So far as my despondency is concerned, I think
it is enough; for this was the only purpose for which I introduced the comparison, but that
I may show you the measure of my fear, and my terror, let me proceed to another description.</p>
<p>Let there be an armament composed of infantry, cavalry, and marines, and let a number
of triremes cover the sea, and phalanxes of foot and horse cover most of the plains, and the
ridges of the mountains, and let the metal of their armor reflect the sunshine, and the glitter
of the helmets and shields be reflected by the beams which are emitted from them; let the
clashing of spears and the neighing of horses be borne up to the very heavens, and let neither
sea nor land appear, but only brass and iron in every direction. Let the enemy be drawn up
in battle array opposite to these, fierce and savage men, and let the time of the engagement
be now at hand. Then let some one suddenly seize some young lad, one of those brought
up in the country, knowing nothing but the use of the shepherd’s pipe and crook; let him
be clad in brazen armor, and let him be led round the whole camp and be shown the
squadrons and their officers, the archers, slingers, captains, generals, the foot and horse, the
spearmen, the triremes and their commanders, the dense mass of soldiers in the ships, and
the multitude of engines of war lying ready on board. Let him be shown, moreover, the
whole array of the enemy, their repulsive aspect, and the varied stores and unusual quantity
of their arms; the ravines also and precipices of the mountains, deep and difficult. Let him
be shown further on the enemies’ side, horses flying by some enchantment and infantry
borne through the air, and sorcery of every power and form; and let him consider the
calamities of war, the cloud of spears, the hailstorm of arrows, that great mist and obscurity
that gloomiest night which the multitude of weapons occasions, eclipsing the sunbeams
with their cloud, the dust no less than the darkness baffling the eyesight. The torrents of
blood, the groanings of the falling, the shouts of the surviving, the heaps of slain, wheels
bathed in blood, horses with their riders thrown headlong down, owing to the number of
corpses, the ground a scene of general confusion, blood, and bows, and arrows, hoofs of
horses and heads of men lying together, a human arm and a chariot wheel and a helmet, a
breast pierced through, brains sticking to swords, the point of a dart broken off with an eye
transfixed upon it. Then let him reckon up the sufferings of the naval force, the triremes
burning in the midst of the waves, and sinking with their armed crews, the roaring of the
sea, the tumult of the sailors, the shout of the soldiers, the foam of the waves mixed with
blood, and dashing over into all the ships; the corpses on the decks, some sinking, some
floating, some cast upon the beach, overwhelmed by the waves, and obstructing the passage
of the ships. And when he has been carefully instructed in all the tragedy of warfare, let the
horrors of captivity and of slavery be added to it, worse than any kind of death; and having
told him all this, bid him mount his horse straightway, and take command of all that armament.</p>

<pb n="121"/>
<p>Dost thou really think that this lad would be equal to more than the mere description,
and would not, at the very first glance, lose heart?</p>
<p>13. Do not think that I have exaggerated the matter by my account, nor suppose that
because we are shut up in this body, as in some prison house, and are unable to see anything
of the invisible world, that what has been said is overstated. For thou wouldest see a far
greater and more formidable conflict than this, couldest thou ever behold, with these eyes
of thine, the devil’s most gloomy battle array, and his frantic onset. For there is no brass or
iron there. No horses, or chariots or wheels, no fire and darts. These are visible things. But
there are other much more fearful engines than these. One does not need against these enemies
breastplate or shield, sword and spear, yet the sight only of this accursed array is
enough to paralyze the soul, unless it happen to be very noble, and to enjoy in a high degree
as a protection to its own courage the providential care of God. And if it were possible by
putting off this body, or still keeping it, to see clearly and fearlessly with the naked eye the
whole of his battle array, and his warfare against us, thou wouldest see no torrents of blood,
nor dead bodies, but so many fallen souls, and such disastrous wounds that the whole of
that description of warfare which I just now detailed to thee thou wouldest think to be mere
child’s sport and pastime rather than war: so many are there smitten every day, and the
wounds in the two cases do not bring about the same death, but as great as is the difference
between the soul from the body, so great is the difference between that death and this. For
when the soul receives a wound, and falls, it does not lie as a lifeless body, but it is thenceforth
tormented, being gnawed by an evil conscience; and after its removal hence, at the time of
judgment, it is delivered over to eternal punishment; and if any one be without grief in regard
to the wounds given by the devil, his danger becomes the greater for his insensibility. For
whoever is not pained by the first wound, will readily receive a second, and after that a third.
For the unclean spirit will not cease assaulting to the last breath, whenever he finds a soul
supine and indifferent to his first wounds; and if thou wouldest inquire into the method of
attack, thou wouldest find this much more severe and varied. For no one ever knew so many
forms of craft and deceit as that unclean spirit. By this indeed, he has acquired the greater
part of his power, nor can any one have so implacable a hatred against his worst enemies
as the evil one against the human race. And if any one inquire into the vehemence with
which he fights, here again it would be ludicrous to bring men into comparison with him.
But if any one choose out the fiercest and most savage of beasts, and is minded to set their
fury against his, he will find that they were meek and quiet in comparison, such rage does
he breathe forth when he attacks our souls; and the period of the warfare indeed in the
former case is brief, and in this brief space there are respites; for the approach of the night
and the fatigue of slaughter, meal-times also, and many other things, afford a respite to the
soldier, so that he can doff his armor and breathe a little, and refresh himself with food and
drink, and in many other ways recover his former strength. But in the case of the evil one

<pb n="122"/>
it is not possible ever to lay aside one’s armor, it is not possible even to take sleep, for one
who would remain always unscathed. For one of two things must be: either to fall and perish
unarmed, or to stand equipped and ever watchful. For he ever stands with his own battle
array, watching for our indolence, and laboring more zealously for our destruction, than
we for our salvation.</p>
<p>And that he is not seen by us, and suddenly assails us, which things are a source of
countless evils to those who are not always on the watch, proves this kind of war to be harder
than the other. Couldest thou wish us, then, in such a case to command the soldiers of
Christ? yea, this were to command them for the devil’s service, for whenever he who ought
to marshal and order others is the most inexperienced and feeble of all men, by betraying
through this inexperience those who have been entrusted to his charge, he commands them
in the devil’s interests rather than in Christ’s.</p>
<p>But why dost thou sigh? why weep? For my ease does not now call for wailing, but for
joy and gladness.</p>
<p>Basil: But not my case, yea this calls for countless lamentations. For I am hardly able
yet to understand to what degree of evil thou hast brought me. For I came to thee wanting
to learn what excuse I should make on thy behalf to those who find fault with thee; but thou
sendest me back after putting another case in the place of that I had. For I am no longer
concerned about the excuses I shall give them on thy behalf, but what excuse I shall make
to God for myself and my own faults. But I beseech thee, and implore thee, if my welfare is
at all regarded by thee, if there be any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any
bowels, and mercies,219 for thou knowest that thyself above all hast brought me into this
danger, stretch forth thine hand, both saying and doing what is able to restore me, do not
have the heart to leave me for the briefest moment, but now rather than before let me pass
my life with thee.</p>
<p>Chrysostom: But I smiled, and said, how shall I be able to help, how to profit thee under
so great a burden of office? But since this is pleasant to thee, take courage, dear soul, for at
any time at which it is possible for thee to have leisure amid thine own cares, I will come
and will comfort thee, and nothing shall be wanting of what is in my power.</p>
<p>On this, he weeping yet more, rose up. But I, having embraced him and kissed his head,
led him forth, exhorting him to bear his lot bravely. For I believe, said I, that through Christ
who has called thee, and set thee over his own sheep, thou wilt obtain such assurance from
this ministry as to receive me also, if I am in danger at the last day, into thine everlasting
tabernacle.</p>

<p>ST. CHRYSOSTOM:
AN EXHORTATION TO THEODORE AFTER HIS
FALL</p>
<p>TRANSLATED WITH INTRODUCTION AND NOTES BY
REV. W. R. W. STEPHENS, M.A.,
PREBENDARY OF CHICHESTER, AND RECTOR OF WOOLBEDING, SUSSEX.</p>

<pb n="124"/>
<head>INTRODUCTION TO THE LETTERS TO THEODORE.</head>
<p>These two letters, which are the earliest of Chrysostom’s extant works, are addressed
to a friend who had been a member of the little ascetic brotherhood which Chrysostom and
Basil formed, soon after they had abandoned secular life, as described in the first book of
the Treatise on the Priesthood. Theodore, like Maximus, afterwards Bishop of Isaurian
Seleucia, who was another member of the same fraternity, had been a fellow student with
Chrysostom and Basil in the school of Libanius,220 but was a few years younger than either
of them. The strain upon his powers of religious devotion had proved too much for him;
he had withdrawn from the ascetic brotherhood, and relapsed for a season into worldly
habits, being fascinated by the beauty of a young lady named Hermione, whom he was
anxious to marry. His fall was regarded with almost as much sorrow and dismay by his
austere friends as if he had plunged into deadly vice. Prayers were continually offered, and
great efforts made for his restoration, amongst which must be reckoned the two letters which
are here translated. They are the productions of a youthful enthusiast, and as such allowances
must be made for them; but they abound in passages of great beauty and power, especially
upon the infinite love and forbearance of God, as encouraging to repentance and withholding
from despair and recklessness into which Theodore seems to have been inclined to sink.
The appeal of Chrysostom, combined with the efforts of his other friends, was not in vain.
Theodore once more renounced the world and his matrimonial intentions, and retired into
the seclusion of the fraternity. In A.D. 383, when he was about thirty-three years of age, he
was ordained priest, and in 392 he became Bishop of Mopsuestia, where he died in A.D.
428 at the age of seventy-eight. Chrysostom seems to have retained his affection to him to
the last, and during his own exile at Cucusus, A.D. 404–7, wrote a letter to him which is full
of expressions of fervent admiration and regard. He was a most voluminous writer, and
may be regarded as the ablest representative of the school of Biblical interpretation founded
by Diodorus of Tarsus, under whom he had studied, together with Chrysostom and Basil.
A fierce controversy raged during the fifth and sixth centuries respecting the orthodoxy of
some of his writings which some accused of preparing the way for Nestorianism. When this
had died down his name was comparatively forgotten, and it is only in modern times that
his great merits as a commentator, who boldly applied the historical and grammatical
methods of examination to the books of Holy Scripture, have been fully recognized.</p>
<p>Tillemont was of opinion that of the two letters of Chrysostom the second only was
addressed to Theodore, who was afterwards Bishop of Mopsuestia. Montfaucon, however,
Dupin, and Savile, maintain that both were addressed to him, and their view is confirmed
by the fact that Leontius of Byzantium (in Nest. et. Eutych. lib. iii. c. 7) and Isidore of Seville
(de Script. Eccl. c. 6.) mention two letters of Chrysostom to Theodore of Mopsuestia.</p>

<head>AN EXHORTATION TO THEODORE AFTER HIS
FALL.</head>
<head>Letter I.</head>
<p>“Oh! that my head were water, and mine eyes a fountain of tears!”221 it is seasonable
for me to utter these words now, yea much more than for the prophet in his time. For although
I am not about to mourn over many cities, or whole nations, yet shall I mourn over
a soul which is of equal value with many such nations, yea even more precious. For if one
man who does the will of God is better than ten thousand transgressors, then thou wast
formerly better than ten thousand Jews. Wherefore no one would now blame me if I were
to compose more lamentations than those which are contained in the prophet, and to utter
complaints yet more vehement. For it is not the overthrow of a city which I mourn, nor the
captivity of wicked men, but the desolation of a sacred soul, the destruction and effacement
of a Christ-bearing temple.222 For would not any one who knew in the days of its glory that
well-ordered mind of thine which the devil has now set on fire, groan, imitating the lamentation
of the prophet; when he hears that barbarian hands have defiled the holy of holies,
and have set fire to all things and burned them up, the cherubim, the ark, the mercy seat,
the tables of stone, the golden pot? For this calamity is bitterer, yea bitterer than that, in
proportion as the pledges deposited in thy soul were far more precious than those. This
temple is holier than that; for it glistened not with gold and silver, but with the grace of the
Spirit, and in place of the ark and the cherubim, it had Christ, and His Father, and the
Paraclete seated within. But now all is changed, and the temple is desolate, and bare of its
former beauty and comeliness, unadorned with its divine and unspeakable adornments,
destitute of all security and protection; it has neither door nor bolt, and is laid open to all
manner of soul-destroying and shameful thoughts; and if the thought of arrogance or fornication,
or avarice, or any more accursed than these, wish to enter in there is no one to
hinder them; whereas formerly, even as the Heaven is inaccessible to all these, so also was
the purity of thy soul. Now perhaps I shall seem to say what is incredible to some who now
witness thy desolation and overthrow; for on this account I wail and mourn, and shall not
cease doing so, until I see thee again established in thy former lustre. For although this seems

privileges and duties. See note, p. 73.</note>

<pb n="126"/>
to be impossible to men, yet to God all things are possible. For it is He “who raiseth the poor
from the earth, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set him with the princes, even
with the princes of his people.” It is He “who makes the barren woman to dwell at home, a
mother rejoicing over her children.”223 Do not then despair of the most perfect change. For
if the devil had such great power as to cast thee down from that pinnacle and height of virtue
into the extremity of evil doing, much more will God be able to draw thee up again to thy
former confidence; and not only indeed to make you what you were before, but even much
happier. Only be not downcast, nor fling away good hopes, nor fall into the condition of
the ungodly. For it is not the multitude of sins which is wont to plunge men into despair,
but impiety of soul. Therefore Solomon did not make the unqualified statement “every one
who has entered into the den of the wicked, despiseth;” but only “he who is ungodly.”224
For it is such persons only who are affected in this way when they have entered the den of
the wicked. And this it is which does not suffer them to look up, and re-ascend to the position
from which they fell. For this accursed thought pressing down like some yoke upon the neck
of the soul, and so forcing it to stoop, hinders it from looking up to the Master. Now it is
the part of a brave and excellent man to break this yoke in pieces, to shake off the tormentor
fastened upon him; and to utter the words of the prophet, “As the eyes of a maiden look
unto the hands of her mistress, even so our eyes look unto the Lord our God until He have
mercy upon us. Have pity upon us, O Lord, have pity upon us, for we have been utterly filled
with contempt.”225 Truly divine are these precepts, and decrees of the highest form of
spiritual wisdom. We have been filled, it is said, with contempt, and have undergone
countless distresses; nevertheless we shall not desist from looking up to God, neither shall
we cease praying to him until He has received our petition. For this is the mark of a noble
soul, not to be cast down, nor be dismayed at the multitude of the calamities which oppress
it, nor to withdraw, after praying many times without success, but to persevere, until He
have mercy upon us, even as the blessed David saith.</p>
<p>2. For the reason why the devil plunges us into thoughts of despair is that he may cut
off the hope which is towards God, the safe anchor, the foundation of our life, the guide of
the way which leads to heaven, the salvation of perishing souls. “For by hope” it is said, “we
are saved.”226 For this assuredly it is which, like some strong cord suspended from the
heavens, supports our souls, gradually drawing towards that world on high those who cling
firmly to it, and lifting them above the tempest of the evils of this life. If any one then becomes
enervated, and lets go this sacred anchor, straightway he falls down, and is suffocated, having

<pb n="127"/>
entered into the abyss of wickedness. And the Evil One knowing this, when he perceives
that we are ourselves oppressed by the consciousness of evil deeds, steps in himself and lays
upon us the additional burden, heavier than lead, of anxiety arising from despair; and if we
accept it, it follows of necessity that we are forthwith dragged down by the weight, and
having been parted from that cord, descend into the depth of misery where thou thyself art
now, having forsaken the commandments of the meek and lowly Master and executing all
the injunctions of the cruel tyrant, and implacable enemy of our salvation; having broken
in pieces the easy yoke, and cast away the light burden, and having put on the iron collar
instead of these things, yea, having hung the ponderous millstone227 from thy neck. Where
then canst thou find a footing henceforth when thou art submerging thy unhappy soul,
imposing on thyself this necessity of continually sinking downwards? Now the woman who
had found the one coin called her neighbors to share her joy; saying, “Rejoice with me;” but
I shall now invoke all friends, both mine and thine, for the contrary purpose, saying not
“Rejoice with me” but “Mourn with me,” and take up the same strain of mourning, and utter
the same cry of distress with me. For the worst possible loss has befallen me, not that some
given number of talents of gold, or some large quantity of precious stones have dropped
out of my hand, but that he who was more precious than all these things, who was sailing
over this same sea, this great and broad sea with me, has, I know not how, slipped overboard,
and fallen into the very pit of destruction.</p>
<p>3. Now if any should attempt to divert me from mourning, I shall reply to them in the
words of the prophet, saying “Let me alone, I will weep bitterly; labour not to comfort me.”228
For the mourning with which I mourn now is not of a kind to subject me to condemnation
for excess in lamentation, but the cause is one for which even Paul, or Peter, had they been
here, would not have been ashamed to weep and mourn, and reject all kinds of consolation.
For those who bewail that death which is common to all one might reasonably accuse of
much feebleness of spirit; but when in place of a corpse a dead soul lies before us, pierced
with innumerable wounds, and yet even in its death manifesting its former natural comeliness,
and health, and beauty now extinguished, who can be so harsh and unsympathetic as
to utter words of encouragement in place of wailing and lamentation? For as in the other
world the absence of mourning is a mark of divine wisdom, so in this world the act of
mourning is a mark of the same. He who had already mounted to the sky, who was laughing
to scorn the vanity of this life, who regarded bodily beauty no more than if it had been in
forms of stone, who despised gold as it had been mud, and every kind of luxury as mire,
even he, having been suddenly overwhelmed with the feverish longing of a preposterous

<pb n="128"/>
passion, has ruined his health, and manly strength, and the bloom of his youth, and become
a slave of pleasure. Shall we not weep then, I pray you, for such a man and bewail him, until
we have got him back again? And where do these things concern the human soul? It is not
possible indeed to discover in this world the means of release from the death of the body,
and yet even this does not stay the mourners from lamenting; but only in this world is it
possible to bring to naught the death of the soul. “For in Hades” we read, “who will confess
thee?”229 Is it not then the height of stupidity that they who mourn the death of the body
should do this so earnestly, although they know that they will not raise the dead man to life
by their lamentation; but that we should not manifest anything of the kind, and this when
we know that often there is hope of conducting the lost soul back to its former life? For
many both now and in the days of our forefathers, having been perverted from the right
position, and fallen headlong out of the straight path, have been so completely restored as
to eclipse their former deeds by the latter, and to receive the prize, and be wreathed with
the garland of victory, and be proclaimed among the conquerors, and be numbered in the
company of the saints. For as long as any one stands in the furnace of pleasures, even if he
has countless examples of this kind before him, the thing seems to him to be impossible;
but if he once gets a short start upon the way out from thence, by continually advancing he
leaves the fiercer part of the fire behind him and will see the parts which are in front of him,
and before his footsteps full of dew and much refreshment; only let us not despair or grow
weary of the return; for he who is so affected, even if he has acquired boundless power and
zeal, has acquired it to no purpose. For when he has once shut the door of repentance against
himself, and has blocked the entrance into the race-course, how will he be able while he
abides outside to accomplish any good thing, either small or great? On this account the Evil
One uses all kinds of devices in order to plant in us this thought (of despair); for (if he succeeds)
he will no longer have to sweat and toil in contending with us; how should he, when
we are prostrate and fallen, and unwilling to resist him? For he who has been able to slip
out of this chain, will recover his own strength and will not cease struggling against the
devil to his last gasp, and even if he had countless other falls, he will get up again, and will
smite his enemy; but he who is in bondage to the cogitations of despair, and has unstrung
his own strength, how will he be able to prevail, and to resist, having on the contrary taken
to flight?</p>
<p>4. And speak not to me of those who have committed small sins, but suppose the case
of one who is filled full of all wickedness, and let him practice everything which excludes
him from the kingdom, and let us suppose that this man is not one of those who were unbelievers
from the beginning, but formerly belonged to the believers, and such as were well
pleasing to God, but afterwards has become a fornicator, adulterer, effeminate, a thief, a
<note type="footnote">229 Ps. vi. 5.</note>

<pb n="129"/>
drunkard, a sodomite, a reviler, and everything else of this kind; I will not approve even of
this man despairing of himself, although he may have gone on to extreme old age in the
practice of this great and unspeakable wickedness. For if the wrath of God were a passion,
one might well despair as being unable to quench the flame which he had kindled by so
many evil doings; but since the Divine nature is passionless, even if He punishes, even if He
takes vengeance, he does this not with wrath, but with tender care, and much loving-kindness;
wherefore it behoves us to be of much good courage, and to trust in the power of repentance.
For even those who have sinned against Him He is not wont to visit with punishment for
His own sake; for no harm can traverse that divine nature; but He acts with a view to our
advantage, and to prevent our perverseness becoming worse by our making a practice of
despising and neglecting Him. For even as one who places himself outside the light inflicts
no loss on the light, but the greatest upon himself being shut up in darkness; even so he who
has become accustomed to despise that almighty power, does no injury to the power, but
inflicts the greatest possible injury upon himself. And for this reason God threatens us with
punishments, and often inflicts them, not as avenging Himself, but by way of attracting us
to Himself. For a physician also is not distressed or vexed at the insults of those who are out
of their minds, but yet does and contrives everything for the purpose of stopping those who
do such unseemly acts, not looking to his own interests but to their profit; and if they
manifest some small degree of self-control and sobriety he rejoices and is glad, and applies
his remedies much more earnestly, not as revenging himself upon them for their former
conduct, but as wishing to increase their advantage, and to bring them back to a purely
sound state of health. Even so God when we fall into the very extremity of madness, says
and does everything, not by way of avenging Himself on account of our former deeds; but
because He wishes to release us from our disorder; and by means of right reason it is quite
possible to be convinced of this.</p>
<p>5. Now if any one should dispute with us concerning these things we will confirm them
out of the divine oracles. For who, I ask, became more depraved than the king of the Babylonians,
who after having received such great experience of God’s power as to make obeisance
to His prophet, and command offerings and incense to be sacrificed to Him was again carried
away to his former pride, and cast bound into the furnace those who did not honour himself
before God. Nevertheless this man who was so cruel and impious, and rather a beast than
a human being, God invited to repentance, and granted him several opportunities of conversion,
first of all the miracle which took place in the furnace, and after that the vision
which the king saw but which Daniel interpreted, a vision sufficient to bend even a heart of
stone; and in addition to these things after the exhortation derived from events the prophet
also himself advised him, saying “Therefore, O king, let my counsel please thee, and redeem
thy sins by alms, and thy iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; it may be that long suffering

<pb n="130"/>
will be shown to thy offence.”230 What sayest thou O wise and blessed man? After so great
a fall is there again a way of return? and after so great a disease is health possible? and after
so great a madness is there again a hope of soundness of mind? The king has deprived
himself beforehand of all hope, first of all by having ignored Him who created him; and
conducted him to this honour, although he had many evidences of His power and forethought
to recount which occurred both in his own case and in the case of his forefathers; but after
this again when he had received distinct tokens of God’s wisdom and foreknowledge, and
had seen magic, and astronomy and the theatre of the whole satanic system of jugglery
overthrown, he exhibited deeds yet worse than the former. For things which the wise magi,
the Gazarenes, could not explain, but confessed that they were beyond human nature, these
a captive youth having caused to be solved for him, so moved him by that miracle that he
not only himself believed, but also became to the whole world a clear herald and teacher of
this doctrine.231 Wherefore if even before having received such a token it was unpardonable
in him to ignore God, much more so was it after that miracle, and his confession, and the
teaching which was extended to others. For if he had not honestly believed that He was the
only true God he would not have shown such honour to His servant, or have laid down such
laws for others. But yet after making this kind of confession, he again lapsed into idolatry,
and he who once fell on his face and made obeisance to the servant of God, broke out into
such a pitch of madness, as to cast into the furnace the servants of God who did not make
obeisance to himself. What then? did God visit the apostate, as he deserved to be visited?
No! He supplied him with greater tokens of His own power, drawing him back again after
so great a display of arrogance to his former condition; and, what is yet more wonderful,
that owing to the abundance of the miracles he might not again disbelieve what was done,
the subject upon which He wrought the sign was none other than the furnace which the
king himself kindled for the children whom he bound and cast therein. Even to extinguish
the flame would have been a wonderful and strange thing; but the benign Deity in order to
inspire him with greater fear, and increase his dismay, and undo all his hardness of heart,
did what was greater and stranger than this. For, permitting the furnace to be kindled to as
high a pitch as he desired, He then exhibited his own peculiar power, not by putting down
the devices of his enemies, but by frustrating them when they were set on foot. And, to
prevent any one who saw them survive the flame from supposing that it was a vision, He
suffered those who cast them in to be burned, thus proving that the thing seen was really
fire; for otherwise it would not have devoured naphtha and tow, and fagots and such a large
number of bodies; but nothing is stronger than His command; but the nature of all existing
things obeys Him who brought them into being out of nothing; which was just what He
<note type="footnote">230 Dan. iv. 27.</note>
<note type="footnote">231 Dan. ii.</note>

<pb n="131"/>
manifested at that time; for the flame having received perishable bodies, held aloof from
them as if they had been imperishable, and restored in safety, with the addition of much
lustre, the deposit entrusted to it. For like kings from some royal court, even so did those
children come forth from the furnace, no one having the patience to look any longer at the
king, but all transferring their eyes from him to the strange spectacle, and neither the diadem
nor the purple robe, nor any other feature of royal pomp, attracted the multitudes of unbelievers
so much as the sight of those faithful ones, who tarried long in the fire, and then
came out of it as men might have done who had undergone this in a dream. For the most
fragile of all our features, I mean the hair, prevailed more mightily than adamant against
the all-devouring flame. And the fact that when they were cast into the midst of the fire they
suffered no harm was not the only wonder, but the further fact that they were speaking the
whole time. Now all who have witnessed persons burning are aware, that if they keep their
lips fast closed, they can hold out for a short time at least against the conflagration; but if
any one chances to open his mouth, the soul instantly takes its flight from the body. Nevertheless
after such great miracles had taken place, and all who were present and beheld were
amazed, and those who were absent had been informed of the fact by means of letters, the
king who instructed others remained himself without amendment, and went back again to
his former wickedness. And yet even then God did not punish him, but was still long-suffering,
counselling him both by means of visions and by His prophet. But when he was not
made anywise better by any of these things, then at last God inflicted punishment upon
him, not by way of avenging himself on account of his former deeds, but as cutting off the
occasion of future evils, and checking the advance of wickedness, and He did not inflict
even this permanently, but after having chastised him for a few years, He restored him again
to his former honour, without having suffered any loss from his punishment, but on the
contrary having gained the greatest possible good; a firm hold upon faith in God, and repentance
on account of his former misdeeds.232</p>
<p>6. For such is the loving-kindness of God; He never turns his face away from a sincere
repentance, but if any one has pushed on to the very extremity of wickedness, and chooses
to return thence towards the path of virtue, God accepts and welcomes, and does everything
so as to restore him to his former position. And He does what is yet more merciful; for even
should any one not manifest complete repentance, he does not pass by one which is small
and insignificant, but assigns a great reward even to this; which is evident from what Esaias
the prophet says concerning the people of the Jews, speaking on this wise: “On account of
his sin I put him to pain for a little while, and smote him, and turned my face away from
him, and he was pained, and walked sorrowfully, and then I healed him, and comforted
<note type="footnote">232 Dan. iv.</note>

<pb n="132"/>
him.”233 And we might cite as another witness that most ungodly king, who was given over
to sin by the influence of his wife: yet when he only sorrowed, and put on sackcloth, and
condemned his offences, he so won for himself the mercy of God, as to be released from all
the evils which were impending over him. For God said to Elias “Seest thou how Ahab is
pricked in the heart before my face? I will not bring the evil upon him in his own days, because
he hath wept before me.”234 And after this again, Manasses, having exceeded all in
fury and tyranny, and having subverted the legal form of worship, and shut up the temple,
and caused the deceit of idolatry to flourish, and having become more ungodly than all who
were before him, when he afterwards repented, was ranked amongst the friends of God.
Now if, looking to the magnitude of his own iniquities, he had despaired of restoration and
repentance, he would have missed all which he afterwards obtained: but as it was, looking
to the boundlessness of God’s tender mercy instead of the enormity of his transgressions,
and having broken in sunder the bonds of the devil, he rose up and contended with him,
and finished the good course.235 And not only by what was done to these men, but also by
the words of the prophet does God destroy the counsels of despair, speaking on this wise:
“To-day, if ye will hear His voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.”236 Now
that expression “to-day,” may be uttered at every time of life, even on the verge of old age,
if you desire it: for repentance is judged not by quantity of time, but by disposition of the
soul. For the Ninevites did not need many days to blot out their sin, but the short space of
one day availed to efface all their iniquity: and the robber also did not take a long time to
effect his entrance into Paradise, but in such a brief moment as one might occupy in uttering
a single word, did he wash off all the sins which he had committed in his whole life, and
received the prize bestowed by the divine approval even before the Apostles. And we also
see the martyrs obtain glorious crowns for themselves in the course, not of many years, but
of a few days, and often in a single day only.</p>
<p>7. Wherefore we have need of zeal in every direction, and much preparation of mind:
and if we so order our conscience as to hate our former wickedness, and choose the contrary
path with as much energy as God desires and commands, we shall not have anything less
on account of the short space of time: many at least who were last have far outstripped those
who were first. For to have fallen is not a grievous thing, but to remain prostrate after falling,
and not to get up again; and, playing the coward and the sluggard, to conceal feebleness of
moral purpose under the reasoning of despair. To whom also the prophet spoke in perplexity
<note type="footnote">233 Isa. lvii. 17, 18. LXX., which has after “sorrowfully” the words “in his ways.” I beheld his ways and healed
him, etc.</note>

<pb n="133"/>
saying “Doth he who falleth not rise up, or he who turneth away not turn back?”237 But if
you inquire of me for instances of persons who have fallen away after having believed, all
these things have been said with reference to such persons, for he who has fallen belonged
formerly to those who were standing, not to those who were prostrate; for how should one
in that condition fall? But other things also shall be said, partly by means of parables, partly
by plainer deeds and words. Now that sheep which had got separated from the ninety and
nine,238 and then was brought back again, represents to us nothing else than the fall and
return of the faithful; for it was a sheep not of some alien flock, but belonging to the same
number as the rest, and was formerly pastured by the same shepherd, and it strayed on no
common straying, but wandered away to the mountains and in valleys, that is to say some
long journey, far distant from the right path. Did he then suffer it to stray? By no means,
but brought it back neither driving it, nor beating it, but taking it upon his shoulders. For
as the best physicians bring back those who are far gone in sickness with careful treatment
to a state of health, not only treating them according to the laws of the medical art, but
sometimes also giving them gratification: even so God conducts to virtue those who are
much depraved, not with great severity, but gently and gradually, and supporting them on
every side, so that the separation may not become greater, nor the error more prolonged.
And the same truth is implied in the parable of the prodigal son as well as in this. For he
also was no stranger, but a son, and a brother of the child who had been well pleasing to the
father, and he plunged into no ordinary vice, but went to the very extremity, so to say, of
evil, he the rich and free and well-bred son being reduced to a more miserable condition
than that of household slaves, strangers, and hirelings. Nevertheless he returned again to
his original condition, and had his former honour restored to him. But if he had despaired
of his life, and, dejected by what had befallen him, had remained in the foreign land, he
would not have obtained what he did obtain, but would have been consumed with hunger,
and so have undergone the most pitiable death: but since he repented, and did not despair,
he was restored, even after such great corruption, to the same splendour as before, and was
arrayed in the most beautiful robe, and enjoyed greater honours than his brother who had
not fallen. For “these many years,” saith he “do I serve thee, neither transgressed I thy
commandment at any time, and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry
with my friends; but when this thy son is come who hath devoured thy living with harlots,
thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.”239 So great is the power of repentance.</p>
<p>8. Having then such great examples, let us not continue in evil, nor despair of reconciliation,
but let us say also ourselves “I will go to my Father,” and let us draw nigh to God. For

He Himself never turns away from us, but it is we who put ourselves far off: for “I am a
God” we read “at hand and not a God afar off.”240 And again, when He was rebuking them
by the mouth of this prophet He said “Do not your sins separate between you and me?”241
Inasmuch then as this is the cause which puts us far from God, let us remove this obnoxious
barrier, which prevents any near approach being made.</p>
<p>But now hear how this has actually occurred in real instances. Amongst the Corinthians
some man of mark committed a sin such as was not named even among the Gentiles. This
man was a believer and belonged to the household of Christ; and some say that he was actually
a member of the priesthood. What then? Did Paul cut him off from the communion of those
who were in the way of salvation. By no means: for he himself it is who rebukes the Corinthians
countless times, backwards and forwards, because they did not bring the man to a state
of repentance: but, desiring to prove to us that there is no sin which cannot be healed, he
said again concerning the man who had transgressed more grievously than the Gentiles:
“Deliver such an one to Satan for destruction of the flesh that his spirit may be saved in the
day of the Lord Jesus Christ.”242 Now this was prior to repentance: but after he had repented
“Sufficient,” said he, “for such an one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many243”
and he charged them by a letter to console the man again, and to welcome his repentance,
so that he should not be got the better of by Satan. Moreover when the whole Galatian people
fell after having believed, and wrought miracles, and endured many trials for the sake of
their faith in Christ he sets them up again. For that they had done miracles he testified when
he said: “He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit and worketh miracles among you:”244
and that they endured many contests for the sake of the faith, he also testified when he says:
“Have ye suffered so many things in vain if it be indeed in vain.”245 Nevertheless after
making so great an advance they committed sin sufficient to estrange them from Christ
concerning which he declares saying: “Behold, I Paul tell you, that if ye be circumcised,
Christ will profit you nothing:” and again “ye who would be justified by the law are fallen
away from grace:”246 and yet even after so great a lapse he welcomes them saying “my little
children of whom I am in travail again until Christ be formed in you247” showing that after

extreme perversion it is possible for Christ to be formed again in us: for He doth not desire
the death of a sinner, but rather that he should be convened and live.</p>
<p>9. Let us then turn to Him, my beloved friend, and execute the will of God. For He created
us and brought us into being, that He might make us partakers of eternal blessings, that He
might offer us the kingdom of Heaven, not that He might cast us into Hell and deliver us
to the fire; for this was made not for us, but for the devil: but for us the kingdom has been
destined and made ready of old time. And by way of indicating both these truths He saith
to those on the right hand, “Come ye blessed of my Father inherit the kingdom prepared
for you from the foundation of the world:” but to those on the left “Depart from me, ye
cursed, into fire everlasting prepared” (he no longer says “for you” but) “for the devil and
his angels.”248 Thus hell has not been made for us but for him and his angels: but the kingdom
has been prepared for us before the foundation of the world. Let us not then make ourselves
unworthy of entrance into the bride-chamber: for as long as we are in this world, even if we
commit countless sins it is possible to wash them all away by manifesting repentance for
our offences: but when once we have departed to the other world, even if we display the
most earnest repentance it will be of no avail, not even if we gnash our teeth, beat our breasts,
and utter innumerable calls for succour, no one with the tip of his finger will apply a drop
to our burning bodies, but we shall only hear those words which the rich man heard in the
parable “Between us and you a great gulf has been fixed.”249 Let us then, I beseech you, recover
our senses here and let us recognize our Master as He ought to be recognized. For
only when we are in Hades should we abandon the hope derived from repentance: for there
only is this remedy weak and unprofitable: but while we are here even if it is applied in old
age itself it exhibits much strength. Wherefore also the devil sets everything in motion in
order to root in us the reasoning which comes of despair: for he knows that if we repent
even a little we shall not do this without some reward. But just as he who gives a cup of cold
water has his recompense reserved for him, so also the man who has repented of the evils
which he has done, even if he cannot exhibit the repentance which his offences deserve, will
have a commensurate reward. For not a single item of good, however small it may be, will
be overlooked by the righteous judge. For if He makes such an exact scrutiny of our sins,
as to require punishment for both our words and thoughts, much more will our good deeds,
whether they be great or small, be reckoned to our credit at that day. Wherefore, even if
thou art not able to return again to the most exact state of discipline, yet if thou withdraw
thyself in a slight degree at least from thy present disorder and excess, even this will not be
impossible: only set thyself to the task at once, and open the entrance into the place of contest;
but as long as thou tarriest outside this naturally seems difficult and impracticable to thee.

`For before making the trial even if things are easy and manageable they are wont to present
an appearance of much difficulty to us: but when we are actually engaged in the trial, and
making the venture the greater part of our distress is removed, and confidence taking the
place of tremor and despair lessens the fear and increases the facility of operation, and makes
our good hopes stronger. For this reason also the wicked one dragged Judas out of this world
lest he should make a fair beginning, and so return by means of repentance to the point
from which he fell. For although it may seem a strange thing to say, I will not admit even
that sin to be too great for the succour which is brought to us from repentance. Wherefore
I pray and beseech you to banish all this Satanic mode of thinking from your soul, and to
return to this state of salvation. For if indeed I were commanding you to ascend to your
former altitude all at once, you would naturally complain of there being much difficulty in
doing this: but if all which I now ask you to do is to get up and return thence in the opposite
direction, why do you hesitate, and shrink, and make a retrograde movement? Have you
not seen those who have died in the midst of luxury and drunkenness, and sport and all the
other folly of this life? Where are they now who used to strut through the market place with
much pomp, and a crowd of attendants? who were clothed in silk and redolent with perfumes,
and kept a table for their parasites, and were in constant attendance at the theatre? What
has now become of all that parade of theirs? It is all gone;—the costly splendour of their
banquets, the throng of musicians, the attentions of flatterers, the loud laughter, the relaxation
of spirit, the enervation of mind, the voluptuous, abandoned, extravagant manner of life—it
has all come to an end. Where now have all these things taken their flight? What has become
of the body which enjoyed so much attention, and cleanliness. Go thy way to the coffin,
behold the dust, the ashes, the worms, behold the loathsomeness of the place, and groan
bitterly. And would that the penalty were limited to the ashes! but now transfer thy thought
from the coffin and these worms to that undying worm, to the fire unquenchable, to the
gnashing of teeth, to the outer darkness, to affliction and straitness, to the parable of Lazarus
and the rich man, who although the owner of so much wealth, and clothed in purple could
not become the owner of even a drop of water; and this when he was placed in a condition
of such great necessity. The things of this world are in their nature no-wise better than
dreams. For just as those who work in the mines or suffer some other kind of punishment
more severe than this, when they have fallen asleep owing to their many weary toils and the
extreme bitterness of their life, and in their dreams see themselves living in luxury and
prosperity, are in no wise grateful to their dreams after they have awaked, even so that rich
man having become rich in this present life, as it were in a dream, after his departure hence
was punished with that bitter punishment. Consider these things, and having contrasted
that fire with the conflagration of desires which now possesses thee, release thyself from the
furnace. For he who has thoroughly quenched this furnace here, will have no experience of
that in the other world: but if a man does not get the better of this furnace here, the other

<pb n="137"/>
will lay hold of him more vehemently when he has departed hence. How long a time dost
thou wish the enjoyment of the present life to be extended? For I do not suppose indeed
that more than fifty years remain to thee so as to reach extreme old age, nor indeed is even
this at all assured to us: for how should they who cannot be confident about living even to
the evening rely upon so many years as these? And not only is this uncertain, but there is
the uncertainty also of a change in our affairs, for often when life has been extended for a
long period, the conditions of luxury have not been extended with it, but have come, and
at the same time hastily departed. However, if you like, let it be granted for argument’s sake,
that you will live so many years, and will not sustain any reverse of fortune what is this
compared with the endless ages, and those bitter deed and intolerable punishments? For
here indeed both good and evil things have an end, and that very speedily: but there, both
are coextensive with immortal ages, and in their quality differ unspeakably from the things
which now are.</p>
<p>10. For when you hear of fire, do not suppose the fire in that world to be like this: for
fire in this world burns up and makes away with anything which it takes hold of; but that
fire is continually burning those who have once been seized by it, and never ceases: therefore
also is it called unquenchable. For those also who have sinned must put on immortality, not
for honour, but to have a constant supply of material for that punishment to work upon;
and how terrible this is, speech could never depict, but from the experience of little things
it is possible to form some slight notion of these great ones. For if you should ever be in a
bath which has been heated more than it ought to be, think then, I pray you, on the fire of
hell: or again if you are ever inflamed by some severe fever transfer your thoughts to that
flame, and then you will be able clearly to discern the difference. For if a bath and a fever
so afflict and distress us, what will our condition be when we have fallen into that river of
fire which winds in front of the terrible judgment-seat. Then we shall gnash our teeth under
the suffering of our labours and intolerable pains: but there will be no one to succour us:
yea we shall groan mightily, as the flame is applied more severely to us, but we shall see no
one save those who are being punished with us, and great desolation. And how should any
one describe the terrors arising to our souls from the darkness? for just as that fire has no
consuming power so neither has it any power of giving light: for otherwise there would not
be darkness. The dismay produced in us then by this, and the trembling and the great astonishment
can be sufficiently realized in that day only. For in that world many and various
kinds of torment and torrents of punishment are poured in upon the soul from every side.
And if any one should ask, “and how can the soul bear up against such a multitude of punishments
and continue being chastised through interminable ages,” let him consider what
happens in this world, how many have often borne up against a long and severe disease.
And if they have died, this has happened not because the soul was consumed but because
the body was exhausted, so that had the latter not broken down, the soul would not have

<pb n="138"/>
ceased being tormented. When then we have received an incorruptible and inconsumable
body there is nothing to prevent the punishment being indefinitely extended. For here indeed
it is impossible that the two things should coexist. I mean severity of punishment and permanence
of being, but the one contends with the other, because the nature of the body is
perishable and cannot bear the concurrence of both: but when the imperishable state has
supervened, there would be an end of this strife, and both these terrible things will keep
their hold upon us for infinite time with much force. Let us not then so dispose ourselves
now as if the excessive power of the tortures were destructive of the soul: for even the body
will not be able to experience this at that time, but will abide together with the soul, in a
state of eternal punishment, and there will not be any end to look to beyond this. How much
luxury then, and how much time will you weigh in the balance against this punishment and
vengeance? Do you propose a period of a hundred years or twice as long? and what is this
compared with the endless ages? For what the dream of a single day is in the midst of a
whole lifetime, that the enjoyment of things here is as contrasted with the state of things to
come. Is there then any one who, for the sake of seeing a good dream, would elect to be
perpetually punished? Who is so senseless as to have recourse to this kind of retribution?
For I am not yet accusing luxury nor revealing now the bitterness which lurks in it: for the
present is not the proper time for these remarks, but when ye have been able to escape it.
For now, entangled as you are by this passion, you will suspect me of talking nonsense, if I
were to call pleasure bitter: but when by the grace of God you have been released from the
malady then you will know its topics for another season, what I will say now is just this: Be
it so, that luxury is luxury, and pleasure, pleasure, and that they have nothing in them
painful or disgraceful, what shall we say to the punishment which is in store for us? and
what shall we do then if we have taken our pleasure now, as it were in a shadow and a figure,
but undergo everlasting torment there in reality, when we might in a short space of time
escape these tortures already mentioned, and enjoy the good things which are stored up for
us? For this also is the work of the loving-kindness of God, that our struggles are not protracted
to a great length, but that after struggling for a brief, and tiny twinkling of an eye
(for such is present life compared with the other) we receive crowns of victory for endless
ages. And it will be no small affliction to the souls of those who are being punished at that
time, to reflect, that when they had it in their power in the few days of this life to make all
good, they neglected their opportunity and surrendered themselves to everlasting evil. And
lest we should suffer this let us rouse ourselves while it is the accepted time, while it is the
day of salvation,250 while the power of repentance is great. For not only the evils already
mentioned, but others also far worse than these await us if we are indolent. These indeed,
and some bitterer than these have their place in hell: but the loss of the good things involves
<note type="footnote">250 2 Cor. vi. 2.</note>

<pb n="139"/>
so much pain, so much affliction and straitness, that even if no other kind of punishment
were appointed for those who sin here, it would of itself be sufficient to vex us more bitterly
than the torments in hell, and to confound our souls.</p>
<p>11. For consider I pray the condition of the other life, so far as it is possible to consider
it; for no words will suffice for an adequate description: but from the things which are told
us, as if by means of certain riddles, let us try and get some indistinct vision of it. “Pain and
sorrow and sighing,” we read “have fled away.”251 What then could be more blessed than
this life? It is not possible there to fear poverty and disease: it is not possible to see any one
injuring, or being injured, provoking, or being provoked, or angry, or envious, or burning
with any outrageous lust, or anxious concerning the supply of the necessaries of life, or bemoaning
himself over the loss of some dignity and power: for all the tempest of passion in
us is quelled and brought to nought, and all will be in a condition of peace, and gladness
and joy, all things serene and tranquil, all will be daylight and brightness, and light, not this
present light, but one excelling this in splendour as much as this excels the brightness of a
lamp. For things are not concealed in that world by night, or by a gathering of clouds: bodies
there are not set on fire and burned: for there is neither night nor evening there, nor cold
nor heat, nor any other variation of seasons: but the condition is of a different kind, such
as they only will know who have been deemed worthy of it; there is no old age there, nor
any of the evils of old age, but all things relating to decay are utterly removed, and incorruptible
glory reigns in every part. But greater than all these things is the perpetual enjoyment
of intercourse with Christ in the company of angels, and archangels, and the higher powers.
Behold now the sky, and pass through it in thought to the region beyond the sky, and consider
the transfiguration to take place in the whole creation; for it will not continue to be such as
it is now, but will be far more brilliant and beautiful, and just as gold glistens more brightly
than lead, so will the future constitution of the universe be better than the present: even as
the blessed Paul saith “Because the creation also itself shall be delivered from the bondage
of corruption.”252 For now indeed, seeing that it partakes of corruption, it is subject to many
things such as bodies of this kind naturally experience: but then, having divested itself of
all these things, we shall see it display its beauty in an incorruptible form: for inasmuch as
it is to receive incorruptible bodies, it will in future be itself also transfigured into the nobler
condition. Nowhere in that world will there be sedition and strife: for great is the concord
of the band of saints, all being ever in harmony with one another. It is not possible there to
fear the devil, and the plots of demons, or the threatenings of hell, or death, either that death
which now is, or the other death which is far worse than this, but every terror of this kind
will have been done away. And just as some royal child, who has been brought up in mean

<pb n="140"/>
guise, and subject to fear and threats, lest he should deteriorate by indulgence and become
unworthy of his paternal inheritance, as soon as he has attained the royal dignity, immediately
exchanges all his former raiment for the purple robe, and the diadem and the crowd of bodyguards,
and assumes his state with much confidence, having cast out of his soul thoughts
of humility and subjection, and having taken others in their place; even so will it happen
then to all the saints.</p>
<p>And to prove that these words are no empty vaunt let us journey in thought to the
mountain where Christ was transfigured: let us behold him shining as He shone there; and
yet even then He did not display to us all the splendour of the world to come. For that the
vision was accommodated to human eyes, and not an exact manifestation of the reality is
plain from the very words of the Evangelist. For what saith he? “He did shine as the Sun.”253
But the glory of incorruptible bodies does not emit the same kind of light as this body which
is corruptible, nor is it of a kind to be tolerable to mortal eyes, but needs incorruptible and
immortal eyes to contemplate it. But at that time on the mountain He disclosed to them as
much as it was possible for them to see without injuring the sight of the beholders; and even
so they could not endure it but fell upon their faces. Tell me, if any one led thee into some
bright place, where all were sitting arrayed in vestures of gold, and in the midst of the multitude
pointed out one other to thee who alone had garments wrought with precious stones,
and a crown upon his head, and then promised to place thee in the ranks of this people,
wouldst thou not do everything to obtain this promise? Open then even now in imagination
thine eyes, and look on that assembly, composed not of men such as we are, but of those
who are of more value than gold and precious stones, and the beams of the sun, and all visible
radiance, and not consisting of men only but of beings of much more dignity than
men,—angels, archangels, thrones, dominions, principalities, powers. For as concerning
the king it is not even possible to say what he is like: so completely do his beauty, his grace,
his splendour, his glory, his grandeur and magnificence elude speech and thought. Shall we
then, I ask, deprive ourselves of such great blessings, in order to avoid suffering for a brief
period? For if we had to endure countless deaths every day, or even hell itself, for the sake
of seeing Christ coming in His glory, and being enrolled in the company of the saints, ought
we not to undergo all those things? Hear what the blessed Peter says; “it is good for us to be
here.”254 But if he, when he beheld some dim image of the things to come, immediately cast
away all other things out of his soul on account of the pleasure produced in it by that vision;
what would any one say when the actual reality of the things is presented, when the palace
is thrown open and it is permitted to gaze upon the King Himself, no longer darkly, or by
means of a mirror,255 but face to face; no longer by means of faith, but by sight?</p>

<p>12. The majority it is true of those who are not very sensibly minded propose to be
content with escaping hell; but I say that a far more severe punishment than hell is exclusion
from the glory of the other world, and I think that one who has failed to reach it ought not
to sorrow so much over the miseries of hell, as over his rejection from heaven, for this alone
is more dreadful than all other things in respect of punishment. But frequently now when
we see a king, attended by a large bodyguard, enter the palace, we count those happy who
are near him, and have a share in his speech and mind, and partake of all the rest of his
glory; and even if we have countless blessings, we have no perception of any of them, and
deem ourselves miserable when we look at the glory of those who are round about him, although
we know that such splendour is slippery and insecure, both on account of wars, and
plots, and envy, and because apart from these things it is not in itself worthy of any consideration.
But where the king of all is concerned, he who holds not a portion of the earth but
the whole circuit of it, or rather who comprehends it all in the hollow of his hand, and
measures the Heavens with a span, who upholdeth all things by the word of His power,256
by whom all the nations are counted as nought, and as a drop of spittle;—in the case of such
a king I say shall we not reckon it the most extreme punishment to miss being enrolled in
that company which is round about him, but be content if we merely escape hell? and what
could be more pitiable than this condition of soul? For this king does not come to judge the
earth, drawn by a pair of white mules, nor riding in a golden chariot, nor arrayed in a purple
robe and diadem. How then does He come? Hear the prophets crying aloud and saying as
much as it is possible to tell to men: for one saith “God shall come openly, even our God
and shall not keep silence: a fire shall be kindled before Him, and a mighty tempest shall be
round about Him: He shall call the Heaven from above and the earth that He may judge
His people.”257 But Esaias depicts the actual punishment impending over us speaking thus:
“Behold the day of the Lord cometh, inexorable, with wrath and anger; to lay the whole
world desolate, and to destroy sinners out of it. For the stars of Heaven, and Orion, and the
whole system of the heaven shall not give their light, and the sun shall be darkened in its
going down,258 and the moon shall not give her light; and I will ordain evils against the
whole world, and visit their sins upon the ungodly, and I will destroy the insolence of the
lawless, and humble the insolence of the proud, and they who are left shall be more precious
than unsmelted gold, and a man shall be more precious than the sapphire stone. For the
heaven shall be disturbed259 and the earth shall be shaken from its foundations by reason
of the fury of the wrath of the Lord of Sabaoth, in the day when His wrath shall come upon

us.”260 And again “windows” he saith “shall be opened from the Heaven, and the foundations
of the earth shall be shaken: the earth shall be mightily confounded, the earth shall be bent
low, it shall be perplexed with great perplexity, the earth shall stagger grievously like the
drunkard and the reveller; the earth shall shake as a hut, it shall fall and not be able to rise
up again: for iniquity has waxed mighty therein. And God shall set His hand upon the host
of the Heaven in the height in that day, and upon the kingdoms of the earth, and He shall
gather together the congregation thereof into a prison, and shall shut them up in a stronghold.”
261 And Malachi speaking concordantly with these said “Behold the Lord almighty
cometh, and who shall abide the day of His coming or who shall stand when He appeareth?
for He cometh like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers soap: and He shall sit refining and purifying
as it were silver, and as it were gold.”262 And again, “Behold,” he saith, “the day of the Lord
cometh, burning like an oven, and it shall consume them, and all the aliens, and all who
work iniquity shall be stubble, and the day which is coming shall set fire to them saith the
Lord almighty; and there shall be left neither root nor branch.”263 And the man greatly beloved
saith “I beheld until thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days was seated, and his
raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head was pure as wool: His throne was a
flame of fire, and the wheels thereof burning fire: a stream of fire wound its way in front of
Him. Thousand thousands ministered unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand
stood before Him. The judgment was set and the books were opened.”264 Then after a little
space “I beheld,” he says, “in a vision of the night and behold with the clouds of Heaven,
one came like the Son of Man, and reached unto the Ancient of Days, and was brought near
before Him, and to Him was given rule, and honor, and the kingdom, and all the people,
tribes and tongues serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not
pass away, and His kingdom shall not be destroyed. As for me Daniel, my spirit shuddered
within me, and the visions of my head troubled me.”265 Then all the gates of the heavenly
vaults are opened, or rather the heaven itself is taken away out of the midst “for the heaven,”
we read “shall be rolled up like a scroll,”266 wrapped up in the middle like the skin and
covering of some tent so as to be transformed into some better shape. Then all things are
full of amazement and horror and trembling: then even the angels themselves are holden

by much fear, and not angels only but also archangels and thrones, and dominions, and
principalities and authorities. “For the powers” we read “of the heavens shall be shaken,”
because their fellow-servants are required to give an account of their life in this world.267
For if when a single city is being judged before rulers in this world, all men shudder, even
those who are outside the danger, when the whole world is arraigned before such a judge
as this who needs no witnesses, or proofs, but independently of all these things brings forward
deeds and words and thoughts, and exhibits them all as in some picture both to those who
have committed the sins and to those who are ignorant of them, how is it not natural that
every power should be confounded and shake? For if there were no river of fire winding by,
nor any terrible angels standing by the side of the throne, but men were merely summoned
some to be praised and admired, others to be dismissed with ignominy that they might not
see the glory of God, (“For let the ungodly” we read “be taken away that he may not see the
glory of the Lord”268) and if this were the only punishment would not the loss of such
blessings sting the souls of those who were deprived of them more bitterly than all hell itself?
For how great an evil this is cannot possibly be represented now in words; but then we shall
know it clearly in the actual reality. But now I pray add the punishment also to the scene,
and imagine men not only covered with shame, and veiling their heads, and bending them
low, but also being dragged along the road to the fire, and haled away to the instruments of
torture and delivered over to the cruel powers, and suffering these things just at the time
when all they who have practised what is good, and wrought deeds worthy of eternal life,
are being crowned, and proclaimed conquerors, and presented before the royal throne.</p>
<p>13. Now these are things which will happen in that day: but the things which will follow,
after these, what language can describe to us—the pleasure, the profit, the joy of being in
the company of Christ? For when the soul has returned to the proper condition of nobility,
and is able henceforth with much boldness to behold its Master it is impossible to say what
great pleasure it derives therefrom, what great gain, rejoicing not only in the good things
actually in hand, but in the persuasion that these things will never come to an end. All that
gladness then cannot be described in words, nor grasped by the understanding: but in a dim
kind of way, as one indicates great things by means of small ones, I will endeavour to make
it manifest. For let us scrutinize those who enjoy the good things of the world in this present
life, I mean wealth and power, and glory, how, exulting with delight, they reckon themselves
as no longer being upon the earth, and this although the things which they are enjoying are
acknowledged not to be really good, and do not abide with them, but take to flight more
quickly than a dream: and even if they should even last for a little time, their favour is displayed
within the limits of this present life, and cannot accompany us further. Now if these

<pb n="144"/>
things uplift those who possess them to such a pitch of joy, what do you suppose is the
condition of those souls which are invited to enjoy the countless blessings in Heaven which
are always securely fixed and stable? And not only this, but also in their quantity and quality
they excel present things to such an extent as never entered even the heart of man.269 For
at the present time like an infant in the womb, even so do we dwell in this world confined
in a narrow space, and unable to behold the splendour and the freedom of the world to
come: but when the time of travail arrives and the present life is delivered at the day of
judgment of all men whom it has contained, those who have been miscarried go from
darkness into darkness, and from affliction into more grievous affliction: but those which
are perfectly formed and have preserved the marks of the royal image will be presented to
the king, and will take upon themselves that service which angels and archangels minister
to the God of all. I pray thee then, O friend, do not finally efface these marks, but speedily
restore them, and stamp them more perfectly on thy soul. For corporeal beauty indeed God
has confined within the limits of nature, but grace of soul is released from the constraint
and bondage arising from that cause inasmuch as it is far superior to any bodily symmetry:
and it depends entirely upon ourselves and the grace of God. For our Master, being merciful
has in this special way honoured our race, that He has entrusted to the necessity of nature
the inferior things which contribute nothing much to our advantage, and in their issue are
matters of indifference, but of the things which are really noble He has caused us to be
ourselves the artificers. For if He had placed corporeal beauty also under our control we
should have been subjected to excessive anxiety, and should have wasted all our time upon
things which are of no profit, and should have grievously neglected our soul.</p>
<p>For if, even as it is, when we have not this power in ourselves, we make violent efforts,
and give ourselves up to shadow painting, and because we cannot in reality produce bodily
beauty, cunningly devise imitations by means of paints, and dyes, and dressing of hair, and
arrangement of garments, and pencilling of eyebrows, and many other contrivances: what
leisure should we have set apart for the soul and serious matters, if we had it in our power
to transfigure the body into a really symmetrical shape? For probably, if this were our business,
we should not have any other, but should spend all our time upon it: decking the
bondmaid with countess decorations, but letting her who is the mistress of this bond-maid
lie perpetually in a state of deformity and neglect. For this reason God, having delivered us
from this vain occupation, implanted in us the power of working upon the nobler element,
and he who cannot turn an ugly body into a comely one, can raise the soul, even when it
has been reduced to the extremity of ugliness, to the very acme of grace, and make it so
amiable and desirable that not only are good men brought to long after it but even He who
is the sovereign and God of all, even as the Psalmist also when discoursing concerning this
<note type="footnote">269 Isa. lxiv. 4, quoted in 1 Cor. ii. 9.</note>

<pb n="145"/>
beauty, said “And the king shall have desire of thy beauty.”270 Seest thou not also that in
the houses of prostitutes the women who are ugly and shameless would hardly be accepted
by prize-fighters, and runaway slaves, and gladiators: but should any comely, well-born and
modest woman, owing to some mischance, have been reduced to this necessity, no man,
even amongst those who are very illustrious and great, would be ashamed of marriage with
her? Now if there is so much pity amongst men, and so much disdain of glory as to release
from that bondage the women who have often been disgraced in the brothel, and to place
them in the position of wives, much more is this the case with God, and those souls which,
owing to the usurpation of the devil, have fallen from their original noble condition into
the harlotry of this present life. And you will find the prophets filled with examples of this
kind, when they address Jerusalem; for she fell into fornication, and a novel form of it, even
as Ezekiel says: “To all harlots wages are given, but thou hast given wages to thy lovers, and
there hath been perversion in thee beyond all other women,”271 and again another saith
“Thou didst sit waiting for them like a deserted bird.”272 This one then who hath committed
fornication in this fashion God calls back again. For the captivity which took place was not
so much by way of vengeance as for the purpose of conversion and amendment since if God
had wished to punish them outright, He would not again have brought them back to their
home. He would not have established their city and their temple in greater splendour than
before: “For the final glory of this house” He said “shall exceed the former.”273 Now if God
did not exclude from repentance her who had many times committed fornication, much
more will He embrace thy soul, which has now fallen for the first time. For certainly there
is no lover of corporeal beauty, even if he be very frantic, who is so inflamed with the love
of his mistress as God longs after the salvation of our souls; and this we may perceive both
from the things which happen every day and from the divine Scriptures. See at least, both
in the introduction of Jeremiah, and many other places of the prophets, when He is despised
and contemned, how He again hastens forward and pursues the friendship of those who
turn away from him; which also He Himself made clear in the Gospels saying, “O Jerusalem!
Jerusalem! thou that killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often
would I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her
wings, and ye would not?”274 And Paul writing to the Corinthians said “that God was in
Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, not reckoning their trespasses unto them, and
having committed unto us the word of reconciliation. We are ambassadors therefore on

behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us; we beseech you on behalf of Christ
be ye reconciled to God.”275 Consider that this has now been said to us. For it is not merely
want of faith, but also an unclean life which is sufficient to work this abominate enmity.
“For the carnal mind” we read “is enmity against God.”276 Let us then break down the barrier,
and hew it in pieces, and destroy it, that we may enjoy the blessed reconciliation, that
we may become again the fondly beloved of God.</p>
<p>14. I know that thou art now admiring the grace of Hermione, and thou judgest that
there is nothing in the world to be compared to her comeliness; but if you choose, O friend,
you shall yourself exceed her in comeliness and gracefulness, as much as golden statues
surpass those which are made of clay. For if beauty, when it occurs in the body, so fascinates
and excites the minds of most men, when the soul is refulgent with it what can match beauty
and grace of this kind? For the groundwork of this corporeal beauty is nothing else but
phlegm, and blood, and humor, and bile, and the fluid of masticated food. For by these
things both eyes and cheeks, and all the other features, are supplied with moisture; and if
they do not receive that moisture, daily skin becoming unduly withered, and the eyes sunken,
the whole grace of the countenance forthwith vanishes; so that if you consider what is stored
up inside those beautiful eyes, and that straight nose, and the mouth and the cheeks, you
will affirm the well-shaped body to be nothing else than a whited sepulchre; the parts within
are full of so much uncleanness. Moreover when you see a rag with any of these things on
it, such as phlegm, or spittle you cannot bear to touch it with even the tips of your fingers,
nay you cannot even endure looking at it; and yet are you in a flutter of excitement about
the storehouses and depositories of these things? But thy beauty was not of this kind, but
excelled it as heaven is superior to earth; or rather it was much better and more brilliant
than this. For no one has anywhere seen a soul by itself, stripped of the body; but yet even
so I will endeavour to present to you the beauty of this soul from another source. I mean
from the case of the greater powers. Hear at least how the beauty of these struck the man
greatly beloved; for wishing to set forth their beauty and being unable to find a body of the
same character, he had recourse to metallic substances, and he was not satisfied even with
these, but took the brilliancy of lightning for his illustration.277 Now if those powers, even
when they did not disclose their essential nature pure and bare, but only in a very dim and
shadowy way, nevertheless shone so brightly, what must naturally be their appearance, when
set free from every veil? Now we ought to form some such image of the beauty of the soul.
“For they shall be,” we read “equal unto the angels.”278 Now in the case of bodies the lighter

and finer kinds, and those which have retreated to the path which tend towards the incorporeal,
are very much better and more wonderful than the others. The sky at least is more
beautiful than the earth, and fire than water, and the stars than precious stones; and we admire
the rainbow far more than violets and roses, and all other flowers which are upon the
earth. And in short if it were possible with the bodily eyes to behold the beauty of the soul
you would laugh to scorn these corporeal illustrations, so feebly have they presented to us
the gracefulness of the soul. Let us not then neglect such a possession, nor such great happiness,
and especially when the approach to that kind of beauty becomes easy to us by our
hopes of the things to come. “For our light affliction,” we read, “which is but for the moment,
worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory, while we look not at
the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen
are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.”279 Now if the blessed Paul
called such afflictions as thou wottest of light and easy, because he did not look at the things
which are seen, much more tolerable is it merely to cease from wantonness. For we are not
calling thee to those dangers which he underwent, nor to those deaths which he incurred
daily,280 the constant beatings and scourgings, the bonds, the enmity of the whole world,
the hatred of his own people, the frequent vigils, the long journies, the shipwrecks, the attacks
of robbers, the plots of his own kinsfolk, the distresses on account of his friends, the hunger,
the cold, the nakedness, the burning, the despondency on account both of those who belonged
to him, and those who did not belong to him. None of these things do we now demand of
thee; all that we ask for is that you would release yourself from your accursed bondage, and
return to your former freedom, having considered both the punishment arising from your
wantonness, and the honor belonging to your former manner of life. For that unbelievers
should be but languidly affected by the thought of the resurrection and never be in fear of
this kind, is nothing wonderful; but that we who are more firmly persuaded concerning the
things of the other world than those of the present, should spend our life in this miserable
and deplorable way and be nowise affected by the memory of those things, but sink into a
state of extreme insensibility—this is irrational in the highest degree. For when we who believe
do the deeds of unbelievers, or rather are in a more miserable plight than they (for there are
some among them who have been eminent for the virtue of their life), what consolation,
what excuse will be left for us? And many merchants indeed who have incurred shipwreck
have not given way, but have pursued the same journey, and this when the loss which has
befallen them was not owing to their own carelessness, but to the force of the winds; and
shall we who have reason to be confident concerning the end, and know certainly that if we
do not wish it, neither shipwreck nor accident of any kind will bring us damage, not lay

hold of the work again, and carry on our business as we did aforetime, but lie in idleness
and keep our hands to ourselves? And would that we kept them merely to ourselves and did
not use them against ourselves which is a token of stark madness. For if any pugilist, leaving
his antagonist were to turn his hands against his own head, and deal blows to his own face,
should we not, I ask, rank him among madmen? For the devil has upset us and cast us down;
therefore we ought to get up, and not to be dragged down again and precipitate ourselves,
and add blows dealt by ourselves to the blows dealt by him. For the blessed David also had
a fall like that which has now happened to you; and not this only but another also which
followed it. I mean that of murder. What then? did he remain prostrate? Did he not immediately
rise up again with energy and place himself in position to fight the enemy? In fact
he wrestled with him so bravely, that even after his death he was the protector of his offspring.
For when Solomon had perpetrated great iniquity, and had deserved countless deaths, God
said that He would leave him the kingdom intact, thus speaking “I will surely rend the
kingdom out of thine hand and will give it to thy servant. Nevertheless I will not do this in
thy days.” Wherefore? “For David thy father’s sake, I will take it out of the hand of thy
son.”281 And again when Hezekiah was about to run the greatest possible risk, although he
was a righteous man, God said that He would succour him for the sake of this saint. “For I
will cast my shield” He saith, “over this city to save it for my own sake, and for my servant
David’s sake.”282 So great is the force of repentance. But if he had determined with himself,
as you do now, that henceforth it was impossible to propitiate God, and if he had said
within himself: “God has honoured me with great honour, and has given me a place among
the prophets, and has entrusted me with the government of my countrymen, and rescued
me out of countless perils, how then, when I have offended against Him after such great
benefits, and have perpetrated the worst crimes, shall I be able to recover his favour?” If he
had thought thus, not only would he not have done the things which he afterwards did, but
he would have aggravated his former evils.</p>
<p>15. For not only the bodily wounds work death, if they are neglected, but also those of
the soul; and yet we have arrived at such a pitch of folly as to take the greatest care of the
former, and to overlook the latter; and although in the case of the body it naturally often
happens that many wounds are incurable, yet we do not abandon hope, but even when we
hear the physicians constantly declaring, that it is not possible to get rid of this suffering by
medicines, we still persist in exhorting them to devise at least some slight alleviation; but in
the case of souls, where there is no incurable malady; for it is not subject to the necessity of
nature; here, as if the infirmities were strange we are negligent and despairing; and where
the nature of the disorder might naturally plunge us into despair, we take as much pains as

more account do we take of the body than of the soul. And this is the reason why we are
not able to save even the body. For he who neglects the leading element, and manifests all
his zeal about inferior matters destroys and loses both; whereas he who observes the right
order, and preserves and cherishes the more commanding element, even if he neglects the
secondary element yet preserves it by means of saving the primary one. Which also Christ
signified to us when He said, “Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the
soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Hell.”283</p>
<p>Well, do I convince you, that one ought never to despair of the disorders of the soul as
incurable? or must I again set other arguments in motion? For even if thou shouldst despair
of thyself ten thousand times, I will never despair of thee, and I will never myself be guilty
of that for which I reproach others; and yet it is not the same thing for a man to renounce
hope of himself, as for another to renounce hope of him. For he who has this suspicion
concerning another may readily obtain pardon; but he who has it of himself will not. Why
so pray? Because the one has no controlling power over the zeal and repentance of the other,
but over his own zeal and repentance a man has sole authority. Nevertheless even so I will
not despair of you; though you should any number of times be affected in this way; for it
may be, that there will be some return to virtue, and to restoration to thy former manner
of life. And now hear what follows: The Ninevites when they heard the prophet vehemently
declaring, and plainly threatening; “yet three days and Nineveh shall be overthrown,”284
even then did not lose heart, but, although they had no confidence that they should be able
to move the mind of God, or rather had reason to suspect the contrary from the divine
message (for the utterance was not accompanied by any qualification, but was a simple declaration),
even then they manifested repentance saying: “Who knoweth whether God will
repent and be entreated, and turn from the fierceness of His wrath, and that we perish not?
And God saw their works that they turned from their evil ways, and God repented of the
evil which He said He would do unto them and He did it not.”285 Now if barbarian, and
unreasoning men could perceive so much, much more ought we to do this who have been
trained in the divine doctrines and have seen such a crowd of examples of this kind both in
history and actual experience. “For my counsels” we read “are not as your counsels nor my
ways as your ways; but far as is the Heaven from the earth, so far are my thoughts from your
mind, and my counsels from your counsels.”286 Now if we admit to our favour household

slaves when they have often offended against us, on their promising to become better, and
place them again in their former portion, and sometimes even grant them greater freedom
of speech than before; much more does God act thus. For if God had made us in order to
punish us, you might well have despaired, and questioned the possibility of your own salvation;
but if He created us for no reason than His own good will, and with a view to our enjoying
everlasting blessings, and if He does and contrives everything for this end, from the
first day until the present time, what is there which can ever cause you to doubt? Have we
provoked Him severely, so as no other man ever did? this is just the reason why we ought
specially to abstain from our present deeds and to repent for the past, and exhibit a great
change. For the evils we have once perpetrated cannot provoke Him so much as our being
unwilling to make any change in the future. For to sin may be a merely human failing, but
to continue in the same sin ceases to be human, and becomes altogether devilish. For observe
how God by the mouth of His prophet blames this more than the other. “For,” we read, “I
said unto her after she had done all these deeds of fornication, return unto me, and yet she
returned not.”287 And again: from another quarter, when wishing to show the great longing
which He has for our salvation, having heard how the people promised, after many transgressions,
to tread the right way He said: “Who will grant unto them to have such an heart
as to fear me, and to keep my commandments all their days, that it may be well with them
and with their children forever?”288 And Moses when reasoning with them said, “And now,
O Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to
walk in all His ways, and to love Him?”289 He then who is so anxious to be loved by us, and
does everything for this end, and did not spare even His only begotten Son on account of
His love towards us, and who counts it a desirable thing if at any time we become reconciled
to Himself, how shall He not welcome and love us when we repent? Hear at least what He
says by the mouth of the prophet: “Declare thou first thy iniquities that thou mayest be
justified.”290 Now this He demands from us in order to intensify our love towards Him. For
when one who loves, after enduring many insults at the hands of those who are beloved,
even then does not extinguish his fondness for them, the only reason why he takes pains to
make those insults public, is that by displaying the strength of his affection he may induce
them to feel a larger and warmer love. Now if the confession of sins brings so much consolation,
much more does the endeavour to wash them away by means of our deeds. For if this
was not the case, but those who had once swerved from the straight path were forbidden to
return to it again, perhaps no one, except a few persons whose numbers would be easily

reckoned, would ever enter the kingdom of Heaven; but as it is we shall find the most distinguished
among those who have fallen. For those who have exhibited much vehemence
in evil things, will also in turn exhibit the same in good things, being conscious what great
debts they have incurred; which Christ also declared when He spoke to Simon concerning
the woman: “For seest thou,” saith He, “this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest
me no water for my feet; but she hath washed my feet with her tears, and wiped them with
the hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss, but she since the time I came in hath not
ceased to kiss my feet. Mine head with oil thou didst not anoint; but she hath anointed my
feet with ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee: her sins which are many are forgiven; for
she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. And He said unto her,
thy sins are forgiven.”291</p>
<p>16. For this reason also the devil, knowing that they who have committed great evils,
when they have begun to repent, do this with much zeal, inasmuch as they are conscious of
their offences, fears and trembles lest they should make a beginning of the work; for after
they have made it they are no longer capable of being checked, and, kindling like fire under
the influence of repentance, they render their souls purer than pure gold, being impelled
by their conscience, and the memory of their former sins, as by some strong gale, towards
the haven of virtue. And this is the point in which they have an advantage over those who
have never fallen, that they exercise more vehement energy; if only, as I said, they can lay
hold of the beginning. For the task which is hard and difficult of accomplishment is to be
able to set foot on the entrance, and to reach the vestibule of repentance, and to repulse and
overthrow the enemy there when he is fiercely raging and assaulting us. But after this, he
will not display so much fury when he has once been worsted, and has fallen where he was
strong, and we shall receive greater energy, and shall run this good race with much ease. Let
us then in future set about our return, let us hasten up to the city which is in Heaven, in
which we have been enrolled, in which also we have been appointed to find our home as
citizens. For to despair of ourselves not only has this evil that it shuts the gates of that city
against us, and that it drives us into greater indolence and contempt, but also that it plunges
us into Satanic recklessness. For the only cause why the devil became such as he is was that
he first of all despaired, and afterwards from despair sank into recklessness. For the soul,
when once it has abandoned its own salvation, will no longer perceive that it is plunging
downwards, choosing to do and say everything which is adverse to its own salvation. And
just as madmen, when once they have fallen out of a sound condition, are neither afraid nor
ashamed of anything, but fearlessly dare all manner of things, even if they have to fall into
fire, or deep water, or down a precipice; so they who have been seized by the frenzy of despair
are hence forward unmanageable, rushing into vice in every direction, and if death does not

<pb n="152"/>
come to put a stop to this madness, and vehemence, they do themselves infinite mischief.
Therefore I entreat you, before you are deeply steeped in this drunkenness, recover your
senses and rouse yourself up, and shake off this Satanic fit, doing it gently and gradually if
it be not possible to effect it all at once. For to me indeed the easier course seems to be to
wrench yourself once for all out of all the cords which hold you down, and transfer yourself
to the school of repentance. But if this seems to you a difficult thing, that you should be
willing to enter on the path which leads to better things, simply enter upon it, and lay hold
on eternal life. Yea, I beseech and implore you by your former reputation, by that confidence
which once was yours, let us see you once again standing on the pinnacle of virtue, and in
the same condition of perseverance as before. Spare those who are made to stumble on thy
account, those who are falling, who are becoming more indolent, who are despairing of the
way of virtue. For dejection now holds possession of the band of brethren, while pleasure
and cheerfulness prevail in the councils of the unbelieving, and of those young men who
are disposed to indolence. But if thou return again to thy former strictness of life the result
will be reversed, and all our shame will be transferred to them, while we shall enjoy much
confidence, seeing thee again crowned and proclaimed victor with more splendour than
before. For such victories bring greater renown and pleasure. For you will not only receive
the reward of your own achievements, but also of the exhortation and consolation of others,
being exhibited as a striking model, if ever any one should fall into the same condition, to
encourage him to get up and recover himself. Do not neglect such an opportunity of gain,
nor drag our souls down into Hades with sorrow, but let us breathe freely again, and shake
off the cloud of despondency which oppresses us on thy account. For now, passing by the
consideration of our own troubles, we mourn over thy calamities, but if thou art willing to
come to thy senses, and see clearly, and to join the angelic host, you will release us from this
sorrow, and will take away the greater part of sins. For that it is possible for those who have
come back again after repentance to shine with much lustre, and oftentimes more than those
who have never fallen at all, I have demonstrated from the divine writings. Thus at least
both the publicans and the harlots inherit the kingdom of Heaven, thus many of the last are
placed before the first.</p>
<p>17. But I will tell thee also of events which have happened in our own time, and of which
thou mayest thyself have been witness. You know probably that young Phoenician, the son
of Urbanus, who was untimely left an orphan, but possessed of much money, and many
slaves and lands. This man, having in the first place bidden complete farewell to his studies
in the schools, and having laid aside the gay clothing which he formerly wore, and all his
worldly grandeur, suddenly arraying himself in a shabby cloak, and retreating to the solitude
of the mountains, exhibited a high degree of Christian philosophy not merely in proportion
to his age, but such as any great and wonderful man might have displayed. And after this,
having been deemed worthy of initiation into the sacred mysteries, he made still greater

<pb n="153"/>
advances in virtue. And all were rejoicing, and glorifying God, that one nurtured in wealth,
and having illustrious ancestors, and being still a mere youth, should have suddenly trodden
all the pomps of this life under foot, and have ascended to the true height. Now which he
was in this condition, and an object of admiration, certain corrupt men, who according to
the law of kindred had the oversight of him dragged him back again into the former sea of
worldliness. And so, having flung aside all his habits, he again descended from the mountains
into the midst of the forum, and used to go all round the city, riding on horseback, and accompanied
by a large retinue; and he was no longer willing to live even soberly; for being
inflamed by much luxury, he was constrained to fall into foolish love intrigues, and there
was no one of those conversant with him, who did not despair of his salvation; he was encompassed
by such a swarm of flatterers, besides the snares of orphanhood, youth, and great
wealth. And persons who readily find fault with everything, accused those who originally
conducted him to this way of life,292 saying that he had both missed his spiritual aims, and
would no longer be of any use in the management of his own affairs, having prematurely
abandoned the labours of study, and having been consequently unable to derive any benefit
therefrom. Now while these things were being said, and great shame was felt, certain holy
men who had often succeeded in this kind of chase, and had thoroughly learned by experience
that those who are armed with hope in God ought not to despair at all of such characters,
kept a continual watch upon him, and if ever they saw him appear in the market place they
approached and saluted him. And at first he spoke to them from horseback, askance, as they
followed by his side; so great was the shamelessness which had at first got possession of him.
But they, being merciful and loving men, were not ashamed at all of this treatment, but
continually looked to one thing only, how they might rescue the lamb from the wolves;
which in fact they actually accomplished by means of their perseverance. For afterwards, as
if he had been converted by some sudden stroke, and were put to shame by their great assiduity,
if ever he saw them in the distance approaching, he would instantly dismount, and
bending low would listen silently in that attitude to all which fell from their lips, and in time
he displayed even greater reverence and respect towards them. And then, by the grace of
God having gradually rescued him out of all those entanglements, they handed him over
again to his former state of seclusion and devout contemplation. And now he became so illustrious,
that his former life seemed to be nothing in comparison with that which he lived
after his fall. For being well aware by experience of the snare, and having expended all his
wealth upon the needy, and released himself from all care of that kind, he cut off every
pretext for an attack from those who wished to make designs upon him; and now treading
the path which leads to heaven, he has already arrived at the very goal of virtue.</p>
<note type="footnote">292 i.e., the life of monastic seclusion.</note>

<pb n="154"/>
<p>This man indeed fell and rose again while he was still young; but another man, after
enduring great toils during his sojourn in the deserts, with only a single companion, and
leading an angelic life, and being now on the way to old age, afforded I know not how a little
loophole to the evil one, through some Satanic condition of mind, and carelessness; and although
he had never seen a woman since he transferred himself to the monastic life, he fell
into a passionate desire for intercourse with women. And first of all he besought his companion
to supply him with meat and wine, and threatened, if he did not receive it, that he
would go down into the marketplace. And this he said, not so much out of a longing for
meat, as because he wished to get some handle and pretext for returning into the city. The
other being perplexed at these things, and fearing, that if he hindered this he might drive
him into some great evil, suffered him to have his fill of this craving. But when his companion
perceived that this was a stale device, he openly threw off shame, and unmasked his pretence,
and said that he must positively himself go down to the city, and as the other had not power
to prevent him, he desisted at last from his efforts, and following him at a distance, watched
to see what the meaning of this return could possibly be. And having seen him enter a
brothel, and knowing that he had intercourse with a harlot there, he waited until he had
satiated that foul desire, and then, when he came out, he received him with uplifted hands,
and having embraced and fervently kissed him, without uttering any rebuke on account of
what had happened he only besought him, seeing that he had satiated his desire, to return
again to his dwelling in the wilderness. And the other, put to shame by his great clemency,
was immediately smitten at the heart of compunction for the deed which he had perpetrated,
followed him to the mountain; and there he begged the man to shut him up in another hut,
and, having closed the doors of the dwelling, to supply him with bread and water on certain
days, and to inform those who enquired for him that he was laid to rest. And when he had
said this, and persuaded him, he shut himself up, and was there continually, with fastings
and prayers and tears, wiping off from his soul the defilement of his sin. And not long after
when a drought had settled on the neighbouring region, and all in that country were
lamenting over it, a certain man was commanded by a vision to depart, and exhort this recluse
to pray, and put an end to the drought. And when he had departed, taking companions with
him, they found the man, who formerly dwelt with him, there alone; and on enquiring
concerning the other they were informed that he was dead. But they, believing that they
were deceived, betook themselves again to prayer, and again by means of the same vision
heard the same things which they had heard before. And then, standing round the man who
really had deceived them, they besought him to show the other to them; for they declared
that he was not dead but living. When he heard this, and perceived that their compact was
exposed, he brought them to that holy man; and they having broken through the wall (for
he had even blocked up the entrance) and having all of them entered, prostrating themselves
at his feet, and informing him of what had happened, besought him to succour them against

<pb n="155"/>
the famine. But he at first resisted, saying that he was far from such confidence as that; for
he ever had his sin before his eyes, as if it had only just taken place; but when they related
all which had happened to them they then induced him to pray; and having prayed he put
an end to the drought. And what happened to that young man who was at first a disciple of
John the son of Zebedee, but afterwards for a long time became a robber chief, and then
again, having been captured by the holy hands of the blessed Apostle returned from the
robber dens and lairs to his former virtue, thou art not ignorant, but knowest it all as accurately
as I do: and I have often heard thee admiring the great condescension of the saint, and
how he first of all kissed the blood-stained hand of the young man, embracing him, and so
brought him back to his former condition.293</p>
<p>18. Moreover also the blessed Paul not only welcomes Onesimus the unprofitable runaway
thief, because he was converted, but also asks his master to treat him who had repented,
on equal terms of honour with his teacher, thus saying: “I beseech thee for my son Onesimus,
whom I have begotten in my bonds, who was aforetime unprofitable to thee, but now is
profitable to thee and to me, whom I have sent back to thee; thou therefore receive him,
that is my very heart, whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might
minister unto me in the bonds of the Gospel; but without thy mind I would do nothing that
thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will. For perhaps he was therefore
parted from thee for a season that thou shouldest have him back for ever; no longer as a
servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially unto me; but how much rather to
thee both in the flesh and in the Lord? If then thou holdest me as a partner, receive him as
myself.”294 And the same apostle, in writing to the Corinthians, said, “Lest when I come I
should mourn over many of those who have sinned beforehand and have not repented;”295
and again, “as I have said beforehand, so do I again declare beforehand, that if I come again
I will not spare.”296 Seest thou who they are whom he mourns, and whom he does not spare?
Not those who have sinned, but those who have not repented, and not simply those who
have not repented, but those who have been called once and again to this work, and would
not be persuaded. For the expression “I have said beforehand and do now say beforehand,
as if I were present the second time, and being absent I write,” implies exactly that which
we are afraid may take place now in our case. For although Paul is not present who then
threatened the Corinthians, yet Christ is present, who was then speaking through his mouth;
and if we continue obdurate, He will not spare us, but will smite us with a mighty blow,

both in this world and the next. “Let us then anticipate His countenance by our confession,”
297 let us pour out our hearts before Him. For “thou hast sinned,” we read, “do not
add thereto any more, and pray on behalf of thy former deeds;”298 and again “a righteous
man is his own accuser in the first instance.”299 Let us not then tarry for the accuser, but
let us seize his place beforehand, and so let us make our judge more merciful by means of
our candour. Now I know indeed that you confess your sins, and call yourself miserable
above measure; but this is not the only thing I wish, but I long for you to be persuaded that
it can justify you. For as long as you make this confession unprofitable, even if you accuse
yourself, you will not be able to desist from the sins which follow it. For no one will be able
to do anything with zeal and the proper method, unless he has first of all persuaded himself
that he does it to advantage. For even the sower, after he has scattered his seed, unless he
expects the harvest, will never reap. For who would choose to fatigue himself in vain, if he
was not to gain any good from his labor? So then he also who sows words, and tears, and
confession, unless he does this with a good hope, will not be able to desist from sinning,
being still held down by the evil of despair; but just as that husbandman who despairs of
any crop of fruit will not in future hinder any of those things which damage the seeds, so
also he who sows his confession with tears, but does not expect any advantage for this, will
not be able to overthrow those things which spoil repentance. And what does spoil repentance
is being again entangled in the same evils. “For there is one” we read, “who builds, and one
who pulls down, what have they gained more than toil? He who is dipped in water because
of contact with a dead body, and then touches it again, what has he gained by his washing?”300
Even so if a man fasts because of his sins, and goes his way again, and doeth the same things,
who will hearken to his prayer? And again we read “if a man goes back from righteousness
to sin the Lord will prepare him for the sword,”301 and, “as a dog when he has returned to
his vomit, and become odious, so is a fool who by his wickedness has returned to his sin.”302</p>
<p>19. Do not then merely set forth thy sins being thy own accuser, but as one who ought
to be justified by the method of repentance; for thus thou wilt be able to put thy soul, which
makes its confession, to shame, so that it falls no more into the same sins. For to accuse
ourselves vehemently and call ourselves sinners is common, so to say, to unbelievers also.
Many at least of those who belong to the stage, both men and women, who habitually
practise the greatest shamelessness, call themselves miserable, but not with the proper aim.

Wherefore I would not even call this confession; for the publication of their sins is not accompanied
with compunction of soul, nor with bitter tears, nor with conversion of life, but
in fact some of them make it in quest of a reputation for the hearers for candor of speech.
For offences do not seem so grievous when some other person announces them as when
the perpetrator himself reports them. And they who under the influence of strong despair
have lapsed into a state of insensibility, and treat the opinion of their fellowmen with contempt
proclaim their own evil deeds with much effrontery, as if they were the doings of
others. But I do not wish thee to be any of these, nor to be brought out of despair to confession,
but with a good expectation, after cutting away the whole root of despair, to manifest
zeal in the contrary direction. And what is the root and mother of this despair? It is indolence;
or rather one would not call it the root only, but also the nurse and mother. For as in the
case of wool decay breeds moths, and is in turn increased by them; so here also indolence
breeds despair, and is itself nourished in turn by despair; and thus supplying each other
with this accursed exchange, they acquire no small additional power. If any one then cuts
one of these off, and hews it in pieces, he will easily be able to get the better of the remaining
one. For on the one hand he who is not indolent will never fall into despair, and on the
other he who is supported by good hopes, and does not despair of himself, will not be able
to fall into indolence. Pray then, wrench this pair asunder, and break the yoke in pieces, by
which I mean a variable and yet depressing habit of thought; for that which holds these two
things together is not uniform, but manifold in shame and character. And what is this? It
happens that one who has repented has done many great and good deeds, but meanwhile
he has committed some sin equivalent to those good deeds, and this especially is sufficient
to plunge him into despair, as if the buildings which had been set up were all pulled down,
and all the labor which he had bestowed upon them had been vain and come to naught. But
this must be taken into account, and such reasoning must be repelled, because, if we do not
store up in good time a measure of good deeds equivalent to the sins which are committed
after them, nothing can hinder us from sinking grievously and completely. But as it is, (right
action303) like some stout breastplate does not suffer the sharp and bitter dart to accomplish
its work, but even if it is itself cut through, it averts much danger from the body. For he who
departs to the other world with many deeds both good and bad, will have some alleviation
in respect of the punishment and the torment there; but if a man is destitute of these good
works, and takes only the evil with him, it is impossible to say what great sufferings he will
undergo, when he is conducted to everlasting punishment. For a balance will be struck there
between the evil deeds and those which are not such; and should the latter weigh down the
scale they will to no small extent have saved the doer of them, and the injury arising from
the doing of evil deeds is not so strong as to drag the man down from the foremost place;
<note type="footnote">303 These words seem to be understood, although they are not expressed in the original.</note>

<pb n="158"/>
but if the evil deeds exceed, they carry him off into hell fire, because the number of his good
actions is not so great as to be able to make a stand against this violent impulse. And these
things are not merely suggested by our own reasoning, but declared also by the divine oracles;
for He Himself saith, “He shall reward every man according to his works.”304 And not only
in hell, but also in the kingdom one will find many differences; for He saith “in my Fathers
house are many mansions;”305 and, “there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the
moon.”306 And what wonder, if in dealing with such great matters he has spoken with such
precision, seeing that He declares there is a difference in that world even between one star
and another? Knowing then all these things let us never desist from doing good deeds, nor
grow weary, nor, if we should be unable to reach the rank of the sun or of the moon, let us
despise that of the stars. For if only we display thus much virtue at least, we shall be able to
have a place in Heaven. And though we may not have become gold, or precious stone, yet
if we only occupy the rank of silver we shall abide in the foundation; only let us not fall back
again into that material which the fire readily devours, nor, when we are unable to accomplish
great things, desist also from small ones, for this is the part of extreme folly, which I trust
we may not experience. For just as material wealth increases if the lovers of it do not despise
even the smallest gains, so is it also with the spiritual. For it is a strange thing that the judge
should not overlook the reward of even a cup of cold water, but that we, if our achievements
are not altogether great, should neglect the performance of little things. For he who does
not despise the lesser things, will exercise much zeal concerning the greatest; but he who
overlooks the former will also abstain from the latter; and to prevent this taking place Christ
has defined great rewards even for these small things. For what is easier than to visit the
sick? Yet even this He requites with a great recompense. Lay hold then on eternal life, delight
in the Lord, and supplicate Him; take up again the easy yoke, bow thyself beneath the light
burden, put a finish to thy life worthy of the beginning; do not suffer so great a stream of
wealth to slip past thee. For if thou shouldst continue provoking God by thy deeds, thou
wilt destroy thyself; but if before much damage has been done, and all thy husbandry has
been overwhelmed with a flood, thou wilt dam up the channels of wickedness, thou wilt be
able to recover again what has been spoiled and to add to it not a little further produce.
Having considered all these things, shake off the dust, get up from the ground, and thou
wilt be formidable to the adversary; for he himself indeed has overthrown thee, as if thou
wouldst never rise again; but if he sees thee again lifting up thy hands against him, he will
receive such an unexpected blow that he will be less forward in trying to upset thee again,
and thou thyself wilt be more secure against receiving any wound of that kind in future. For

if the calamities of others are sufficient to instruct us, much more those which we have
ourselves undergone. And this is what I expect speedily to see in the case of thy own dear
self, and that by the grace of God thou art again become more radiant than before, and displaying
such great virtue, as even to be a protector of others in the world above. Only do
not despair, do not fall back; for I will not cease repeating this in every form of speech, and
wherever I see you, as well as by the lips of others; and if you listen to this you will no longer

<head>Letter II.</head>
<p>1. If it were possible to express tears and groans by means of writing I would have filled
the letter, which I now send to you, with them. Now I weep not because you are anxious
concerning your patrimony, but because you have blotted out your name from the list of
the brethren, because you have trampled upon the covenant which you had made with
Christ. This is the reason why I shudder, this is the cause of my distress. On this account
do I fear and tremble, knowing that the rejection of this covenant will bring great condemnation
upon those who have enlisted for this noble warfare, and owing to indolence have
deserted their proper rank. And that the punishment for such is heavier than for others is
manifest for this reason. For no one would indite a private individual for shunning military
service; but when once a man has become a soldier, if he be caught deserting the ranks, he
runs a risk of suffering the most extreme penalty. There is nothing strange, beloved Theodore,
in a wrestler falling, but in his remaining in a fallen condition; neither is it a grievous thing
for the warrior to be wounded, but to despair after the blow has been struck, and to neglect
the wound. No merchant, having once suffered shipwreck, and lost his freight, desists from
sailing, but again crosses the sea and the billows, and the broad ocean, and recovers his
former wealth. We see athletes also who after many falls have gained the wreath of victory;
and often, before now, a soldier who has once ran away has turned out a champion, and
prevailed over the enemy. Many also of those who have denied Christ owing to the pressure
of torture, have fought again, and departed at last with the crown of martyrdom upon their
brows. But if each of these had despaired after the first blow, he would not have reaped the
subsequent benefits. Even so now, beloved Theodore, because the enemy has shaken thee
a little from thy position, do not thou give thyself an additional thrust into the pit, but stand
up bravely, and return speedily to the place from which thou hast departed, and deem not
this blow, lasting but for a little while, any reproach. For if you saw a soldier returning
wounded from war you would not reproach him; for it is a reproach to cast away one’s arms,
and to hold aloof from the enemy; but as long as a man stands fighting, even if he be wounded
and retreat for a short time, no one is so unfeeling or inexperienced in matters of war, as to
find any fault with him. Exemption from wounds is the lot of non-combatants; but those
who advance with much spirit against the enemy may sometimes be wounded and fail;
which is exactly what has now occurred in your case; for suddenly, while you attempted to
destroy the serpent you were bitten. But take courage, you need a little vigilance, and then
not a trace of this wound will be left; or rather by the grace of God thou wilt crush the head
of the Evil One himself; nor let it trouble thee that thou art soon impeded, even at the outset.
For the eye, the keen eye of the Evil One perceived the excellence of thy soul, and guessed
from many tokens that a brave adversary would wax strong against him; for he expected
that one who had promptly attacked him with such great vehemence would easily overcome

<pb n="161"/>
him, if he persevered. Therefore he was diligent, and watchful, and mightily stirred up
against thee, or rather against his own head, if thou wilt bravely stand thy ground. For who
did not marvel at thy quick, sincere, and fervent change to good? For delicacy of food was
disregarded, and costliness of raiment was despised, all manner of parade was put down,
and all the zeal for the wisdom of this world was suddenly transferred to the divine oracles;
whole days were spent in reading, and whole nights in prayer; no mention was made of thy
family dignity, nor any thought taken of thy wealth; but to clasp the knees and hasten to the
feet of the brethren thou didst recognize as something nobler than high birth. These things
irritated the Evil One, these things stirred him up to more vehement strife; but yet he did
not give a deadly blow. For if after a long time, and continual fastings, and sleeping on the
bare ground and the rest of the discipline he overthrew you, even then there was no need
to despair; nevertheless one would have said that the damage was great if defeat had taken
place after many toils, and labour, and victories; but inasmuch as he upset you as soon as
you had stripped for the contest with him, all that he accomplished was to render you more
eager to do battle with him. For that fell pirate attacked thee just as thou wast sailing out of
the harbor, not when thou hadst returned from thy trading voyage, bringing a full cargo.
And as when one has attempted to stay a fierce lion, and has only grazed his skin, he has
done him no injury but only stirred him up the more against himself, and rendered him
more confident and difficult to capture afterwards: even so the common enemy of all has
attempted to strike a deep blow, but has missed it, and consequently made his antagonist
more vigilant and wary for the future.</p>
<p>2. For human nature is a slippery thing, quick to be cheated, but quick also to recover
from deceit and as it speedily falls, so also does it readily rise. For even that blessed man, I
mean David the chosen king and prophet, after he had accomplished many good deeds,
betrayed himself to be a man, for once he fell in love with a strange woman, nor did he stop
there but he committed adultery on account of his passion, and he committed murder on
account of his adultery; but he did not try to inflict a third blow upon himself because he
had already received two such heavy ones, but immediately hastened to the physician, and
applied the remedies, fasting, tears, lamentation, constant prayer, frequent confession of
the sin; and so by these means he propitiated God, insomuch that he was restored to his
former position, insomuch that after adultery and murder the memory of the father was
able to shield the idolatry of the son. For the son of this David, Solomon by name, was caught
by the same snare as his father, and out of complaisance to women fell away from the God
of his fathers.307 Thou seest how great an evil it is not to master pleasure, not to upset the
ruling principle in nature, and for a man to be the slave of women. This same Solomon then,
who was formerly righteous and wise but who ran a risk of being deprived of all the kingdom
<note type="footnote">307 1 Kings xi. 3, 4.</note>

<pb n="162"/>
on account of his sin, God permitted to keep the sixth part of the government on account
of the renown of his father.308</p>
<p>Now if thy zeal had been concerned with worldly eloquence, and then thou hadst given
it up in despair, I should have reminded thee of the law courts and the judgment seat and
the victories achieved there and the former boldness of thy speech, and should have exhorted
thee to return to your labours in that behalf: but inasmuch as our race is for heavenly things,
and we take no account of the things which are on earth, I put thee in remembrance of another
court of justice, and of that fearful and tremendous seat of judgment; “for we must
all be made manifest before the judgment seat of Christ.”309 “And He will then sit as judge
who is now disregarded by thee. What shall we say then, let me ask at that time? or what
defence shall we make, if we continue to disregard Him? What shall we say then? Shall we
plead the anxieties of business? Nay He has anticipated this by saying, “What shall it profit
a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?”310 Or that we have been deceived
by others? But it did not help Adam in his defence to screen himself behind his wife, and
say “the woman whom thou gavest me, she deceived me;”311 even as the serpent was no
excuse for the woman. Terrible, O beloved Theodore, is that tribunal, one which needs no
accusers and waits for no witnesses; for “all things are naked and laid open to Him”312 who
judges us, and we must submit to give an account not of deeds only but also of thoughts;
for that judge is quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.313 But perhaps you
will allege weakness of nature as the excuse, and inability to bear the yoke. And what kind
of defence is this, that you have not strength to bear the easy yoke, that you are unable to
carry the light burden? Is recovery from fatigue a grievous and oppressive thing? For it is
to this that Christ calls us, saying, “Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest; take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly
in heart; for my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”314 For what can be lighter I ask, than
to be released from anxieties, and business, and fears, and labors, and to stand outside the
rough billows of life, and dwell in a tranquil haven?</p>
<p>3. Which of all things in the world seems to you most desirable and enviable? No doubt
you will say government, and wealth, and public reputation. And yet what is more wretched
than these things when they are compared with the liberty of Christians. For the ruler is

subjected to the wrath of the populace and to the irrational impulses of the multitude, and
to the fear of higher rulers, and to anxieties on behalf of those who are ruled, and the ruler
of yesterday becomes a private citizen to-day; for this present life in no wise differs from a
stage, but just as there, one man fills the position of a king, a second of a general, and a third
of a soldier, but when evening has come on the king is no king, the ruler no ruler, and the
general no general, even so also in that day each man will receive his due reward not according
to the outward part which he has played but according to his works. Well! is glory a
precious thing which perishes like the power of grass? or wealth, the possessors of which
are pronounced unhappy? “For woe” we read, “to the rich;”315 and again, “Woe unto them
who trust in their strength and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches!”316 But
the Christian never becomes a private person after being a ruler, or a poor man after being
rich, or without honour after being held in honour; but he abides rich even when he is poor,
and is exalted when he strives to humble himself; and from the rule which he exercises no
human being can depose him, but only one of those rulers who are under the power of this
world’s potentate of darkness.</p>
<p>“Marriage is right,” you say; I also assent to this. For “marriage,” we read, “is honourable
and the bed undefiled; but fornicators and adulterers God will judge;”317 but it is no longer
possible for thee to observe the right conditions of marriage. For if he who has been attached
to a heavenly bridegroom deserts him, and joins himself to a wife the act is adultery, even
if you call it marriage ten thousand times over; or rather it is worse than adultery in proportion
as God is greater than man. Let no one deceive thee saying: “God hath not forbidden
to marry;” I know this as well as you; He has not forbidden to marry, but He has forbidden
to commit adultery, may you be preserved from ever engaging thyself in marriage! And why
dost thou marvel if marriage is judged as if it were adultery, when God is disregarded?
Slaughter has brought about righteousness, and mercy has been a cause of condemnation
more than slaughter; because the latter has been according to the mind of God but the
former has been forbidden. It was reckoned to Phinees for righteousness that he pierced to
death the woman who committed fornication, together with the fornicator;318 but Samuel,
that saint of God although he wept and mourned and entreated for whole nights, could not
rescue Saul from the condemnation which God issued against him, because he saved, contrary
to the design of God, the king of the alien tribes whom he ought to have slain.319 If then
mercy has been a cause of condemnation more than slaughter because God was disobeyed,

<pb n="164"/>
what wonder is it if marriage condemns more than adultery when it involves the rejection
of Christ? For, as I said at the beginning, if you were a private person no one would indict
you for shunning to serve as a soldier; but now thou art no longer thy own master, being
engaged in the service of so great a king. For if the wife hath not power over her own body,
but the husband,320 much more they who live in Christ must be unable to have authority
over their body. He who is now despised, the same will then be our judge; think ever on
Him and the river of fire: “For a river of fire” we read, “winds before His face;”321 for it is
impossible for one who has been delivered over by Him to the fire to expect any end of his
punishment. But the unseemly pleasures of this life no-wise differ from shadows and dreams;
for before the deed of sin is completed, the conditions of pleasure are extinguished; and the
punishments for these have no limit. And the sweetness lasts for a little while but the pain
is everlasting.</p>
<p>Tell me, what is there stable in this world? Wealth which often does not last even to the
evening? Or glory? Hear what a certain righteous man says: “My life is swifter than a runner.”
322 For as they dash away before they stand still, even so does this glory take to flight
before it has fairly reached us. Nothing is more precious than the soul; and even they who
have gone to the extremity of folly have not been ignorant of this; for “there is no equivalent
of the soul” is the saying of a heathen poet.323 I know that thou hast become much weaker
for the struggle with the Evil One; I know that thou art standing in the very midst of the
flame of pleasures; but if thou wilt say to the enemy “We do not serve thy pleasures, and we
do not bow down to the root of all thy evils;” if thou wilt bend thine eye upward, the Saviour
will even now shake out the fire, and will burn up those who have flung thee into it, and
will send to thee in the midst of the furnace a cloud, and dew, and a rustling breeze, so that
the fire may not lay hold of thy thought or thy conscience. Only do not consume thyself
with fire. For the arms and engines of besiegers have often been unable to destroy the fortification
of cities, but the treachery of one or two of the citizens dwelling inside has betrayed
them to the enemy without any trouble on his part. And now if none of thy thoughts within
betray thee, should the Evil One bring countless engines against thee from without he will
bring them in vain.</p>
<p>4. Thou hast by the grace of God many and great men who sympathize with thy trouble,
who encourage you to the fight, who tremble for thy soul,—Valerius the holy man of God,
Florentius who is in every respect his brother, Porphyrius who is wise with the wisdom of
Christ, and many others. These are daily mourning, and praying for you without ceasing;

and they would have obtained what they asked for, long ago, if only thou hadst been willing
to withdraw thyself a little space out of the hands of the enemy. Now then is it not strange
that, whilst others do not even now despair of thy salvation, but are continually praying that
they may have their member restored to them, thou thyself, having once fallen, art unwilling
to get up again, and remainest prostrate, all but crying aloud to the enemy: “Slay me, smite
me, spare not?” “Does he who falls not rise up again?”324 speaks the divine oracle. But thou
art striving against this and contradicting it; for if one who has fallen despairs it is as much
as to say that he who falls does not rise up again. I entreat thee do not so great a wrong to
thyself; do not pour upon us such a flood of sorrow. I do not say at the present time, when
thou hast not yet completed thy twentieth year, but even if, after achieving many things,
and spending thy whole life in Christ thou hadst, in extreme old age, experienced this attack,
even then it would not have been right to despair, but to call to mind the robber who was
justified on the cross, the labourers who wrought about the eleventh hour, and received the
wages of the whole day. But as it is not well that those who have fallen near the very extremity
of life should abandon hope, if they be sober minded, so on the other hand it is not safe to
feed upon this hope, and say, “Here for a while, I will enjoy the sweets of life, but afterwards,
when I have worked for a short time, I shall receive the wages of the whole working time.
For I recollect hearing you often say, when many were exhorting you to frequent the
schools;325 “But what if I bring my life to a bad end in a short space of time, how shall I depart
to Him who has said ‘Delay not to turn to the Lord, nor put off day after day?’”326 Recover
this thought, and stand in fear of the thief; for by this name Christ calls our departure hence,
because it comes upon us unawares. Consider the anxieties of life which befall us, both those
which are personal to ourselves, and which are common to us with others, the fear of rulers,
the envy of citizens, the danger which often hangs over us imperilling even life itself, the
labours, the distresses, the servile flatteries, such as are unbecoming even to slaves if they
be earnest minded men, the fruit of our labours coming to an end in this world, a fact which
is the most distressing of all. It has been the lot indeed of many to miss the enjoyment of
the things for which they have laboured, and after having consumed the prime of their
manhood in labours and perils, just when they hoped that they should receive their reward
they have departed taking nothing with them. For if, after undergoing many dangers, and
completing many campaigns, one will scarcely look upon an earthly king with confidence,
how will any one be able to behold the heavenly king, if he has lived and fought for another
all his time.</p>

<p>5. Would you have me speak of the domestic cares of wife, and children and slaves? It
is an evil thing to wed a very poor wife, or a very rich one; for the former is injurious to the
husband’s means, the latter to his authority and independence. It is a grievous thing to have
children, still more grievous not to have any; for in the latter case marriage has been to no
purpose, in the former a bitter bondage has to be undergone. If a child is sick, it is the occasion
of no small fear; if he dies an untimely death, there is inconsolable grief; and at every
stage of growth there are various anxieties on their account, and many fears and toils. And
what is one to say to the rascalities of domestic slaves? Is this then life, Theodore, when
one’s soul is distracted in so many directions, when a man has to serve so many, to live for
so many, and never for himself? Now amongst us, O friend, none of these things happen, I
appeal to yourself as a witness. For during that short time when you were willing to lift your
head above the waves of this world, you know what great cheerfulness and gladness you
enjoyed. For there is no man free, save only he who lives for Christ. He stands superior to
all troubles, and if he does not choose to injure himself no one else will be able to do this,
but he is impregnable; he is not stung by the loss of wealth; for he has learned that we
“brought nothing into this world, neither can we carry anything out;”327 he is not caught
by the longings of ambition or glory; for he has learned that our citizenship is in heaven;328
no one annoys him by abuse, or provokes him by blows; there is only one calamity for a
Christian which is, disobedience to God; but all the other things, such as loss of property,
exile, peril of life, he does not even reckon to be a grievance at all. And that which all dread,
departure hence to the other world,—this is to him sweeter than life itself. For as when one
has climbed to the top of a cliff and gazes on the sea and those who are sailing upon it, he
sees some being washed by the waves, others running upon hidden rocks, some hurrying
in one direction, others being driven in another, like prisoners, by the force of the gale, many
actually in the water, some of them using their hands only in the place of a boat and a rudder,
and many drifting along upon a single plank, or some fragment of the vessel, others floating
dead, a scene of manifold and various disaster; even so he who is engaged in the service of
Christ drawing himself out of the turmoil and stormy billows of life takes his seat upon secure
and lofty ground. For what position can be loftier or more secure than that in which a man
has only one anxiety, “How he ought to please God?”329 Hast thou seen the shipwrecks,
Theodore, of those who sail upon this sea? Wherefore, I beseech thee, avoid the deep water,
avoid the stormy billows, and seize some lofty spot where it is not possible to be captured.
There is a resurrection, there is a judgment, there is a terrible tribunal which awaits us when
we have gone out of this world; “we must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ.”330

It is not in vain that we are threatened with hell fire, it is not without purpose that such great
blessings have been prepared for us. The things of this life are a shadow, and more naught
even than a shadow, being full of many fears, and many dangers, and extreme bondage. Do
not then deprive thyself both of that world, and of this, when you may gain both, if you
please. Now that they who live in Christ will gain the things of this world Paul teaches us
when he says: “But I spare you;”331 and again “But this I say for your profit.”332 Seest thou
that even here he who cares for the things of the Lord is superior to the man who has married?
It is not possible for one who has departed to the other world to repent; no athlete, when
he has quitted the lists, and the spectators have dispersed, can contend again.</p>
<p>Be always thinking of these things, and break in pieces the sharp sword of the Evil One,
by means of which he destroys many. And this is despair, which cuts off from hope those
who have been overthrown. This is the strong weapon of the enemy, and the only way in
which he holds down those who have been made captives is by binding them with this chain,
which, if we choose, we shall speedily be able to break by the grace of God. I know that I
have exceeded the due measure of a letter, but forgive me; for I am not willingly in this
condition, but have been constrained by my love and sorrow, owing to which I forced myself
to write this letter also,333 although many would have prevented me. “Cease labouring in
vain and sowing upon rock” many have been saying to me. But I hearkened to none of them.
For there is hope I said to myself that, God willing, my letter will accomplish something;
but if that which we deprecate should take place, we shall at least have the advantage of escaping
self reproach for keeping silence, and we shall not be worse than sailors on the sea,
who, when they behold men of their own craft drifting on a plank, because their ship has
been broken to pieces by the winds and waves, take down their sails, and cast anchor, and
get into a boat and try to rescue the men, although strangers, known to them only in consequence
of their calamity. But if the others were unwilling to be rescued no one would accuse
those of their destruction who attempted to save them. This is what we offer; but we trust
that by the grace of God you also will do your part, and we shall again see you occupying
an eminent place in the flock of Christ. In answer to the prayers of the saints may we speedily
receive thee back, dear friend, sound in the true health. If thou hast any regard for us, and
hast not utterly cast us out of thy memory, please vouchsafe a reply to our letter; for in so
doing thou wilt give us much pleasure.</p>

LETTER TO A YOUNG WIDOW</p>

<head>INTRODUCTION TO THE LETTER TO A YOUNG WIDOW.</head>
<p>The date of the following letter can be determined within very narrow limits. It contains
a reference (c. 5) to the defeat and death of the Emperor Valens in the battle with the Goths
at Hadrianople, in a.d. 378, as a recent event. The Emperor who is described as having incessantly
engaged in war ever since his accession (c. 4) must be Theodosius, who succeeded
Valens, and as the Goths are said to be still overrunning large regions with impunity, and
insolently mocking the timidity of the imperial troops (ib.) the letter must have been written
prior to the crushing defeat which Theodosius inflicted on them in 382. The whole epistle
is deeply tinged with that profound sense of the unhappiness and instability of human life
which the moral corruption of society and recent calamities of the empire impressed with
peculiar force on the minds of men; producing too often amongst Pagans either a cynical
gloom or reckless indifference, but leading Christians to cling more closely and earnestly
to the hopes and consolations of the Gospel.</p>

<head>LETTER TO A YOUNG WIDOW.</head>
<p>1. That you have sustained a severe blow, and that the weapon directed from above has
been planted in a vital part all will readily admit, and none even of the most rigid moralists
will deny it; but since they who are stricken with sorrow ought not to spend their whole
time in mourning and tears, but to make good provision also for the healing of their wounds,
lest, if they be neglected their tears should aggravate the wound, and the fire of their sorrow
become inflamed, it is a good thing to listen to words of consolation, and restraining for a
brief season at least the fountain of thy tears to surrender thyself to those who endeavour
to console thee. On this account I abstained from troubling you when your sorrow was at
its height, and the thunderbolt had only just fallen upon you; but having waited an interval
and permitted you to take your fill of mourning, now that you are able to look out a little
through the mist, and to open your ears to those who attempt to comfort you, I also would
second the words of your handmaids by some contributions of my own. For whilst the
tempest is still severe, and a full gale of sorrow is blowing, he who exhorts another to desist
from grief would only provoke him to increased lamentations and having incurred his hatred
would add fuel to the flame by such speeches besides being regarded himself as an unkind
and foolish person. But when the troubled water has begun to subside, and God has allayed
the fury of the waves, then we may freely spread the sails of our discourse. For in a moderate
storm skill may perhaps play its part; but when the onslaught of the wind is irresistible experience
is of no avail. For these reasons I have hitherto held my peace, and even now have
only just ventured to break silence because I have heard from thy uncle that one may begin
to take courage, as some of your more esteemed handmaids are now venturing to discourse
at length upon these matters, women also outside your own household, who are your kinsfolk,
or are otherwise qualified for this office. Now if you allow them to talk to you I have the
greatest hope and confidence that you will not disdain my words but do your best to give
them a calm and quiet hearing. Under any circumstances indeed the female sex is the more
apt to be sensitive to suffering; but when in addition there is youth, and untimely widowhood,
and inexperience in business, and a great crowd of cares, while the whole life previously has
been nurtured in the midst of luxury, and cheerfulness and wealth, the evil is increased
many fold, and if she who is subjected to it does not obtain help from on high even an accidental
thought will be able to unhinge her. Now I hold this to be the foremost and greatest
evidence of God’s care concerning thee; for that thou hast not been overwhelmed by grief,
nor driven out of thy natural condition of mind when such great troubles suddenly concurred
to afflict thee was not due to any human assistance but to the almighty hand the understanding
of which there is no measure, the wisdom which is past finding out, the “Father of

<pb n="171"/>
mercies and the God of all comfort.”334 “For He Himself” it is said “hath smitten us, and
He will heal us; He will strike, and He will dress the wound and make us whole.”335</p>
<p>For as long as that blessed husband of thine was with thee, thou didst enjoy honour,
and care and zealous attention; in fact you enjoyed such as you might expect to enjoy from
a husband; but since God took him to Himself He has supplied his place to thee. And this
is not my saying but that of the blessed prophet David for he says “He will take up the
fatherless and the widow,”336 and elsewhere he calls Him “father of the fatherless and judge
of the widow;”337 thus in many passages thou wilt see that He earnestly considereth the
cause of this class of mankind.</p>
<p>2. But lest the continual repetition of this name of widow should upset thy soul, and
disconcert thy reason, having been inflicted on thee in the very flower of thy age, I wish first
of all to discourse on this point, and to prove to you that this name of widow is not a title
of calamity but of honour, aye the greatest honour. For do not quote the erroneous opinion
of the world as a testimony, but the admonition of the blessed Paul, or rather of Christ. For
in his utterances Christ was speaking through him as he himself said “If ye seek a proof of
Christ who is speaking in me?”338 What then does he say? “Let not a widow be enrolled
under threescore years of age” and again “but the younger widows refuse”339 intending by
both these sayings to indicate to us the importance of the matter. And when he is making
regulations about bishops he nowhere prescribes a standard of age, but in this case he is
very particular on the point, and, pray, why so? not because widowhood is greater than
priesthood, but because widows have greater labour to undergo than priests, being encompassed
on many sides by a variety of business public and private. For as an unfortified city
lies exposed to all who wish to plunder it, so a young woman living in widowhood has many
who form designs upon her on every side not only those who aim at getting her money but
also those who are bent upon corrupting her modesty. And besides these we shall find that
she is subjected to other conditions also likely to occasion her fall. For the contempt of servants
their negligence of business, the loss of that respect which was formerly paid, the sight
of contemporaries in prosperity, and often the hankering after luxury, induce women to
engage in a second marriage. Some there are who do not choose to unite themselves to men
by the law of marriage, but do so secretly and clandestinely. And they act thus in order to
enjoy the praise of widowhood; thus it is a state which seems to be not reproached, but ad-

mired and deemed worthy of honour among men, not only amongst us who believe, but
even amongst unbelievers also. For once when I was still a young man I know that the
sophist who taught me340 (and he exceeded all men in his reverence for the gods) expressed
admiration for my mother before a large company. For enquiring, as was his wont, of those
who sat beside him who I was, and some one having said that I was the son of a woman who
was a widow, he asked of me the age of my mother and the duration of her widowhood, and
when I told him that she was forty years of age of which twenty had elapsed since she lost
my father he was astonished and uttered a loud exclamation, and turning to those present
“Heavens!” cried he “what women there are amongst the Christians.” So great is the admiration
and praise enjoyed by widowhood not only amongst ourselves, but also a amongst
those who are outside the Church. And being aware of all this the blessed Paul said “Let not
a widow be enrolled under threescore years of age.” And even after this great qualification
of age he does not permit her to be ranked in this sacred society but mentions some additional
requisites “well reported of for good works, if she have brought up children if she
have lodged strangers if she have washed the saints feet if she have relieved the afflicted, if
she have diligently followed every good work.”341 Heavens! what testing and scrutiny! how
much virtue does he demand from the widow, and how precisely does he define it! which
he would not have done, had he not intended to entrust to her a position of honour and
dignity. And “the younger widows” he says “refuse;” and then he adds the reason: “for when
they have waxed wanton against Christ they will marry.”342 By this expression he gives us
to understand that they who have lost their husbands are wedded to Christ in their stead.
Observe how he asserts this by way of indicating the mild and easy nature of this union; I
refer to the passage “when they have waxed wanton against Christ they will marry,” as if He
were some gentle husband who did not exercise authority over them, but suffered them to
live in freedom. Neither did Paul confine his discourse on the subject to these remarks, but
also in another place again he has manifested great anxiety about it where he says “Now she
who liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth; but she who is a widow indeed and desolate
hath set her hope in God, and continueth in prayers and supplications day and night.”343
And writing to the Corinthians he says “But she is more blessed if she abide thus.”344 You
see what great praise is bestowed upon widowhood, and this in the New Testament, when
the beauty of virginity also was clearly brought to light. Nevertheless even the lustre of this
state could not obscure the glories of widowhood, which shines on brightly all the same,

keeping its own value. When then we make mention of widowhood from time to time, do
not be cast down, nor consider the matter a reproach; for if this be a matter of reproach, far
more so is virginity. But this is not the case; no! God forbid. For inasmuch as we all admire
and welcome women who live continently whilst their husbands are yet alive must we not
be delighted with those who manifest the same good feeling concerning their husbands
when they have departed this, life, and praise them accordingly? As I was saying then, as
long as you lived with the blessed Therasius you enjoyed honour and consideration such as
is natural for a wife to receive from a husband; but now in his place you have God who is
the Lord of all, who hath of old been thy protector and will be so now still more and with
yet greater earnestness; and as I have already said He hath displayed no slight token of his
providential care by having preserved thee whole and unharmed in the midst of such a
furnace of anxiety and sorrow, and not suffering thee to undergo anything undesirable.
Now if He has not permitted any shipwreck to take place in the midst of so much rough
water, much more will He preserve thy soul in calm weather and lighten the burden of thy
widowhood, and the consequences of it which seem to be so terrible.</p>
<p>3. Now if it is not the name of widow which distresses you, but the loss of such a husband
I grant you that all the world over amongst men engaged in secular affairs there have been
few like him, so affectionate, so gentle, so humble, so sincere, so understanding, so devout.
And certainly if he had altogether perished, and utterly ceased to be, it would be right to be
distressed, and sorrowful; but if he has only sailed into the tranquil haven, and taken his
journey to Him who is really his king, one ought not to mourn but to rejoice on these accounts.
For this death is not death, but only a kind of emigration and translation from the
worse to the better, from earth to heaven, from men to angels, and archangels, and Him
who is the Lord of angels and archangels. For here on earth whilst he was serving the emperor
there were dangers to be expected and many plots arising from men who bore ill-will, for
in proportion as his reputation increased did the designs also of enemies abound; but now
that he has departed to the other world none of these things can be suspected. Wherefore
in proportion as you grieve that God has taken away one who was so good and worthy you
ought to rejoice that he has departed in much safety and honour, and being released from
the trouble which besets this present season of danger, is in great peace and tranquillity. For
is it not out of place to acknowledge that heaven is far better than earth, and yet to mourn
those who are translated from this world to the other? For if that blessed husband of thine
had been one of those who lived a shameful life contrary to what God approved it would
have been right to bewail and lament for him not only when he had departed, but whilst he
was still living; but inasmuch as he was one of those who are the friends of God we should
take pleasure in him not only whilst living, but also when he has been laid to rest. And that
we ought to act thus thou hast surely heard the words of the blessed Paul “to depart and to

<pb n="174"/>
be with Christ which is far better.”345 But perhaps you long to hear your husband’s words,
and enjoy the affection which you bestowed upon him, and you yearn for his society, and
the glory which you had on his account, and the splendour, and honour, and security, and
all these things being gone distress and darken your life. Well! the affection which you be
stowed on him you can keep now just as you formerly did.</p>
<p>For such is the power of love, it embraces, and unites, and fastens together not only
those who are present, and near, and visible but also those who are far distant; and neither
length of time, nor separation in space, nor anything else of that kind can break up and
sunder in pieces the affection of the soul. But if you wish to behold him face to face (for this
I know is what you specially long for) keep thy bed in his honour sacred from the touch of
any other man, and do thy best to manifest a life like his, and then assuredly thou shalt depart
one day to join the same company with him, not to dwell with him for five years as thou
didst here, nor for 20, or 100, nor for a thousand or twice that number but for infinite and
endless ages. For it is not any physical relation, but a correspondence in the way of living
which qualifies for the inheritance of those regions of rest. For if it was identity of moral
constitution which brought Lazarus although a stranger to Abraham into the same heavenly
bosom with him, and qualifies many from east and west to sit down with him, the place of
rest will receive thee also with the good Therasius, if thou wilt exhibit the same manner of
life as his, and then thou shalt receive him back again no longer in that corporeal beauty
which he had when he departed, but in lustre of another kind, and splendour outshining
the rays of the sun. For this body, even if it reaches a very high standard of beauty is nevertheless
perishable; but the bodies of those who have been well pleasing to God, will be invested
with such glory as these eyes cannot even look upon. And God has furnished us with certain
tokens, and obscure indications of these things both in the Old and in the New Dispensation.
For in the former the face of Moses shone with such glory as to be intolerable to the eyes of
the Israelites, and in the New the face of Christ shone far more brilliantly than his. For tell
me if any one had promised to make your husband king of all the earth, and then had
commanded you to withdraw for twenty years on his account, and had promised after that
to restore him to you with the diadem and the purple, and to place you again in the same
rank with him, would you not have meekly endured the separation with due self-control?
Would you not have been well pleased with the gift, and deemed it a thing worth praying
for? Well then submit to this now, not for the sake of a kingdom on earth, but of a kingdom
in Heaven; not to receive him back clad in a vesture of gold but robed in immortality and
glory such as is fitting for them to have who dwell in Heaven. And if you find the trial very
unbearable owing to its long duration, it may be that he will visit you by means of visions
and converse with you as he was wont to do, and show you the face for which you yearn:

let this be thy consolation taking the place of letters, though indeed it is far more definite
than letters. For in the latter case there are but lines traced with the pen to look upon, but
in the former you see the form of his visage, and his gentle smile, his figure and his movements,
you hear his speech and recognize the voice which you loved so well.</p>
<p>4. But since you mourn also over the loss of security which you formerly enjoyed on
his account, and perhaps also for the sake of those great hopes of distinction which were
dawning (for I used to hear that he would speedily arrive at the dignity of præfect, and this,
I fancy, it is which more especially upsets and distresses thy soul) consider I pray the case
of those who have been in a higher official position than his, and yet have brought their life
to a very pitiable end. Let me recall them to your memory: you probably know Theodore
of Sicily by reputation:346 for he was one of the most distinguished men; he surpassed all
in bodily stature and beauty as well as in the confidence which he enjoyed with the Emperor,
and he had more power than any member of the royal household, but he did not bear this
prosperity meekly, and having entered into a plot against the Emperor he was taken prisoner
and miserably beheaded; and his wife who was not a whit inferior to thy noble self in education
and birth and all other respects was suddenly stripped of all her possessions, deprived
even of her freedom also, and enrolled amongst the household slaves, and compelled to lead
a life more pitiable than any bondmaid, having this advantage only over the rest that owing
to the extreme severity of her calamity she moved to tears all who beheld her. And it is said
also that Artemisia who was the wife of a man of high reputation, since he also aimed at
usurping the throne, was reduced to this same condition of poverty, and also to blindness;
for the depth of her despondency, and the abundance of her tears destroyed her sight; and
now she has need of persons to lead her by the hand, and to conduct her to the doors of
others that she may obtain the necessary supply of food.347 And I might mention many
other families which have been brought down in this way did I not know thee to be too pious
and prudent in disposition to wish to find consolation for thy own calamity out of the misfortunes
of others. And the only reason why I mentioned those instances to which I referred
just now was that you might learn that human things are nothingness but that truly as the
prophet says “all the glory of man is as the flower of grass.”348 For in proportion to men’s
elevation and splendour is the ruin wrought for them, not only in the case of those who are
under rule, but also of the rulers themselves. For it would be impossible to find any private
family which has been immersed in such great calamities as the ills in which the imperial

house has been steeped. For untimely loss of parents, and of husbands, and violent forms
of death, more outrageous and painful than those which occur in tragedies, especially beset
this kind of government.</p>
<p>Now passing over ancient times, of those who have reigned in our own generation, nine
in all, only two have ended their life by a natural death; and of the others one was slain by
a usurper,349 one in battle,350 one by a conspiracy of his household guards,351 one by the
very man who elected him, and invested him with the purple,352 and of their wives some,
as it is reported, perished by poison, others died of mere sorrow; while of those who still
survive one, who has an orphan son, is trembling with alarm lest any of those who are in
power dreading what may happen in the future should destroy him;353 another has reluctantly
yielded to much entreaty to return from the exile into which she had been driven by him
who held the chief power.354 And of the wives of the present rulers the one who has recovered
a little from her former calamities has much sorrow mingled with her joy because the possessor
of power is still young and inexperienced and has many designing men on all sides
of him;355 and the other is ready to die of fear, and spends her time more miserably than
criminals condemned to death because her husband ever since he assumed the crown up
to the present day has been constantly engaged in warfare and fighting, and is more exhausted
by the shame and the reproaches which assail him on all sides than by actual calamities.356
For that which has never taken place has now come to pass, the barbarians leaving their
own country have overrun an infinite space of our territory, and that many times over, and
having set fire to the land, and captured the towns they are not minded to return home
again, but after the manner of men who are keeping holiday rather than making war, they
laugh us all to scorn;357 and it is said that one of their kings declared that he was amazed at
the impudence of our soldiers, who although slaughtered more easily than sheep still expect
to conquer, and are not willing to quit their own country; for he said that he himself was

satiated with the work of cutting them to pieces. Imagine what the feelings of the Emperor
and his wife must be on hearing these words!</p>
<p>5. And since I have made mention of this war, a great crowd of widows has occurred to
me, who in past times derived very great lustre from the honour enjoyed by their husbands,
but now are all arrayed in a dark mourning robe and spend their whole time in lamentation.
For they had not the advantage which was enjoyed by thy dear self. For thou, my excellent
friend, didst see that goodly husband of thine lying on his bed, and didst hear his last words,
and receive his instructions as to what should be done about the affairs of the family, and
learn how by the provisions of his will they were guarded against every kind of encroachment
on the part of rapacious and designing men. And not only this, but also when he was yet
lying dead thou didst often fling thyself upon the body, and kiss his eyes, and embrace him,
and wail over him, and thou didst see him conducted to burial with much honour, and didst
everything necessary for his obsequies, as was fitting, and from frequent visits to his grave
thou hast no slight consolation of thy sorrow. But these women have been deprived of all
these things, having all sent out their husbands to war in the hope of receiving them back
again, instead of which it has been their lot to receive the bitter tidings of their death. Neither
has any one come back to them with the bodies of their slain, or bringing anything save a
message describing the manner of their death. And some there are who have not even been
vouchsafed this record, or been enabled to learn how their husbands fell, as they were buried
beneath a heap of slain in the thick of battle.</p>
<p>And what wonder if most of the generals perished thus, when even the Emperor himself
having been blockaded in a certain village with a few soldiers did not dare to go out and
oppose the assailants, but remained inside and when the enemy had set fire to the building
was burnt to death together with all that were therein, not men only, but horses, beams and
walls, so that the whole was turned into a heap of ashes? And this was the tale which they
who departed to war with the Emperor brought back to his wife in place of the Emperor
himself.358 For the splendours of the world differ in no-wise whatever from the things which
happen on the stage, and the beauty of spring flowers. For in the first place they flee away
before they have been manifested; and then, even if they have strength to last a little while,
they speedily become ready to decay. For what is more worthless than the honour and glory
which is paid by the multitude? what fruit has it? what kind of profit? what serviceable end
does it meet? And would that this only was the evil! but in fact besides failing to get anything
good from the possession, he who owns this most cruel mistress is continually forced to
bear much which is painful and injurious; for mistress she is of those who own her, and in
proportion as she is flattered by her slaves does she exalt herself against them, and ties them

down by increasingly harsh commands; but she would never be able to revenge herself on
those who despise and neglect her; so much fiercer is she than any tyrant and wild beast.
For tyrants and wild animals are often mollified by humouring, but her fury is greatest when
we are most complaisant to her, and if she finds any one who will listen to her, and yield to
her in everything there is no kind of command from which in future she can be induced to
abstain. Moreover she has also another ally whom one would not do wrong to call her
daughter. For after she herself has grown to maturity and fairly taken root amongst us, she
then produces arrogance, a thing which is no less able than herself to drive the soul of those
who possess it into headlong ruin.</p>
<p>6. Tell me then dost thou lament this that God hath reserved thee from such a cruel
bondage, and that He has barred every avenue against these pestilential diseases? For whilst
thy husband was living they ceased not continually assaulting the thoughts of thy heart, but
since his death they have no starting point whence they can lay hold of thy understanding.
This then is a discipline which ought to be practised in future—to abstain from lamenting
the withdrawal of these evils, and from hankering after the bitter tyranny which they exercise.
For where they blow a heavy blast they upset all things from the foundation and shatter
them to pieces; and just as many prostitutes, although by nature ill favoured and ugly, do
yet by means of enamels and pigments excite the feelings of the youthful whilst they are still
tender, and when they have got them under their control treat them more insolently than
any slave; so also do these passions, vainglory and arrogance, defile the souls of men more
than any other kind of pollution.</p>
<p>On this account also wealth has seemed to the majority of men to be a good thing; at
least when it is stripped of this passion of vainglory it will no longer seem desirable. At any
rate those who have been permitted to obtain in the midst of their poverty popular glory
have no longer preferred wealth, but rather have despised much gold when it was bestowed
upon them. And you have no need to learn from me who these men were, for you know
them better than I do, Epaminondas, Socrates, Aristeides, Diogenes, Krates who turned his
own land into a sheep walk.359 The others indeed, inasmuch as it was not possible for them
to get rich, saw glory brought to them in the midst of their poverty, and straightway devoted
themselves to it, but this man threw away even what he possessed; so infatuated were they
in the pursuit of this cruel monster. Let us not then weep because God has rescued us from
this shameful thraldom which is an object of derision and of much reproach; for there is
nothing splendid in it save the name it bears, and in reality it places those who possess it in
a position which belies its appellation, and there is no one who does not laugh to scorn the

man who does anything with a view to glory. For it is only he who has not an eye to this
who will be enabled to win respect and glory; but he who sets a great value on popular glory,
and does and endures everything for the sake of obtaining it is the very man who will fail
to attain it, and be subjected to all the exact opposites of glory, ridicule, and accusation,
scoffing, enmity and hatred. And this is wont to happen not only among men, but also
among you women, and indeed more especially in your case. For the woman who is unaffected
in mien, and gait, and dress, and seeks no honour from any one is admired by all
women, and they are ecstatic in their praise and call her blessed, and invoke all manner of
good things upon her; but a vain-glorious woman they behold with aversion and detestation,
and avoid her like some wild beast and load her with infinite execrations and abuse. And
not only do we escape these evils by refusing to accept popular glory, but we shall gain the
highest advantages in addition to those which have been already mentioned, being trained
gradually to loosen our hold of earth and move in the direction of heaven, and despise all
worldly things. For he who feels no need of the honour which comes from men, will perform
with security whatever good things he does, and neither in the troubles, nor in the
prosperities of this life will he be very seriously affected; for neither can the former depress
him, and cast him down, nor can the latter elate and puff him up, but in precarious and
troubled circumstances he himself remains exempt from change of any kind. And this I
expect will speedily be the case with your own soul, and having once for all torn yourself
away from all worldly interests you will display amongst us a heavenly manner of life, and
in a little while will laugh to scorn the glory which you now lament, and despise its hollow
and vain mask. But if you long for the security which you formerly enjoyed owing to your
husband, and the protection of your property, and immunity from the designs of any of
those persons who trample upon the misfortunes of others “Cast thy care upon the Lord
and He will nourish thee.”360 “For look,” it is said, “to past generations and see, who ever
placed his hope on the Lord and was put to shame, or who ever called upon Him, and was
neglected, or who ever remained constant to His commandments and was forsaken?”361
For He who has alleviated this intolerable calamity, and placed you even now in a state of
tranquillity will also avert impending evils; for that you will never receive another blow
more severe than this you would yourself admit. Having then so bravely borne present
troubles, and this when you were inexperienced, you will far more easily endure future
events should any of the things contrary to our wishes, which God forbid, occur. Therefore
seek Heaven, and all things which conduce to life in the other world, and none of the things
here will be able to harm thee, not even the world-ruler of darkness himself, if only we do

not injure ourselves. For if any one deprives us of our substance, or hews our body in pieces,
none of these things concern us, if our soul abides in its integrity.</p>
<p>7. Now, once for all, if you wish your property to abide with you in security and yet
further to increase I will show thee the plan, and the place where none of those who have
designs upon it will be allowed to enter. What then is the place? It is Heaven. Send away thy
possessions to that good husband of thine and neither thief, nor schemer, nor any other
destructive thing will be able to pounce upon them. If you deposit these goods in the other
world, you will find much profit arising from them. For all things which we plant in Heaven
yield a large and abundant crop, such as might naturally be expected from things which
have their roots in Heaven. And if you do this, see what blessings you will enjoy, in the first
place eternal life and the things promised to those who love God, “which eye hath not seen,
nor ear heard, neither have they entered into the heart of man,” and in the second place
perpetual intercourse with thy good husband; and you will relieve yourself from the cares
and fears, and dangers, and designs, and enmity and hatred which beset you here. For as
long as you are surrounded with this property there will probably be some to make attempts
upon it; but if you transfer it to Heaven, you will lead a life of security and safety, and much
tranquillity, enjoying independence combined with godliness. For it is very irrational, when
one wishes to buy land, and is seeking for productive ground, if, Heaven being proposed to
him instead of earth, and the possibility presented of obtaining an estate there he abides
still on earth, and puts up with the toils that are connected with it; for it often disappoints
our hopes.</p>
<p>But since thy soul is grievously upset and vexed on account of the expectation often
entertained that thy husband would attain the rank of prefect, and the thought that he was
untimely snatched away from that dignity consider first of all this fact, that even if this hope
was a very well grounded one nevertheless it was only a human hope, which often falls to
the ground; and we see many things of this kind happening in life, those which were confidently
expected having remained unfulfilled, whereas those which never even entered the
mind have frequently come to pass, and this we constantly see occurring everywhere in
cases of governments and kingdoms, and inheritances, and marriages. Wherefore even if
the opportunity were very near at hand, yet as the proverb says “between the cup and the
lip there is many a slip” and the Scripture saith “from the morning until the evening the
time is changed.”362</p>
<p>So also a king who is here to-day is dead tomorrow; and again this same wise man illustrating
the reversal of men’s hopes says “many tyrants have sat down upon the ground, and
one that was never thought of has worn the crown.”363 And it was not absolutely certain
<note type="footnote">362 Ecclus. xviii. 26.</note>
<note type="footnote">363 Ecclus. xi. 5.</note>

<pb n="181"/>
that if he lived he would arrive at this dignity; for that which belongs to the future is uncertain,
and causes us to have various suspicions. For on what grounds was it evident that had he
lived he would have attained that dignity and that things would not have turned out the
other way, and that he would have lost the office he actually held either from falling a victim
to disease, or from being exposed to the envy and ill will of those who wished to excel him
in prosperity, or from suffering some other grievous misfortune. But let us suppose, if you
please, that it was perfectly evident that in any case had he survived he would have obtained
this high distinction; then in proportion to the magnitude of the dignity would have been
the increased dangers, and anxieties, and intrigues which he must have encountered. Or
put these even on one side, and let us suppose him to traverse that sea of difficulties safely,
and in much tranquillity; then tell me what is the goal? not that which he has now reached;
no, not that, but something different, probably unpleasant and undesirable. In the first place
his sight of heaven, and heavenly things would have been delayed, which is no small loss to
those who have put their trust in things to come; and in the next place, even had he lived a
very pure life yet the length of his life and the exigencies of his high office would have prevented
his departing in such a pure condition as has now been the case. In fact it is uncertain
whether he might not have undergone many changes and given way to indolence before he
breathed his last. For now we are confident that by the grace of God he has taken his flight
to the region of rest, because he had not committed himself to any of those deeds which
exclude from the kingdom of Heaven; but in that case after long contact with public busi
ness, he might probably have contracted great defilement. For it is an exceedingly rare thing
for one who is moving in the midst of such great evils to hold a straight course, but to go
astray, both wittingly and against his will, is a natural thing, and one which constantly occurs.
But, as it is, we have been relieved from this apprehension, and we are firmly persuaded that
in the great day he will appear in much radiance, shining forth near the King, and going
with the angels in advance of Christ and clad with the robe of unutterable glory, and
standing by the side of the King as he gives judgment, and acting as one of His chief ministers.
Wherefore desisting from mourning and lamentation do thou hold on to the same way of
life as his, yea even let it be more exact, that having speedily attained an equal standard of
virtue with him, you may inhabit the same abode and be united to him again through the
everlasting ages, not in this union of marriage but another far better. For this is only a bodily
kind of intercourse, but then there will be a union of soul with soul more perfect, and of a
far more delightful and far nobler kind.</p>

<pb n="183"/>
<head>INTRODUCTION TO THE HOMILIES ON S. IGNATIUS AND
S. BABYLAS.</head>
<p>The following have been selected out of a large number delivered by Chrysostom on
the festivals of saints and martyrs, not only because they are good samples of his discourses
on such occasions, but also on account of the celebrity of the two saints in whose honour
they were spoken. There is really very little known about Ignatius beyond the fact that he
was Bishop of Antioch, and suffered martyrdom at Rome in the reign of Trajan about the
year 110 a.d.: being torn to death by wild beasts in the colossal amphitheatre erected for
the display of such inhuman sports by the emperors of the Flavian dynasty. The tradition
that he was a disciple of St. John does not rest on any trustworthy evidence, but on the other
hand there is nothing inherently impossible or even improbable in the supposition.</p>
<p>According to a tradition which cannot be traced back earlier than the latter part of the
fourth century the reliques were translated from Rome to Antioch and deposited in the
Christian cemetery outside the gates called the Daphnitic gate, because it led from the city
to the famous suburb of Daphne, on which we shall have more to say presently. It is clear
from the following eulogy that Chrysostom accepted this tradition, and his repeated invitation
to his hearers to “come hither” to enjoy the beneficent influence of the saint seems to imply
that his discourse was delivered in the “martyr,” that is the chapel erected to contain the
martyr’s remains, not in the “Great Church” of Antioch where he commonly preached. In
the next generation the reliques of the saint were again translated by the Emperor, the
younger Theodosius, to the building which had been the temple of the “Fortune of Antioch,”
and then the illustrious Christian martyr was substituted for the mythical goddess on the
tutelary genius of the city.</p>
<p>The fame of S. Babylas rivalled and for a time almost threatened to overshadow that of
S. Ignatius. He had been Bishop of Antioch about 237 to 250. The heroic courage with which
he had once repulsed the Emperor Philip from the church until he should have submitted
to penance for some offence committed, and his martyrdom in the persecution under Decius
were his original claims to popular veneration. But some later events shed a fresh lustre on
his name. In the year 351 the Cæsar Gallus, brother of Julian, being resident in Antioch,
transferred the reliques of Babylas from their resting place within the city to the beautiful
suburb the garden or grove of Daphne. “In the history of this spot we have a singular instance
of the way in which Grecian legend was transplanted into foreign soil. Daphne the daughter
of the river-god Ladon were according to the Syrian version of the myth, overtaken by her
lover Apollo near Antioch. Here it was, on the banks not of the Peneus but of the Oronete,
that the maiden prayed to her mother earth to open her arms and shelter her from the
pursuit of the amorous god, and that the laurel plant sprang out of the spot where she vanished
from the eyes of her disappointed lover. The house of Seleucus Nicator, founder of

<pb n="184"/>
the Syrian monarchy was said to have struck his hoof upon one of the arrows dropped by
Apollo in the hurry of his pursuit; in consequence of which the king dedicated the place to
the god. A temple was erected in his honour, ample in its proportions, sumptuous in its
adornments; the internal walls were resplendent with polished marbles, the lofty ceiling was
of cypress wood. The colossal image of the god, enriched with gold and gems, nearly reached
the top of the roof. <gap reason="omitted"/> With one hand the deity lightly touched the lyre which hung from
his shoulders and in the other he held a golden dish, as if about to pour a libation on the
earth “and supplicate the venerable mother to give to his arms the cold and beauteous
Daphne.”364 The whole grove became consecrated to pleasure under the guise of festivity
in honor of the god. <gap reason="omitted"/> It contained everything which could gratify and charm the senses;
the deep impenetrable shade of cypress trees, the delicious noise and coolness of falling
waters, the fragrance of aromatic shrubs; there were also baths, and grottos, porticoes, and
colonnades. Such materials for voluptuous enjoyment told with fatal effect upon the morals
of a people addicted at all times to an immoderate indulgence in luxurious pleasure.365
Daphne became one of those places where gross and shameless vice was practised under
the sanction of religion. The intention of Cæsar Gallus in translating the reliques of Babylas
to Daphne was as Chrysostom expresses it to “bring a physician to the sick;” to introduce
a pure and Christian association into a spot hitherto consecrated to Pagan and licentious
rites. The bones of the saint were laid near the shrine of Apollo, and the Christian church
standing hard by the heathen temple was a visible warning to any Christian who might visit
the place to abstain from deeds abhorrent to the faith for which the bishop had died. But
the remains of the martyr were not permitted to rest in peace. When the Emperor Julian
visited Antioch 362, he consulted the oracle of Apollo at Daphne respecting the issue of the
expedition which he was about to make into Persia. But the oracle was dumb. At length the
god yielded to the importunity of prayers and sacrifices so far as to explain the cause of his
silence. He was offended by the proximity of dead men. “Break open the sepulchres, take
up the bones, and carry them hence.” No name was mentioned, but the demand was interpreted
as referring to the remains of Babylas, and the wishes of the affronted deity were
complied with. The Christians were commanded by Julian to remove the bones of their
saint from the neighbourhood of Apollo’s sanctuary. They obeyed, but what was intended
to be a humiliation was converted into a triumph. The reliques were conveyed to their
resting place within the city as in a kind of festive procession, accompanied by crowds along
the whole way, four or five miles, chanting the words of the Psalm, “Confounded be all they
that worship carved images and delight in vain gods.” In vain were some of the Christians
seized and tortured. The popularity of the saint grew in proportion as Julian tried to put it

<pb n="185"/>
down; and the insults done to him were speedily avenged. A fire, mysterious in its origin,
broke out soon after the removal of the martyr’s reliques in the shrine of Apollo, consuming
the roof of the building, and the statue of the god. At the time when Chrysostom preached,
about twenty years later, the columns and walls were still standing, the melancholy wreck
serving as a memorial and witness of the judgment which had fallen upon the place.</p>
<p>The remains of Babylas were not brought back to Daphne, but removed from the city
to a magnificent church built to receive them on the other side of Orontes. Near the close
of his discourse Chrysostom refers to the erection of this church and to the zeal of the
Bishop Meletius in promoting it, who actually took part in the work with his own hands,
as we are told that Hugh did in the building of the Minster at Lincoln. But although the
body of the martyr rested elsewhere, his spirit and influence were supposed to inhabit in a
special manner the spot where he had put the heathen deity to silence and shame, and to
confer blessings on the pilgrims who resorted in crowds to his martyr in Daphne. The ruined
and deserted temple indeed, and the well preserved Christian church thronged with worshippers,
standing as they did side by side, formed a striking emblem of the two religions
to which they were devoted—the one destined to crumble and vanish away, the other to
endure and conquer.</p>

<head>HOMILIES ON S. IGNATIUS AND S. BABYLAS.</head>

<p>eulogy.</p>
<p>On the holy martyr Saint Ignatius, the god-bearer,366 arch-bishop of Antioch the great, who
was carried off to Rome, and there suffered martyrdom, and thence was conveyed back
again to Antioch.</p>
<p>1. Sumptuous and splendid entertainers give frequent and constant entertainments,
alike to display their own wealth, and to show good-will to their acquaintance. So also the
grace of the Spirit, affording us a proof of his own power, and displaying much good-will
towards the friends of God, sets before us successively and constantly the tables of the
martyrs. Lately, for instance, a maiden quite young, and unmarried, the blessed martyr
Pelagia, entertained us, with much joy. To-day again, this blessed and noble martyr Ignatius
has succeeded to her feast. The persons are different: The table is one. The wrestlings are
varied: The crown is one. The contests are manifold: The prize is the same. For in the case
of the heathen contests, since the tasks are bodily, men alone are, with reason, admitted.
But here, since the contest is wholly concerning the soul, the lists are open to each sex, for
each kind the theatre is arranged. Neither do men alone disrobe, in order that the women
may not take refuge in the weakness of their nature, and seem to have a plausible excuse,
nor have women only quitted themselves like men, lest the race of men be put to shame;
but on this side and on that many are proclaimed conquerors, and are crowned, in order
that thou mayest learn by means of the exploits themselves that in Christ Jesus neither male
nor female,367 neither sex, nor weakness of body, nor age, nor any such thing could be a
hindrance to those who run in the course of religion; if there be a noble readiness, and an
eager mind, and a fear of God, fervent and kindling, be established in our souls. On this
account both maidens and women, and men, both young and old, and slaves, and freemen,
and every rank, and every age, and each sex, disrobe for those contests, and in no respect
suffer harm, since they have brought a noble purpose to these wrestlings. The season then
already calls us to discourse of the mighty works of this saint. But our reckoning is disturbed
and confused, not knowing what to say first, what second, what third, so great a multitude
<note type="footnote">366 “Theophoros.” This was probably only a second name assumed by Ignatius, perhaps at the time of his
conversion or baptism. Legendary interpretations of it afterwards arose, which varied according as it was understood
in an active or passive sense, the “god-bearer” or the “god-borne.” See Bishop Lightfoot’s Apostolic
Fathers, vol. i., part ii., p. 25–28.</note>
<note type="footnote">367 Gal. iii. 28.</note>

<pb n="187"/>
of things calling for eulogy surrounds us, on every side; and we experience the same thing
as if any one went into a meadow, and seeing many a rosebush and many a violet, and an
abundance of lilies, and other spring flowers manifold and varied, should be in doubt what
he should look at first, what second, since each of those he saw invites him to bestow his
glances on itself. For we too, coming to this spiritual meadow of the mighty works of Ignatius,
and beholding not the flowers of spring, but the manifold and varied fruit of the spirit in
the soul of this man, are confused and in perplexity, not knowing to which we are first to
give our consideration, as each of the things we see draws us away from its neighbours, and
entices the eye of the soul to the sight of its own beauty. For see, he presided over the Church
among us nobly, and with such carefulness as Christ desires. For that which Christ declared
to be the highest standard and rule of the Episcopal office, did this man display by his deeds.
For having heard Christ saying, the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep,368
with all courage he did lay it down for the sheep.</p>
<p>He held true converse with the apostles and drank of spiritual fountains. What kind of
person then is it likely that he was who had been reared, and who had everywhere held
converse with them, and had shared with them truths both lawful and unlawful to utter,
and who seemed to them worthy of so great a dignity? The time again came on, which demanded
courage; and a soul which despised all things present, glowed with Divine love, and
valued things unseen before the things which are seen; and he lay aside the flesh with as
much ease as one would put off a garment. What then shall we speak of first? The teaching
of the apostles which he gave proof of throughout, or his indifference to this present life, or
the strictness of his virtue, with which he administered his rule over the Church; which shall
we first call to mind? The martyr or the bishop or the apostle. For the grace of the spirit
having woven a threefold crown, thus bound it on his holy head, yea rather a manifold
crown. For if any one will consider them carefully, he will find each of the crowns, blossoming
with other crowns for us.</p>
<p>2. And if you will, let us come first to the praise of his episcopate. Does this seem to be
one crown alone? come, then, let us unfold it in speech, and you will see both two, and three,
and more produced from it. For I do not wonder at the man alone that he seemed to be
worthy of so great an office, but that he obtained this office from those saints, and that the
hands of the blessed apostles touched his sacred head. For not even is this a slight thing to
be said in his praise, nor because he won greater grace from above, nor only because they
caused more abundant energy of the Spirit to come upon him, but because they bore witness
that every virtue possessed by man was in him. Now how this is, I tell you. Paul writing to
Titus once on a time—and when I say Paul, I do not speak of him alone, but also of Peter
and James and John, and the whole band of them; for as in one lyre, the strings are different
<note type="footnote">368 John x. 11.</note>

<pb n="188"/>
strings, but the harmony is one, so also in the band of the apostles the persons are different,
but the teaching is one, since the artificer is one, I mean the Holy Spirit, who moves their
souls, and Paul showing this said, “Whether therefore they, or I, so we preach.”369 This man,
then, writing to Titus, and showing what kind of man the bishop ought to be, says, “For the
bishop must be blameless as God’s steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no
striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober-minded,
just, holy, temperate, holding to the faithful word, which is according to the teaching, that
he may be able both to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers;”370 and
to Timothy again, when writing upon this subject, he says somewhat like this: “If a man
seeketh the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work. The bishop, therefore, must be
without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, orderly, given to
hospitality, apt to teach, no brawler, no striker, but gentle, not contentious, no lover of
money. Dost thou see what strictness of virtue he demands from the bishop? For as some
most excellent painter from life, having mixed many colors, if he be about to furnish an
original likeness of the royal form, works with all accuracy, so that all who are copying it,
and painting from it, may have a likeness accurately drawn, so accordingly the blessed Paul,
as though painting some royal likeness, and furnishing an original sketch of it, having mixed
the different colors of virtue, has painted in the features of the office of bishop complete, in
order that each of those who mount to that dignity, looking thereupon, may administer
their own affairs with just such strictness.</p>
<p>Boldly, therefore, would I say that Ignatius took an accurate impression of the whole of
this, in his own soul; and was blameless and without reproach, and neither self-willed, nor
soon angry, nor given to wine, nor a striker, but gentle, not contentious, no lover of money,
just, holy, temperate, holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, sober,
sober-minded, orderly, and all the rest which Paul demanded. “And what is the proof of
this?” says one. They who said these things ordained him, and they who suggest to others
with so great strictness to make proof of those who are about to mount to the throne of this
office, would not themselves have done this negligently. But had they not seen all this virtue
planted in the soul of this martyr would not have entrusted him with this office. For they
knew accurately how great danger besets those who bring about such ordinations, carelessly
and hap-hazard. And Paul again, when showing this very thing to the same Timothy wrote
and says, “Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins.”371 What

<pb n="189"/>
dost thou say? Has another sinned, and do I share his blame and his punishment? Yes, says
he, the man who authorizes evil; and just as in the case of any one entrusting into the hands
of a raging and insane person a sharply pointed sword, with which the madman commits
murder, that man who gave the sword incurs the blame; so any one who gives the authority
which arises from this office to a man living in evil, draws down on his own head all the fire
of that man’s sins and audacity. For he who provides the root, this man is the cause of all
that springs from it on every side. Dost thou see how in the meanwhile a double crown of
the episcopate has appeared, and how the dignity of those who ordained him has made the
office more illustrious, bearing witness to every exhibition of virtue in him?</p>
<p>3. Do you wish that I should also reveal to you another crown springing from this very
matter? Let us consider the time at which he obtained this dignity. For it is not the same
thing to administer the Church now as then, just as it is not the same thing to travel along
a road well trodden, and prepared, after many wayfarers; and along one about to be cut for
the first time, and containing ruts, and stones, and full of wild beasts, and which has never
yet, received any traveller. For now, by the grace of God, there is no danger for bishops, but
deep peace on all sides, and we all enjoy a calm, since the Word of piety has been extended
to the ends of the world, and our rulers keep the faith with strictness. But then there was
nothing of this, but wherever any one might look, precipices and pitfalls, and wars, and
fightings, and dangers; both rulers, and kings, and people and cities and nations, and men
at home and abroad, laid snares for the faithful. And this was not the only serious thing,
but also the fact that many of the believers themselves, inasmuch as they tasted for the first
time strange doctrines, stood in need of great indulgence, and were still in a somewhat feeble
condition and were often upset. And this was a thing which used to grieve the teachers, no
less than the fightings without, nay rather much more. For the fightings without, and the
plottings, afforded much pleasure to them on account of the hope of the rewards awaiting
them. On this account the apostles returned from the presence of the Sanhedrin rejoicing
because they had been beaten;372 and Paul cries out, saying: “I rejoice in my sufferings,”373
and he glories in his afflictions everywhere. But the wounds of those at home, and the falls
of the brethren, do not suffer them to breathe again, but always, like some most heavy yoke,
continually oppress and afflict the neck of their soul. Hear at least how Paul, thus rejoicing
in sufferings, is bitterly pained about these. “For who, saith he, is weak, and I am not weak?
who is offended, and I burn not?”374 and again, “I fear lest when I come I shall find you not
such as I would, and I be found of you such as ye would not,”375 and a little afterwards,

<pb n="190"/>
“Lest when I come again to you, God humble me, and I shall mourn many of those who
have sinned before, and have not repented of their uncleanness, and wantonness, and fornication
which they have committed.”376 And throughout thou seest that he is in tears and
lamentations on account of members of the household, and evermore fearing and trembling
for the believers. Just as then we admire the pilot, not when he is able to bring those who
are on board safe to shore when the sea is calm, and the ship is borne along by favourable
winds, but when the deep is raging and the waves contending, and the passengers themselves
within in revolt, and a great storm within and without besets those who are on board, and
he is able to steer the ship with all security; so we ought to wonder at, and admire those who
then had the Church committed to their hands, much more than those who now have the
management of it; when there was a great war without and within, when the plant of the
faith was more tender, and needed much care, when, as a newly-born babe, the multitude
in the church required much forethought, and the greatest wisdom in any soul destined to
nurse it; and in order that ye may more clearly learn, how great crowns they were worthy
of, who then had the Church entrusted to them, and how great work and danger there was
in undertaking the matter on the threshold and at the beginning, and in being the first to
enter upon it, I bring forward for you the testimony of Christ, who pronounces a verdict
on these things, and confirms the opinion which has been expressed by me. For when he
saw many coming to him, and was wishing to show the apostles that the prophets toiled
more than they, he says: “Others have laboured, and ye have entered into their labour.”377
And yet the apostles toiled much more than the prophets. But since they first sowed the
word of piety, and won over the untaught souls of men to the truth, the greater part of the
work is credited to them. For it is by no means the same thing for one to come and teach
after many teachers, and himself to be the first to sow seeds. For that which has been already
practised, and has become customary with many, would be easily accepted; but that which
is now for the first time heard, agitates the mind of the hearers, and gives the teacher a great
deal to do. This at least it was which disturbed the audience at Athens, and on this account
they turned away from Paul, reproaching him with, “Thou bringest certain strange things
to our ears.”378 For if the oversight of the Church now furnishes much weariness and work
to those who govern it, consider how double and treble and manifold was the work then,
when there were dangers and fighting and snares, and fear continually. It is not possible to
set forth in words the difficulty which those saints then encountered, but he alone will know
it who comes to it by experience.</p>

<p>4. And I will speak of a fourth crown, arising for us out of this episcopate. What then
is this? The fact that he was entrusted with our own native city. For it is a laborious thing
indeed to have the oversight of a hundred men, and of fifty alone. But to have on one’s hands
so great a city, and a population extending to two hundred thousand, of how great virtue
and wisdom dost thou think there is a proof? For as in the care of armies, the wiser of the
generals have on their hands the more leading and more numerous regiments, so, accordingly,
in the care of cities. The more able of the rulers are entrusted with the larger and more
populous. And at any rate this city was of much account to God, as indeed He manifested
by the very deeds which He did. At all events the master of the whole world, Peter, to whose
hands He committed the keys of heaven, whom He commanded to do and to bear all, He
bade tarry here for a long period. Thus in His sight our city was equivalent to the whole
world. But since I have mentioned Peter, I have perceived a fifth crown woven from him,
and this is that this man succeeded to the office after him. For just as any one taking a great
stone from a foundation hastens by all means to introduce an equivalent to it, lest he should
shake the whole building, and make it more unsound, so, accordingly, when Peter was about
to depart from here, the grace of the Spirit introduced another teacher equivalent to Peter,
so that the building already completed should not be made more unsound by the insignificance
of the successor. We have reckoned up then five crowns, from the importance of the
office, from the dignity of those who ordained to it, from the difficulty of the time, from the
size of the city, from the virtue of him who transmitted the episcopate to him. Having woven
all these, it was lawful to speak of a sixth, and seventh, and more than these; but in order
that we may not, by spending the whole time on the consideration of the episcopate, miss
the details about the martyr, come from this point, let us pass to that conflict. At one time
a grievous warfare was rekindled against the Church, and as though a most grievous tyranny
overspread the earth, all were carried off from the midst of the market-place. Not indeed
charged with anything monstrous, but because being freed from error, they hastened to
piety; because they abstained from the service of demons, because they recognized the true
God, and worshipped his only begotten Son, and for things for which they ought to have
been crowned, and admired and honoured, for these they were punished and encountered
countless tortures, all who embraced the faith, and much more they who had the oversight
of the churches. For the devil, being crafty, and apt to contrive plots of this kind, expected
that if he took away the shepherds, he would easily be able to scatter the flocks. But He who
takes the wise in their craftiness, wishing to show him that men do not govern His church,
but that it is He himself who everywhere tends those who believe on Him, agreed that this
should be, that he might see, when they were taken away, that the cause of piety was not
defeated, nor the word of preaching quenched, but rather increased; that by these very works
he might learn both himself, and all those who minister to him, that our affairs are not of
men, but that the subject of our teaching has its root on high, from the heavens; and that it

<pb n="192"/>
is God who everywhere leads the Church, and that it is not possible for him who fights
against God, ever to win the day. But the Devil did not only work this evil, but another also
not less than this. For not only in the cities over which they presided, did he suffer the
Bishops to be slaughtered; but he took them into foreign territory and slew them; and he
did this, in anxiety at once to take them when destitute of friends, and hoping to render
them weaker with the toil of their journey, which accordingly he did with this saint. For he
called him away from our city to Rome, making the course twice as long, expecting to depress
his mind both by the length of the way and the number of the days, and not knowing that
having Jesus with him, as a fellow traveller, and fellow exile on so long a journey, he rather
became the stronger, and afforded more proof of the power that was with him, and to a
greater degree knit the Churches together. For the cities which were on the road running
together from all sides, encouraged the athlete, and sped him on his way with many supplies,
sharing in his conflict by their prayers, and intercessions. And they derived no little comfort
when they saw the martyr hastening to death with so much readiness, as is consistent in
one called to the realms which are in the heaven, and by means of the works themselves, by
the readiness and by the joyousness of that noble man, that it was not death to which he
was hastening, but a kind of long journey and migration from this world, and ascension to
heaven; and he departed teaching these things in every city, both by his words, and by his
deeds, and as happened in the case of the Jews, when they bound Paul, and sent him to
Rome, and thought that they were sending him to death, they were sending a teacher to the
Jews who dwelt there. This indeed accordingly happened in the case of Ignatius in larger
measure. For not to those alone who dwell in Rome, but to all the cities lying in the intervening
space, he went forth as a wonderful teacher, persuading them to despise the present
life, and to think naught of the things which are seen, and to love those which are to come,
to look towards heaven, and to pay no regard to any of the terrors of this present life. For
on this and on more than this, by means of his works, he went on his way instructing them,
as a sun rising from the east, and hastening to the west. But rather more brilliant than this,
for this is wont to run on high, bringing material light, but Ignatius shone below, imparting
to men’s souls the intellectual light of doctrine. And that light on departing into the regions
of the west, is hidden and straightway causes the night to come on. But this on departing
to the regions of the west, shone there more brilliantly, conferring the greatest benefits to
all along the road. And when he arrived at the city, even that he instructed in Christian
wisdom. For on this account God permitted him there to end his life, so that this man’s
death might be instructive to all who dwell in Rome. For we by the grace of God need
henceforward no evidence, being rooted in the faith. But they who dwelt in Rome, inasmuch
as there was great impiety there, required more help. On this account both Peter and Paul,
and this man after them, were all slain there, partly, indeed, in order that they might purify
with their own blood, the city which had been defiled with blood of idols, and partly in order

<pb n="193"/>
that they might by their works afford a proof of the resurrection of the crucified Christ,
persuading those who dwell in Rome, that they would not with so much pleasure disdain
this present life, did they not firmly persuade themselves that they were about to ascend to
the crucified Jesus, and to see him in the heavens. For in reality it is the greatest proof of
the resurrection that the slain Christ should show forth so great power after death, as to
persuade living men to despise both country and home and friends, and acquaintance and
life itself, for the sake of confessing him, and to choose in place of present pleasures, both
stripes and dangers and death. For these are not the achievements of any dead man, nor of
one remaining in the tomb but of one risen and living. Since how couldest thou account,
when he was alive, for all the Apostles who companied with him becoming weaker through
fear to betray their teachers and to flee and depart; but when he died, for not only Peter and
Paul, but even Ignatius, who had not even seen him, nor enjoyed his companionship,
showing such earnestness as to lay down life itself for his sake?</p>
<p>5. In order then that all who dwell in Rome might learn that these things are a reality,
God allowed that there the saint should be perfected,379 and that this was the reason I will
guarantee from the very manner of his death. For not outside the walls, in a dungeon, nor
even in a court of justice, nor in some corner, did he receive the sentence which condemned
him, but in the midst of the theatre, while the whole city was seated above him, he underwent
this form of martyrdom, wild beasts being let loose upon him, in order that he might plant
his trophy against the Devil, beneath the eyes of all, and make all spectators emulous of his
own conflicts. Not dying thus nobly only, but dying even with pleasure. For not as though
about to be severed from life, but as called to a better and more spiritual life, so he beheld
the wild beasts gladly. Whence is this manifest? From the words which he uttered when
about to die, for when he heard that this manner of punishment awaited him, “may I have
joy,” said he, “of these wild beasts.”380 For such are the loving. For they receive with pleasure
whatever they may suffer for the sake of those who are beloved, and they seem to have their
desire satisfied when what happens to them is more than usually grievous. Which happened,
therefore, in this man’s case. For not by his death alone, but also by his readiness he studied
to emulate the apostles, and hearing that they, after they had been scourged retired with joy,
himself too wished to imitate his teachers, not only by his death, but by his joy. On this account
he said, “may I have joy of thy wild beasts,” and much milder than the tongue of the
tyrant did he consider the mouths of these; and very reasonably. For while that invited him
to Gehenna, their mouths escorted him to a kingdom. When, therefore, he made an end of
life there, yea rather, when he ascended to heaven, he departed henceforward crowned. For
this also happened through the dispensation of God, that he restored him again to us, and
<note type="footnote">379 Sc., suffer a martyr’s death.</note>
<note type="footnote">380 Quoted from Epistle of Ignatius to the Romans, c. v.</note>

<pb n="194"/>
distributed the martyr to the cities. For that city received his blood as it dropped, but ye
were honoured with his remains, ye enjoyed his episcopate, they enjoyed his martyrdom.
They saw him in conflict, and victorious, and crowned, but ye have him continually. For a
little time God removed him from you, and with greater glory granted him again to you.
And as those who borrow money, return with interest what they receive, so also God, using
this valued treasure of yours, for a little while, and having shown it to that city, with greater
brilliancy gave it back to you. Ye sent forth a Bishop, and received a martyr; ye sent him
forth with prayers, and ye received him with crowns; and not only ye, but all the cities which
intervene. For how do ye think that they behaved when they saw his remains being brought
back? What pleasure was produced! how they rejoiced! with what applause on all sides they
beset the crowned one! For as with a noble athlete, who has wrestled down all his antagonists,
and who comes forth with radiant glory from the arena, the spectators receive him, and do
not suffer him to tread the earth, bringing him home on their shoulders, and besetting him
with countless praises: so also the cities in order receiving this saint then from Rome, and
bearing him upon their shoulders as far as this city, escorted the crowned one with praises,
celebrating the champion, in song; laughing the Devil to scorn, because his artifice was
turned against him, and what he thought to do against the martyr, this turned out for his
behoof. Then, indeed, he profited, and encouraged all the cities; and from that time to this
day he enriches this city, and as some perpetual treasure, drawn upon every day, yet not
failing, makes all who partake of it more prosperous, so also this blessed Ignatius filleth
those who come to him with blessings, with boldness, nobleness of spirit, and much courage,
and so sendeth them home.</p>
<p>Not only to-day, therefore, but every day let us go forth to him, plucking spiritual fruits
from him. For it is, it is possible for him who comes hither with faith to gather the fruit of
many good things. For not the bodies only, but the very sepulchres of the saints have been
filled with spiritual grace. For if in the case of Elisha this happened, and a corpse when it
touched the sepulchre, burst the bands of death and returned to life again,381 much rather
now, when grace is more abundant, when the energy of the spirit is greater, is it possible
that one touching a sepulchre, with faith, should win great power; thence on this account
God allowed us the remains of the saints, wishing to lead by them us to the same emulation,
and to afford us a kind of haven, and a secure consolation for the evils which are ever overtaking
us. Wherefore I beseech you all, if any is in despondency, if in disease, if under insult,
if in any other circumstance of this life, if in the depth of sins, let him come hither with faith,
and he will lay aside all those things, and will return with much joy, having procured a
lighter conscience from the sight alone. But more, it is not only necessary that those who
are in affliction should come hither, but if any one be in cheerfulness, in glory, in power, in
<note type="footnote">381 2 Kings xiii. 21.</note>

<pb n="195"/>
much assurance towards God, let not this man despise the benefit. For coming hither and
beholding this saint, he will keep these noble possessions unmoved, persuading his own
soul to be moderate by the recollection of this man’s mighty deeds, and not suffering his
conscience by the mighty deeds to be lifted up to any self conceit. And it is no slight thing
for those in prosperity not to be puffed up at their good fortune, but to know how to bear
their prosperity with moderation, so that the treasure is serviceable to all, the resting place
is suitable, for the fallen, in order that they may escape from their temptations, for the fortunate,
that their success may remain secure, for those in weakness indeed, that they may
return to health, and for the healthy, that they may not fall into weakness. Considering all
which things, let us prefer this way of spending our time, to all delight, all pleasure, in order
that rejoicing at once, and profiting, we may be able to become partakers with these saints,
both of their dwelling and of their home, through the prayers of the saints themselves,
through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be glory to the
Father with the Holy Spirit, now and always forever and ever amen.</p>

<head>on the holy martyr, s. babylas.</head>
<p>1. I was anxious to-day to pay the debt which I promised you when I was lately here.
But what am I to do? In the meanwhile, the blessed Babylas has appeared, and has called
me to himself, uttering no voice, but attracting our attention by the brightness of his countenance.
Be ye not, therefore, displeased at the delay in my payment; at all events, the longer
the time is, the more the interest will increase. For we will deposit this money with interest.382
Since thus did the master command who entrusted it to us. Being confident, therefore, about
what is lent, that both the principal and the profit await you, let us not pass by the gain
which falls in our way to-day, but revel in the noble actions of the blessed Babylas.</p>
<p>How, indeed, he presided over the Church which is among us, and saved that sacred
ship, in storm, and in wave, and billow; and what a bold front he showed to the emperor,
and how he lay down his life for the sheep and underwent that blessed slaughter; these things
and such as these, we will leave to the elder among our teachers, and to our common father,
to speak of. For the more remote matters, the aged can relate to you but as many things as
happened lately, and within our lifetime, these, I a young man will relate to you, I mean
those after death, those after the burial of the martyr, those which happened while he remained
in the suburbs of the city. And I know indeed that the Greeks will laugh at my
promise, if I promise to speak of the noble deeds after death and burial of one who was
buried, and had crumbled to dust. We shall not assuredly on this account keep silence, but
on this very account shall especially speak, in order that by showing this marvel truly, we
may turn their laughter upon their own head. For of an ordinary man there would be no
noble deeds after death. But of a martyr, many and great deeds, not in order that he might
become more illustrious (for he has no need of glory from the multitude), but that thou,
the unbeliever mayest learn that the death of the martyrs is not death, but the beginning of
a better life, and the prelude of a more spiritual conversation, and a change from the worse
to the better. Do not then look at the fact, that the mere body of the martyr lies destitute of
energy of soul; but observe this, that a greater power takes its place by the side of it, different
from the soul itself—I mean the grace of the Holy Spirit, which pleads to all on behalf of the
resurrection, by means of the wonders which it works. For if God has granted greater power
to bodies dead and crumbled to dust, than to all living, much more will he grant to them a
better life than the former, and a longer, at the time of the bestowal of his crowns; what then
are this saint’s noble deeds? But be not disturbed, if we take our discourse a little further
back. For they who wish to display their portraits to advantage, do not uncover them until
they have placed the spectators a little way off from the picture, making the view clearer by
<note type="footnote">382 Luke xix. 23.</note>

<pb n="197"/>
the distance. Do you then also have patience with me while I direct my discourse into the
past.</p>
<p>For when Julian who surpassed all in impiety, ascended the imperial throne, and grasped
the despotic sceptre, straightway he lifted up his hands against the God who created him,
and ignored his benefactor, and looking from the earth beneath to the heavens, howled after
the manner of mad dogs, who alike bay at those who do not feed them and those who do
feed them. But he rather was mad with a more savage madness than theirs. For they indeed
turn from, and hate their friends and strangers alike. But this man used to fawn upon demons,
strangers to his salvation, and used to worship them with every mode of worship. But his
benefactor, and Saviour, and him who spared not the only Begotten, for his sake, he turned
from and used to hate, and made havoc of the cross, the very thing which uplifted the whole
world when it was lying prostrate, and drave away the darkness on all sides, and brought in
light more brilliant than the sunbeams; nor yet even then did he desist from his frenzy, but
promised that he would tear the nation of the Galilæans, out of the midst of the world; for
thus he was wont to call us; and yet if he thought the names of the Christians an abomination,
and Christianity itself to be full of much shame, for what reason did he not desire to put us
to shame by that means, but with a strange name? Yea because he knew clearly, that to be
called by what belongs to Christ, is a great ornament not only to men, but to angels, and to
the powers above. On this account he set everything in motion, so as to strip us of this ornament,
and put a stop to the preaching of it. But this was impossible, O wretched and
miserable man! as it was impossible to destroy the heaven and to quench the sun, and to
shake and cast down the foundations of the earth, and those things Christ foretold, thus
saying: “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.”383</p>
<p>Well, thou dost not submit to Christ’s words; accept therefore the utterance which thus
his deeds give. For I indeed having been privileged to know what the declaration of God is,
how strong, how invincible a thing, have believed that is more trustworthy than the order
of nature, and than experience in all matters. But do thou still creeping on the ground, and
agitated with the investigations of human reasoning, receive the witness of the deeds. I
gainsay nothing. I strive not.</p>
<p>2. What then do the deeds say? Christ said that it was easier for heaven and earth to be
destroyed, than for any of his words to fail.384 The emperor contradicted these words, and
threatened to destroy his decrees. Where then is the emperor who threatened these things?
He is perished and is corrupted, and is now in Hades, awaiting the inevitable punishment.
But where is Christ who uttered these decrees? In Heaven, on the right hand of the Father,
occupying the highest throne of glory; where are the blasphemous words of the Emperor,
<note type="footnote">383 Matt. xxiv. 35.</note>
<note type="footnote">384 Luke xvi. 17.</note>

<pb n="198"/>
and his unchastened tongue? They are become ashes, and dust and the food of worms.
Where is the sentence of Christ? It shines forth by the very truth of the deed, receiving its
lustre from the issue of the events, as from a golden column. And yet the emperor left
nothing undone, when about to raise war against us, but used to call prophets together, and
summon sorcerers, and everything was full of demons and evil spirits.</p>
<p>What then was the return for this worship? The overturning of cities, the bitterest
famine of all famines. For ye know doubtless, and remember, how empty indeed the market
place was of wares, and the workshops full of confusion, when everyone strove to snatch
up what came first and to depart. And why do I speak of famine, when the very fountains
of waters were failing, fountains which by the abundance of their stream, used to eclipse the
rivers. But since I have mentioned the fountains, come, forthwith, let us go up to Daphne,
and conduct our discourse to the noble deeds of the martyr. Although you desire me still
to parade the indecencies of the Greeks, although I too desire this, let us abstain; for wherever
the commemoration of a martyr is, there certainly also is the shame of the Greeks. This
emperor then, going up to Daphne used to weary Apollo, praying, supplicating, entreating,
so that the events of the future might be foretold to him. What then did the prophet, the
great God of the Greeks? “The dead prevent me from uttering,” saith he, “but break open
the graves, dig up the bones, move the dead.” What could be more impious than these
commands? The Demon of grave-robbing, introduces strange laws and devises new methods
of expelling strangers. Who ever heard of the dead being driven forth? who ever saw lifeless
bodies ordered to be moved as he commanded, overturning from their foundations the
common laws of nature. For the laws of nature are common to all men, that he who departs
this life should be hidden in the earth, and delivered over for burial, and be covered up in
the bosom of the earth the mother of all; and these laws, neither Greek, barbarian, Scythian,
nor if there be any more savage than they, ever changed, but all reverence them, and keep
them, and thus they are sacred and venerated by all. But the Demon raises his mask, and
with bare head, resists the common laws of nature. For the dead, he says, are a pollution.
The dead are not a pollution, a most wicked demon, but a wicked intention is an abomination.
But if one must say something startling, the bodies of the living full of evil, are more polluting
than those of the dead. For the one minister to the behests of the mind, but the other lie
unmoved. Now that which is unmoved, and destitute of all perception would be free from
all accusation. Not that I even would say that the bodies of the living are by nature polluting;
but that everywhere a wicked and perverted intention is open to accusations from all.</p>
<p>The dead body then is not a pollution O Apollo, but to persecute a maiden who wishes
to be modest, and to outrage the dignity of a virgin, and to lament at the failure of the
shameless deed, this is worthy of accusation, and punishment. There were at all events,
many wonderful and great prophets among ourselves, who spake also many things concerning
the future, and they in no case used to bid those who asked them to dig up the bones of the

<pb n="199"/>
departed. Yea Ezekiel standing near the bones themselves was not only not hindered by
them, but added flesh, and nerves and skin to them, and brought them back to life again.385
But the great Moses did not stand near the bones of the dead, but bearing off the whole dead
body of Joseph, thus foretold things to come.386 And very reasonably, for their words were
the grace of the Holy Spirit. But the words of these, a deceit, and a lie which is no wise able
to be concealed. For that these things were an excuse, and pretence and that he feared the
blessed Babylas, is manifest from what the emperor did. For leaving all the other dead, he
only moved that martyr. And yet if he did these things, in disgust at him, and not in fear, it
were necessary that he should order the coffin to be broken, thrown into the sea, carried to
the desert, be made to disappear by some other method of destruction; for this is the part
of one who is disgusted. Thus God did when he spake to the Hebrews about the abominations
of the Gentiles. He bade their statues to be broken, not to bring their abominations from
the suburbs to the city.</p>
<p>3. The martyr then was moved, but the demon not even then enjoyed freedom from
fear, but straightway learned that it is possible to move the bones of a martyr, but not to
escape his hands. For as soon as the coffin was drawn into the city, a thunderbolt came from
above upon the head of his image, and burnt it all up. And yet, if not before, then at least
there was likelihood that the impious emperor would be angry, and that he would send forth
his anger against the testimony of the martyr. But not even then did he dare, so great fear
possessed him. But although he saw that the burning was intolerable, and knew the cause
accurately; he kept quiet. And this is not only wonderful that he did not destroy the testimony,
but that he not even dared to put the roof on to the temple again. For he knew, he knew,
that the stroke was divinely sent, and he feared lest by forming any further plan, he should
call down that fire upon his own head. On this account he endured to see the shrine of
Apollo brought to so great desolation; For there was no other cause, on account of which
he did not rectify that which had happened, but fear alone. For which reason he unwillingly
kept quiet, and knowing this left as much reproach to the demon, as distinction to the
martyr. For the walls are now standing, instead of trophies, uttering a voice clearer than a
trumpet. To those in Daphne, to those in the city, to those who arrive from far off, to those
who are with us, to those men which shall be hereafter, they declare everything by their appearance,
the wrestling, the struggle, the victory of the martyr. For it is likely that he who
dwells far off from the suburb, when he sees the chapel of the saint deprived of a shrine, and
the temple of Apollo deprived of its roof would ask the reason of each of these things; and
then after learning the whole history would depart hence. Such are the noble deeds of the
martyr after death, wherefore I count your city blessed, that ye have shown much zeal about
<note type="footnote">385 Ez. xxxvii.</note>
<note type="footnote">386 Ex. xiii. 19.</note>

<pb n="200"/>
this holy man. For then, when he returned from Daphne, all our city poured forth into the
road, and the market places were empty of men, and the houses were empty of women, and
the bedchambers were destitute of maidens. Thus also every age and each sex passed forth
from the city, as if to receive a father long absent who was returning from sojourn far away.
And you indeed gave him back to the band of fellow enthusiasts. But the grace of God did
not suffer him to remain there for good, but again removed him beyond the river,387 so that
many parts of the country were filled with the sweet savor of the martyr. Neither even when
he came hither was he destined to be alone, but he quickly received, a neighbor, and a fellowlodger,
and one of similar life.388 For he shared with him the same dignity, and for the sake
of religion shewed forth equal boldness. Wherefore he obtained the same abode as he, this
wonderful man being no vain imitator, as it seems, of the martyr. For for so long a time he
laboured there, sending letters continually to the emperor, wearying the authorities, and
bringing the ministry of the body to bear upon the martyr. For ye know, doubtless, and remember
that when the midday summer sun possessed the heaven, he together with his acquaintances,
used to walk thither everyday, not as spectator only, but also, as intending to
be a sharer in what was going on. For he often handled stone, and dragged a rope, and
listened, in advance of the workmen themselves, to one who wanted to erect any building.
For he knew, he knew what rewards lie in store for him for these things. And on this account
he continued doing service to the martyrs, not only by splendid buildings nor even by continual
feasts, but by a better method than these. And what is this? He imitates their life,
emulates their courage, throughout according to his ability he keeps the image of the martyrs
alive, in himself. For see, they gave their bodies to the slaughter, he has mortified the
members of his flesh which are upon the earth. They stopped the flame of fire, he quenched
the flame of lust. They fought against the teeth of beasts, but this man bore off the most
dangerous of our passions, anger. For all these things let us give thanks to God, because he
hath thus granted us noble martyrs, and pastors worthy of martyrs, for the perfecting of the
saints, for the edifying of the body of Christ389 with whom be glory, honor, and might to
the Father, with the Holy and lifegiving Spirit, now and always, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>HOMILY CONCERNING LOWLINESS OF MIND;

<head>CONCERNING LOWLINESS OF MIND.</head>
<head>HOMILY.</head>
<p>Against those who improperly use the apostolic declaration which says, “Whether in pretence,
or in sincerity, Christ is preached:” (Phil. i. 18), and about humbleness of mind.</p>
</div>

<div type="commentary" subtype="introduction">
<head>Introduction.</head>
<p>There is an allusion at the beginning of this Homily to some remarks recently made on
the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican. These occur in Chrysostom’s fifth
Homily against the Anomoeans, one of a set of Homilies which, from internal
evidence, may be assigned to the close of the year 386, or beginning of 387. The
following homily therefore was delivered at Antioch, probably just before Christmas
386. There were some persons who explained the words of St. Paul cited in the title
as signifying that provided Christ was preached it mattered not whether the actual
doctrines taught were true or heretical. The main object of the homily is to vindicate
the language of the Apostle from this erroneous and mischievous interpretation.</p>

<pb n="203"/>
<p>1. When lately we made mention of the Pharisee and the publican, and hypothetically
yoked two chariots out of virtue and vice;390 we pointed out each truth, how great is the
gain of humbleness of mind, and how great the damage of pride. For this, even when conjoined
with righteousness and fastings and tithes, fell behind; while that, even when yoked
with sin, out-stripped the Pharisee’s pair, even although the charioteer it had was a poor
one. For what was worse than the publican? But all the same since he made his soul contrite,
and called himself a sinner; which indeed he was; he surpassed the Pharisee, who had both
fastings to tell of and tithes; and was removed from any vice. On account of what, and
through what? Because even if he was removed from greed of gain and robbery, he had
rooted over his soul391 the mother of all evils—vain-glory and pride. On this account Paul
also exhorts and says “Let each one prove his own work; and then he will have his ground
of boasting for himself, and not for the other.” Whereas he publicly came forward392 as an
accuser of the whole world;393 and said that he himself was better than all living men. And
yet even if he had set himself before ten only, or if five, or if two, or if one, not even was this
endurable; but as it was, he not only set himself before the whole world, but also accused
all men. On this account he fell behind in the running. And just as a ship, after having run
through innumerable surges, and having escaped many storms, then in the very mouth of
the harbour having been dashed against some rock, loses the whole treasure which is stowed
away in her—so truly did this Pharisee, after having undergone the labours of the fasting,
and of all the rest of his virtue, since he did not master his tongue, in the very harbour underwent
shipwreck of his cargo.394 For the going home from prayer, whence he ought to
have derived gain, having rather been so greatly damaged, is nothing else than undergoing
shipwreck in harbour.</p>
<p>2. Knowing therefore these things, beloved even if we should have mounted to the very
pinnacle of virtue, let us consider ourselves last of all; having learned that pride is able to
cast down even from the heavens themselves him who takes not heed, and humbleness of
mind to bear up on high from the very abyss of sins him who knows how to be sober. For
this it was that placed the publican before the Pharisee; whereas that, pride I mean and an
overweening spirit, surpassed even an incorporeal power, that of the devil; while humbleness
of mind and the acknowledgment of his own sins committed brought the robber into

Paradise before the Apostles. Now if the confidence which they who confess their own sins
effect for themselves is so great, they who are conscious to themselves of many good qualities,
yet humble their own souls, how great crowns will they not win.395 For when sinfulness be
put together with humbleness of mind it runs with such ease as to pass and out-strip righteousness
combined with pride. If therefore thou have put it to with righteousness, whither
will it not reach? through how many heavens will it not pass? By the throne of God itself
surely it will stay its course;396 in the midst of the angels, with much confidence. On the
other hand if pride, having been yoked with righteousness, by the excess and weight of its
own wickedness had strength enough to drag down its confidence; if it be put together with
sinfulness, into how deep a hell will it not be able to precipitate him who has it? These things
I say, not in order that we should be careless of righteousness, but that we should avoid
pride; not that we should sin, but that we should be sober-minded. For humbleness of mind
is the foundation of the love of wisdom which pertains to us. Even if thou shouldest have
built a superstructure of things innumerable; even if almsgiving, even if prayers, even if
fastings, even if all virtue; unless this have first been laid as a foundation, all will be built
upon it397 to no purpose and in vain; and it will fall down easily, like that building which
had been placed on the sand.398 For there is no one, no one of our good deeds, which does
not need this; there is no one which separate from this will be able to stand. But even if thou
shouldest mention temperance, even if virginity, even if despising of money, even if anything
whatever, all are unclean and accursed and loathsome, humbleness of mind being absent.
Everywhere therefore let us take her with us,399 in words, in deeds, in thoughts, and with
this let us build these (graces).</p>
<p>3. But the things belonging to humbleness of mind have been sufficiently spoken of;
not for the value of the virtue;400 for no one will be able to celebrate it in accordance with
its value; but for the intelligence of your love. For well do I know that even from the few
things that have been said you will embrace it with much zeal. But since it is also necessary
to make clear and manifest the apostolic saying which has been to-day read; seeming as it
does to many to afford a pretext for indolence; so that some may not, providing for themselves
hence a certain frigid defence, neglect their own salvation—to this let us direct our discourse.
What then is this saying? “Whether in pretence,” it says, “or in sincerity,401 Christ is

preached.”402 This many wrest absolutely403 and just as happens, without reading what
precedes and what comes after it; but having cut it off from the sequence of the remaining
members, to the destruction of their own soul they put it forward to the more indolent. For
attempting to seduce them from the sound faith; then seeing them afraid and trembling; on
the ground of its not being without danger to do this,404 and desiring to relieve their fears,
they bring forward this apostolic declaration, saying, Paul conceded this, by saying,
“Whether in pretence or in sincerity, let Christ be proclaimed.” But these things are not
(true), they are not. For in the first place he did not say “let him be proclaimed,” but “he is
proclaimed,” and the difference between this and that is wide. For the saying “let him be
proclaimed” belongs to a lawgiver; but the saying “he is proclaimed” to one announcing the
event. For that Paul does not ordain a law that there should be heresies, but draws away all
who attended to him, hear what he says, “If any one preaches to you a gospel besides what
ye have received, let him be anathema, were it even I, were it even an angel from the heavens.”
405 Now he would not have anathematized both himself and an angel, if he had known
the act to be without danger. And again— “I am jealous of you with a jealousy of God,” he
says; “for I have betrothed you to one husband a chaste virgin: and fear lest at some time,
as the serpent beguiled Eve by his wiliness, so your thoughts should be corrupted from the
singleness that is towards Christ.”406 See, he both set down singleness, and granted no allowance.
For if there were allowance, there was no danger: and if there was no danger Paul
would not have feared: and Christ would not also have commanded that the tares should
be burned up, if it were a thing indifferent to attend to this one or that or another: or to all
indiscriminately.407</p>
<p>4. What ever then is what is meant? I wish to narrate to you the whole history from a
point a little earlier;408 for it is needful to know in what circumstances Paul was when he
was writing these things by letter. In what circumstances therefore was he? In prison and
chains and intolerable perils. Whence is this manifest? From the epistle itself. For earlier
than this he says, “Now I wish you to know, brethren, that the circumstances in which I am
have come rather to the furtherance409 of the Gospel; so that my bonds have become

Now Nero had then cast him into prison. For just as some robber having set foot in the
house, while all are sleeping, when stealing every thing,412 if he see any one having lit a
lamp, both extinguishes the light and slays him who holds the lamp, in order that he may
be allowed in security to steal and rob the property of others; so truly also the Cæsar Nero
then, just as any robber and burglar while all were sleeping a deep and unconscious slumber;
robbing the property of all, breaking into marriage chambers,413 subverting houses, displaying
every form of wickedness; when he saw Paul having lighted a lamp throughout the world;
(the word of his teaching;) and reproving his wickedness, exerted himself both to extinguish
what was preached, and to put the teachers out of the way; in order that he might be allowed
with authority to do anything he pleased; and after binding that holy man, cast him into
prison. It was at that time then that the blessed Paul wrote these things. Who would not
have been astounded? who would not have marvelled? or rather who could adequately have
been astounded at and admired that noble and heaven-reaching soul; in that, while bound
in Rome and imprisoned, at so great a distance as that, he wrote a letter to the Philippians?
For you know how great is the distance between Macedonia and Rome. But neither did the
length of the way, nor the amount of time (required), nor the press of business, nor the
peril and the dangers coming one upon another, nor anything else, drive out his love for
and remembrance of the disciples; but he retained them all in his mind; and not so strongly
were his hands bound with the chains as his soul was bound together and rivetted by his
longing for the disciples:414 which very thing itself indeed also declaring, in the preface of
the Epistle he said, “On account of my having you in my heart, both in my bonds, and in
the defence and confirmation of the Gospel.”415 And just as a King, having ascended upon
his throne at morning-tide and taken his seat in the royal courts, immediately receives from
all quarters innumerable letters; so truly he also, just as in royal courts, seated in the dungeon,
both received and sent his letters in far greater number; the nations from all quarters referring
to his wisdom everything about416 what had taken place among themselves; and he administered
more business than the reigning monarch in proportion to his having had a larger
dominion entrusted to him. For in truth God had brought and put into his hands not those

who inhabited the country of the Romans only, but also all the barbarians, both land and
sea. And by way of showing this he said to the Romans, “Now I would not that ye should
be ignorant, brethren, that ofttimes I have purposed to come to you, and have been hindered
until the present; in order that I might have some fruit also among you, as among the rest
of the Gentiles too. Both to Greeks and barbarians, both to wise and those without understanding
I am a debtor.”417 Every day therefore he was in anxious thought at one moment
for Corinthians, at another for Macedonians; how Philippians, how Cappadocians, how
Galatians, how Athenians, how they who inhabited Pontus, how all together were. But all
the same, having had the whole world put into his hands, he continually cared not for entire
nations only, but also for each single man; and now indeed he despatched a letter on behalf
of Onesimus, and now on behalf of him who among the Corinthians had committed fornication.
For neither used he to regard this—that it was the individual who had sinned and
needed advocacy; but that it was a human being; a human being, the living thing most precious
to God; and for whose sake the Father had not spared even the Only-begotten.</p>
<p>5. For do not tell me that this or that man is a runaway slave, or a robber or thief, or
laden with countless faults, or that he is a mendicant and abject, or of low value and worthy
of no account; but consider that for his sake the Christ died; and this sufficeth thee for a
ground for all solicitude. Consider what sort of person he must be, whom Christ valued at
so high a price as not to have spared even his own blood. For neither, if a king had chosen
to sacrifice himself on any one’s behalf, should we have sought out another demonstration
of his being some one great and of deep interest to the King—I fancy not—for his death
would suffice to show the love of him who had died towards him. But as it is not man, not
angel, not archangel; but the Lord of the heavens himself, the only-begotten Son of God
himself having clothed himself with flesh, freely gave himself on our behalf. Shall we not
do everything, and take every trouble, so that the men who have been thus valued may enjoy
every solicitude at our hands? And what kind of defence shall we have? what allowance?
This at least is the very thing by way of declaring which Paul also said, “Do not by thy meat
destroy him for whose sake Christ died.”418 For desiring to shame, and to bring to solicitude,
and to persuade to care for their neighbours, those who despise their brethren, and look
down upon them as being weak, instead of all419 else he set down the Master’s death.</p>
<p>Sitting then in the prison he wrote the letter to the Philippians from that so great distance.
For such as this is the love that is according to God:420 it is interrupted by no one of human

things, since it has its roots from above in the heavens421 and its recompense. And what
says he? “Now I desire that ye should know, brethren.”422 Seest thou solicitude for his
scholars? seest thou a teacher’s carefulness? Hear too of loving affection of scholars towards
their teacher, that thou mayest know that this was what made them strong and unconquerable—
the being bound together with one another. For if “Brother helped by brother is as a
strong city;”423 far more so many bound together by the bonds of love would have entirely
repulsed the plotting of the wicked demon. That indeed then Paul was bound up with the
disciples, requires not even any demonstration further nor argument for us, since in truth
even when in bonds he anxiously cared for them, and each day, he was also dying for them,
burning with his longing.</p>
<p>6. And that the disciples too were bound up with Paul with all perfectness;424 and that
not men only, but women also, hear what he says about Phoebe. “Now I commend425 to
you Phoebe the sister, being a deaconess of the Church which is in Cenchreæ; that ye may
receive her in the Lord worthily of the saints, and stand by her, in whatever matter she may
require you, since426 she has proved a helper427 of many; and of me myself.”428 But in this
instance he bore witness to her of her zeal so far as help went (only:)429 but Priscilla and
Aquilla went as far even as death for Paul’s sake; and about them he thus writes, saying,
“Aquila and Priscilla salute you, who for my life’s sake laid down their own neck;”430 for
death clearly. And about another again writing to these very persons he says, “Because he
went as far as death; having counselled ill for his life, in order that he might supply your
deficiency in your service towards me.”431 Seest thou how they loved their teacher? how
they regarded his rest432 before their own life? On this account no one surpassed them then.

Now this I say, not that we may hear only, but that we may also imitate; and not to the ruled
only, but also to those who rule is what we say addressed; in order that both scholars may
display much solicitude about their teachers, and the teachers may have the same loving
affection as Paul about those placed under them; not those present only, but also those who
are far off. For also Paul, dwelling in the whole world just as in one house, thus continually
took thought for the salvation of all; and having dismissed every thing of his own; bonds
and troubles and stripes and straits, watched over and inquired into each day, in what state
the affairs of the disciples were; and often for this very purpose alone sent, now Timothy,
and now Tychicus; and about him he says, “That he may know your circumstances, and
encourage your hearts:”433 and about Timothy; “I have sent him, being no longer able to
contain myself; lest in some way the tempter have tempted you.”434 And Titus again elsewhere,
and another to another place. For since he himself, by the compulsion of his bonds
being often detained in one place, was unable to meet those who were his vitals, he met
them through the disciples.</p>
<p>7. And then therefore being in bonds he writes to the Philippians, saying, “Now I desire
that ye should know, brethren,”435 calling the disciples brethren. For such a thing as this is
love; it casts out all inequality, and knows not superiority and dignity; but even if one be
higher than all, he descends to the lowlier position of all; just what Paul also used to do. But
let us hear what it is that he desires they should know. “That the things which happened
unto me,” he says, “have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel.”436 Tell me, how
and in what way? Hast thou then been released from thy bonds? hast thou then put off thy
chain? and dost thou with free permission preach in the city? hast thou then, having gone
into an assembly, drawn out many long discourses about the faith, and departed after
gaining many disciples? hast thou then raised the dead and been made an object of wonder?
hast thou then cleansed lepers, and all were astounded? hast thou driven away demons, and
been exalted? No one of these things, he says. How then did the furtherance of the gospel
take place? tell me. “So that my bonds,” he says, “have become openly known in the whole
Court, and to all the rest.”437 What sayest thou? this then, this was the furtherance, this the
advance, this the increase of the proclamation—that all knew that thou wast bound. Yes, he
says: Hear at least what comes next, that thou mayest learn that the bonds not only proved
no hindrance, but also a ground of greater freedom of speech. “So that several438 of the

<pb n="210"/>
brethren in the Lord, in reliance on my bonds, more abundantly dare fearlessly to speak the
word.”439 What sayest thou, O Paul? have thy bonds inspired not anxiety but confidence?
not fear but earnest longing? The things mentioned have no consistency.440 I too know it.
For neither did these things take place according to the consistency of human affairs, he
means,441 but what came about was above nature, and the successes were of divine grace.
On this account what used to cause anxiety to all others, that to him afforded confidence.
For also if any one having taken the leader of an army and confined him, have made this
publicly known, he throws the whole camp into flight; and if any one have carried a shepherd
away from the flock, the security with which he drives off the sheep is great. But not in Paul’s
case was it thus, but the contrary entirely. For the leader of the army was bound, and the
soldiers became more forward in the spirit; and the confidence with which they sprung
upon their adversaries was greater: the shepherd was in confinement, and the sheep were
not consumed, nor even scattered.</p>
<p>8. Who ever saw, who ever heard of, the scholars taking greater encouragement in the
dangers of their teachers? How was it that they feared not? how was it that they were not
terrified? how was it that they did not say to Paul, “Physician, heal thyself,”442 deliver thyself
from thy manifold perils, and then thou will be able to procure for us those countless good
things? How was it they did not say these things? How! It was because they had been schooled,
from the grace of the Spirit, that these things took place not out of weakness, but out of the
permission of the Christ; in order that the truth might shine abroad more largely; through
bonds and imprisonments and tribulations and straits increasing and rising, to a greater
volume. Thus is the power of Christ in weakness perfected.443 For indeed if his bonds had
crippled Paul444 and made him cowardly; either himself or those belonging to him; one
could not but feel difficulty; but if rather they prepared him into greater renown, one must
be astounded and marvel, how through a thing involving dishonour glory was procured for
the disciple—through a thing inspiring cowardice confidence and encouragement resulted
to them all. For who was not astounded at him then, seeing him encircled with a chain?

Then demons took to flight all the more, when they saw him spending his time in a prison.
For not so splendid does the diadem make a royal head, as the chain his hands; not owing
to their proper nature, but owing to the grace that darted brightness on them.445 On this
account it was that great encouragement resulted to the disciples. For also they saw his body
indeed bound, but his tongue not bound, his hands indeed tightly manacled,446 but his
voice unshackled, and transversing the whole world more swiftly than the solar ray. And
this became to them an encouragement; learning as they did from the facts that no one of
present things is to be dreaded. For when the soul has been genuinely imbued by divine
longing and love, it pays regard to no one of things present; but just as those who are mad
venture themselves against fire and sword and wild beasts and sea and all else, so these too,
maddened with a most noble and most spiritual frenzy, a frenzy arising from sanity,447 used
to laugh at all things that are seen. On this account, seeing their teachers bound, they the
more exulted, the more prided themselves; by facts giving to their adversaries a demonstration
that on all sides they were impregnable and indomitable.</p>
<p>9. Then therefore, when matters were in this state, some of the enemies of Paul, desiring
to fan up the war to greater vehemence, and to make the hatred of the tyrant, which was
felt towards him greater, pretended that they themselves also preached; (and they did preach
the right and sound faith,) for the sake of the doctrine advancing more rapidly: and this
they did, not with the desire to disseminate the faith; but in order that Nero, having learnt
that the preaching was increasing and the doctrine advancing, might the sooner have Paul
led away to execution.448 There were therefore two schools; that of Paul’s scholars and that
of Paul’s enemies; the one preaching out of sincerity, and the others out of love of contention
and the hatred they felt towards Paul. And by way of declaring this he said, “Some indeed
through envy and strife are preaching Christ,” (pointing out those his enemies) “but some
also through good pleasure;”449 saying this about his own scholars.450 Then next about
those; “Some indeed out of contentiousness,” (his enemies,) not purely, not soundly, but,

“thinking that they are thereby bringing pressure upon my bonds;451 but the others out of
love;” (this again about his own brethren;) “knowing that I am set452 for the defence of the
gospel.” For what? Nevertheless, in any way; whether in pretence or in sincerity, Christ is
being announced.”453 So that vainly and to no purpose is this saying taken in reference to
heresies. For those who then were preaching were not preaching corrupt doctrine; but sound
and right belief. For if they were preaching corrupt doctrine, and were teaching other things
contrary to Paul, what they desired was certain not to succeed to them. Now what did they
desire? That the faith having grown, and the disciples of Paul having become numerous, it
should rouse Nero to greater hostility. And if they were preaching different doctrines, they
would not have made the disciples of Paul numerous; and by not doing so,454 they would
not have exasperated the tyrant. He does not therefore say this—that they were bringing in
corrupt doctrines—but that the motive from which they were preaching, this was corrupt.
For it is one thing to state the pretext455 of their preaching itself was not sound. For the
preaching does not become sound when the doctrine is laden with deception; and the pretext
does not become sound when the preaching indeed is sound, but they who preach do not
preach for the sake of God, but either with a view of enmity, or with a view to the favour of

not from a right motive, nor through piety456 that they were preaching what they did preach.
For it was not they might increase the gospel that they were doing this; but that they might
wage war against him, and throw him into greater danger—on this account he accuses them.
And see how with exactitude he laid it.457 “Thinking,” he says, “that they were putting
pressure upon my bonds.”458 He did not say, putting, but “thinking they were putting upon,”

that is supposing, by way of pointing out that even if they so supposed, still he himself was
not in such a position; but that he even rejoiced on account of the advance of the preaching.
He added therefore saying, “But in this I both rejoice and will rejoice:”459 whereas if he held
their doctrines deception, and they were bringing in heresies, Paul could not possibly rejoice.
But since the doctrine was sound and of genuine parentage, on this account he says, “I rejoice
and will rejoice.” For what if they460 are destroying themselves by doing this out of contentiousness?
Still, even unwillingly, they are strengthening my cause. Seest thou how great is
Paul’s power? how he is caught by no one of the devil’s machinations? And not only is he
not caught; but also by these themselves he subdues him. For great indeed is both the devil’s
craftiness,461 and the wickedness of those who minister to him; for under pretence of being
of the same mind, they desired to extinguish the proclamation.462 But “he who seizes the
cunning in their craftiness”463 did not permit that this should take place then. By way of
declaring this very thing at least Paul said, “But the continuing in the flesh is the more necessary
for your sake; and this I confidently know, that I shall continue and remain in
company with you all.”464 For those men indeed set their mind on casting me out of the
present life, and are ready to endure anything for this object: but God does not permit it on
your account.</p>
<p>11. These things therefore, all of them, remember with exactness in order that you may
be able with all wisdom to correct those who use the Scriptures without reference to circumstances465
and at hap-hazard, and for the destruction of their neighbours. And we shall be
able both to remember what has been said, and to correct others, if we always betake ourselves
to prayers as a refuge, and beseech the God who gives the word of wisdom to grant both
intelligence in hearing, and a careful and unconquerable guardianship of this spiritual deposit
in our hands. For things which often we have not strength to perform successfully
from our own exertions, these we shall have power to accomplish easily through prayers
which are persevering. For always and without intermission it is a duty to pray, both for
him who is in affliction, and him who is in dangers, and him who is in prosperity—for him
who is in relief and much prosperity, that these may remain unmoved and without vicissitude,

and may never change; and for him who is in affliction and his many dangers, that he may
see some favourable change brought about to him, and be transported into a calm of consolation.
Art thou in a calm? Then beseech God that this calm may continue settled to thee.
Hast thou seen a storm risen up against thee? Beseech God earnestly466 to cause the billow
to pass, and to make a calm out of the storm. Hast thou been heard? Be heartily thankful
for this; because thou hast been heard. Hast thou not been heard? Persevere,467 in order
that thou mayest be heard. For even if God at any time delay the giving, it is not in hatred
and aversion;468 but from the desire by the deferring of the giving perpetually to retain thee
with himself; just in the way also that affectionate fathers do;469 for they also adroitly manage
the perpetual and assiduous attendance of children who are rather indolent by the delay of
the giving. There is to thee no need of mediators in audience with God; nor of that much
canvassing;470 nor of the fawning upon others; but even if thou be destitute, even if bereft
of advocacy, alone, by thyself, having called on God for help, thou wilt in any case succeed.471
He is not so wont to assent when entreated by others on our behalf, as by ourselves who are
in need; even if we be laden with ten thousand evil deeds. For if in the case of men, even if
we have come into countless collisions with them, when both at dawn and at mid-day and
in the evening we show ourselves to those who are aggrieved against us, by the unbroken
continuance and the persistent meeting and interview we easily demolish their enmity—far
more in the case of God would this be effected.</p>

when called on by ourselves than by others; and that he often delays the giving, not from
the wish that we should be utterly perplexed, nor to send us out472 with empty hands; but
in order that he may become the author of greater good things to us—these three points I
will endeavour to make evident by the parable which has to-day been read to you. The woman
of Chanaan had come to Christ praying on behalf of a daughter possessed by a demon, and
crying out with much earnestness473 (it says,474 “Have pity on me, Lord, my daughter is
badly possessed by a demon.”) See, the woman of a strange nation, and a barbarian, and
outside of the Jewish commonwealth. For indeed what else (was she) than a dog,475 and
unworthy of the receiving her request? For “it is not,” he says, “good to take the children’s
bread, and to give it to the dogs.” But, all the same, from her assiduity, she became worthy.
For not only did he admit her into the nobility of children, dog as she was; but also he sent
her off with that high encomium saying, “O woman great is thy faith; be it done to thee as
thou wilt.”476 Now when the Christ says, “great is thy faith,” seek thou no other demonstration
of the greatness of soul which was in the woman. Seest thou how, from her assiduity
the woman, being unworthy, became worthy? Desirest thou also to learn that we accomplish
(our wish) by calling on him by ourselves more than by others? She cried out, and the disciples
having come to him say, “Let her go away, for she is crying after us:”477 and to them
he says, “I am not sent, unless to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”478 But when she had
come to him by herself and continued crying, and saying, “Yes, Lord, for even the dogs eat
from the table of their masters,”479 then he granted the favour and says, “Be it done unto
thee as thou wilt.” Seest thou how, when they were entreating him, he repelled; but when
she who needed the gift herself cried out, he assented? For to them he says, “I am not sent,
unless to the lost sheep of the house of Israel;” but to her480 he said, “Great is thy faith; be

it done unto thee as thou wilt.” Again, at the beginning and in the prelude of her request he
answered nothing; but when both once and twice and thrice she had come to him, then he
granted the boon; by the issue making us believe that he had delayed the giving, not that he
might repel her481 but that he might display to us all the woman’s endurance. For if he had
delayed in order that he might repel her, he would have not granted it even at the end; but
since he was waiting to display to all her spiritual wisdom, on this account he was silent.482
For if he had granted it immediately and at the beginning, we should not have known the
woman’s virtue.483 “Let her go”484 it says, “because she is clamouring behind us.” But what
(says) the Christ? “Ye hear a voice, but I see the mind: I know what she is going to say. I
choose not to permit the treasure hidden in her mind to escape notice; but I am waiting and
keeping silence; in order that having discovered it I may lay it down in publicity, and make
it manifest to all.</p>
<p>13. Having therefore learned all these things, even if we be in sins, and unworthy of receiving,
let us not despair; knowing, that by assiduity of soul we shall be able to become
worthy of the request. Even if we be unaided by advocate and destitute, let us not faint;
knowing that it is a strong advocacy—the coming to God one’s self by one’s self with much
eagerness. Even if he delay and defer with respect to the giving, let us not be dispirited;
having learned that the putting it off and delay is a sure proof of caring and love for mankind.
If we have thus persuaded ourselves; and with a soul deeply pained and fervent, and thoroughly
roused purpose; and such as that with which the woman of Chanaan approached,
we too come to him, even if we be dogs; even if we have done anything whatever dreadful;
we shall both rebut485 our own crimes, and obtain so great liberty of speech486 as also to be
advocates for others; in the way in which also this woman of Chanaan not only herself enjoyed

the present life with ease,489 and depart thither490 with confidence, with much zeal and
eagerness let us perform this perpetually. For thus shall we be able both to attain the good
things which are laid up, and to enjoy those excellent hopes; which God grant that we may
all attain; by the grace and loving kindness and compassion of our Lord Jesus Christ—with

<p>To those about to be illuminated;492 and for what reason the laver is said to be of regeneration
and not of remission of sins; and that it is a dangerous thing not only to forswear
oneself, but also to take an oath, even though we swear truly.</p>
<p>1. How delightful and lovable is our band of young brethren! For brethren I call you,
even now before you have been brought forth, and before your birth I welcome this relationship
with you: For I know, I know clearly, to how great an honour you are about to be led,
and to how great a dignity; and those who are about to receive dignity, all are wont to honor,
even before the dignity is conferred, laying up for themselves beforehand by their attention
good will for the future. And this also I myself now do. For ye are not about to be led to an
empty dignity, but to an actual kingdom: and not simply to a kingdom, but to the kingdom
of the Heavens itself. Wherefore I beseech and entreat you that you remember me when
you come into that kingdom, and as Joseph said to the chief butler “Remember me when it
shall be well with thee,”493 this also I say now to you, do ye remember me when it is well
with you. I do not ask this in return for interpreting your dreams, as he; for I have not come
to interpret dreams for you, but to discourse of matters celestial, and to convey to you glad
tidings of such good things as “eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard and which have
entered not into the heart of man, such are the things which God hath prepared for them
that love him.”494 Now Joseph indeed said to that chief butler, “yet three days and Pharaoh
will restore thee to thy chief butlership.” But I do not say, yet three days and ye shall be set
to pour out the wine of a tyrant, but yet thirty days, and not Pharaoh but the king of Heaven
shall restore you to the country which is on high, Jerusalem, which is free—to the city which
is in the heavens; and he said indeed, “Thou shalt give the cup into the hands of Pharaoh.”
<note type="footnote">492 I.e., to be baptized. A common name for Baptism was “illumination,” partly with reference to the instructions
which preceded it, as Justin Martyr says; “The laver is called illumination because the minds of those who
learn these things are enlightened:” partly also (perhaps rather) because baptism was regarded as a translation
from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light, the recipient becoming a child of God, and as such
entitled to the grace of the illuminating Spirit. Catechumens were divided into four classes according to the
stages of their preparation. It is to those who were in the final stage, the competentes or elect as they were called,
that the following instructions are addressed.</note>
<note type="footnote">493 Gen. xl. 14.</note>
<note type="footnote">494 1 Cor. ii. 9, 10.</note>

<pb n="220"/>
But I say not that you shall give the cup into the hands of the king, but that the king shall
give the cup into your hand—that dread cup, full of much power, and more precious than
any created thing. The initiated know the virtue of this cup, and you yourselves shall know
it a little while hence. Remember me, therefore, when you come into that kingdom, when
you receive the royal robe, when you are girt with the purple dipped in the master’s blood,
when you will be crowned with the diadem, which has lustre leaping forth from it on all
sides, more brilliant than the rays of the sun. Such are the gifts of the Bridegroom, greater
indeed than your worth, but worthy of his lovingkindness.</p>
<p>Wherefore, I count you blessed already before those sacred nuptials, and I do not only
count you blessed, but I praise your prudence in that you have not come to your illumination
as the most slothful among men, at your last breath, but already, like prudent servants,
prepared with much goodwill to obey your master, have brought the neck of your soul with
much meekness and readiness beneath the bands of Christ, and have received His easy yoke,
and have taken His light burden. For if the grace bestowed be the same both for you and
for those who are initiated at their last hour, yet the matter of the intention is not the same,
nor yet the matter of the preparation for the rite. For they indeed receive it on their bed,
but you in the bosom of the Church, which is the common mother of us all; they indeed
with lamentation and weeping, but you rejoicing, and exceeding glad: they sighing, you
giving thanks; they indeed lethargic with much fever, you filled with much spiritual pleasure;
wherefore in your case all things are in harmony with the gift, but in theirs all are adverse
to it. For there is wailing and much lamentation on the part of the initiated, and children
stand around crying, wife tearing her cheeks, and dejected friends and tearful servants; the
whole aspect of the house resembles some wintry and gloomy day. And if thou shalt open
the heart of him who is lying there, thou wilt find it more downcast than are these. For as
winds meeting one another with many a contrary blast, break up the sea into many parts,
so too the thought of the terrors preying upon him assail the soul of the sick man, and distract
his mind with many anxieties. Whenever he sees his children, he thinks of their fatherless
condition; whenever he looks from them to his wife, he considers her widowhood; when he
sees the servants, he beholds the desolation of the whole house; when he comes back to
himself, he calls to mind his own present life, and being about to be torn from it, experiences
a great cloud of despondency. Of such a kind is the soul of him who is about to be initiated.
Then in the midst of its tumult and confusion, the Priest enters, more formidable than the
fever itself, and more distressing than death to the relatives of the sick man. For the entrance
of the Presbyter is thought to be a greater reason for despair than the voice of the physician
despairing of his life, and that which suggests eternal life seems to be a symbol of death. But
I have not yet put the finishing stroke to these ills. For in the midst of relatives raising a tumult
and making preparations, the soul has often taken its flight, leaving the body desolate; and
in many cases, while it was present it was useless, for when it neither recognizes those who

<pb n="221"/>
are present, nor hears their voice, nor is able to answer those words by which it will make
that blessed covenant with the common master of us all, but is as a useless log, or a stone,
and he who is about to be illuminated lies there differing nothing from a corpse, what is the
profit of initiation in a case of such insensibility?</p>
<p>2. For he who is about to approach these holy and dread mysteries must be awake and
alert, must be clean from all cares of this life, full of much self-restraint, much readiness; he
must banish from his mind every thought foreign to the mysteries, and on all sides cleanse
and prepare his home, as if about to receive the king himself. Such is the preparation of your
mind: such are your thoughts; such the purpose of your soul. Await therefore a return worthy
of this most excellent decision from God, who overpowers with His recompense those who
show forth obedience to Him. But since it is necessary for his fellow servants to contribute
of their own, then we will contribute of our own; yea rather not even are these things our
own, but these too are our Master’s. “For what hast thou,” saith He, “that thou didst not
receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?”495
I wished to say this first of all, why in the world our fathers, passing by the whole year, settled
that the children of the Church should be initiated at this season; and for what reason, after
the instruction from us, removing your shoes and raiment, unclad and unshod, with but
one garment on, they conduct you to hear the words of the exorcisers. For it is not
thoughtlessly and rashly that they have planned this dress and this season for us. But both
these things have a certain mystic and secret reason. And I wish to say this to you. But I see
that our discourse now constrains us to something more necessary to say what baptism is,
and for what reason it enters into our life, and what good things it conveys to us.</p>
<p>But, if you will, let us discourse about the name which this mystic cleansing bears: for
its name is not one, but very many and various. For this purification is called the laver of
regeneration. “He saved us,” he saith, “through the laver of regeneration, and renewing of
the Holy Ghost.”496 It is called also illumination, and this St. Paul again has called it, “For
call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated ye endured a great
conflict of sufferings;”497 and again, “For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated,
and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and then fell away, to renew them again unto repentance.”
498 It is called also, baptism: “For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put
on Christ.”499 It is called also burial: “For we were buried” saith he, “with him, through
baptism, into death.”500 It is called circumcision: “In whom ye were also circumcised, with

<pb n="222"/>
a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh.”501
It is called a cross: “Our old man was crucified with him that the body of sin might be done
away.”502 It is also possible to speak of other names besides these, but in order that we should
not spend our whole time over the names of this free gift, come, return to the first name,
and let us finish our discourse by declaring its meaning; but in the meantime, let us extend
our teaching a little further. There is that laver by means of the baths, common to all men,
which is wont to wipe off bodily uncleanness; and there is the Jewish laver, more honorable
than the other, but far inferior to that of grace; and it too wipes off bodily uncleanness but
not simply uncleanness of body, since it even reaches to the weak conscience. For there are
many matters, which by nature indeed are not unclean, but which become unclean from
the weakness of the conscience. And as in the case of little children, masks, and other bugbears
are not in themselves alarming, but seem to little children to be alarming, by reason of the
weakness of their nature, so it is in the case of those things of which I was speaking; just as
to touch dead bodies is not naturally unclean, but when this comes into contact with a weak
conscience, it makes him who touches them unclean. For that the thing in question is not
unclean naturally, Moses himself who ordained this law showed, when he bore off the entire
corpse of Joseph, and yet remained clean. On this account Paul also, discoursing to us about
this uncleanness which does not come naturally but by reason of the weakness of the conscience,
speaks somewhat in this way, “Nothing is common of itself save to him who accounteth
anything to be common.”503 Dost thou not see that uncleanness does not arise from
the nature of the thing, but from the weakness of the reasoning about it? And again: “All
things indeed are clean, howbeit it is evil to that man who eateth with offense.”504 Dost thou
see that it is not to eat, but to eat with offense, that is the cause of uncleanness?</p>
<p>3. Such is the defilement from which the laver of the Jews cleansed. But the laver of
grace, not such, but the real uncleanness which has introduced defilement into the soul as
well as into the body. For it does not make those who have touched dead bodies clean, but
those who have set their hand to dead works: and if any man be effeminate, or a fornicator,
or an idolator, or a doer of whatever ill you please, or if he be full of all the wickedness there
is among men: should he fall into this pool of waters, he comes up again from the divine
fountain purer than the sun’s rays. And in order that thou mayest not think that what is
said is mere vain boasting, hear Paul speaking of the power of the laver, “Be not deceived:
neither idolators, nor fornicators, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves
with men, nor covetous, not drunkards, not revilers, not extortioners shall inherit the

kingdom of God.”505 And what has this to do with what has been spoken? says one, “for
prove the question whether the power of the laver thoroughly cleanses all these things.”
Hear therefore what follows: “And such were some of you, but ye were washed, but ye were
sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the spirit of our
God.” We promise to show you that they who approach the laver become clean from all
fornication: but the word has shown more, that they have become not only clean, but both
holy and just, for it does not say only “ye were washed,” but also “ye were sanctified and
were justified.” What could be more strange than this, when without toil, and exertion, and
good works, righteousness is produced? For such is the lovingkindness of the Divine gift
that it makes men just without this exertion. For if a letter of the Emperor, a few words being
added, sets free those who are liable to countless accusations, and brings others to the highest
honors; much rather will the Holy Spirit of God, who is able to do all things, free us from
all evil and grant us much righteousness, and fill us with much assurance, and as a spark
falling into the wide sea would straightway be quenched, or would become invisible, being
overwhelmed by the multitude of the waters, so also all human wickedness, when it falls
into the pool of the divine fountain, is more swiftly and easily overwhelmed, and made invisible,
than that spark. And for what reason, says one, if the laver take away all our sins, is
it called, not a laver of remission of sins, nor a laver of cleansing, but a laver of regeneration?
Because it does not simply take away our sins, nor simply cleanse us from our faults, but so
as if we were born again. For it creates and fashions us anew not forming us again out of
earth, but creating us out of another element, namely, of the nature of water. For it does not
simply wipe the vessel clean, but entirely remoulds it again. For that which is wiped clean,
even if it be cleaned with care, has traces of its former condition, and bears the remains of
its defilement, but that which falls into the new mould, and is renewed by means of the
flames, laying aside all uncleanness, comes forth from the furnace, and sends forth the same
brilliancy with things newly formed. As therefore any one who takes and recasts a golden
statue which has been tarnished by time, smoke, dust, rust, restores it to us thoroughly
cleansed and glistening: so too this nature of ours, rusted with the rust of sin, and having
gathered much smoke from our faults, and having lost its beauty, which He had from the
beginning bestowed upon it from himself, God has taken and cast anew, and throwing it
into the waters as into a mould, and instead of fire sending forth the grace of the Spirit, then
brings us forth with much brightness, renewed, and made afresh, to rival the beams of the
sun, having crushed the old man, and having fashioned a new man, more brilliant than the
former.</p>
<p>4. And speaking darkly of this crushing, and this mystic cleansing, the prophet of old
said, “Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”506 For that the word is in refer-
<note type="footnote">505 1 Cor. vi. 9, 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">506 Ps. ii. 9.</note>

<pb n="224"/>
ence to the faithful, what goes before sufficiently shows us, “For thou art my Son,” he says,
“to-day have I begotten thee, ask of me and I will give the heathen for three inheritance, the
utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.”507 Dost thou see how he has made mention
of the church of the Gentiles, and has spoken of the kingdom of Christ extended on all sides?
Then he says again, “Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron;” not grievous, but strong:
“thou shalt break them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”508 Behold then, the laver is more
mystically brought forward. For he does not say earthen vessels: but vessels of the potter.
But, give heed: For earthen vessels when crushed would not admit of refashioning, on account
of the hardness which was gained by them from the fire. But the fact is that the vessels of
the potter are not earthen, but of clay; wherefore, also, when they have been distorted, they
can easily, by the skill of the artificer, be brought again to a second shape. When, therefore,
God speaks of an irremediable calamity, he does not say vessels of the potter, but an earthen
vessel; when, for instance, he wished to teach the prophet and the Jews that he delivered up
the city to an irremediable calamity, he bade him take an earthen wine-vessel, and crush it
before all the people, and say, “Thus shall this city be destroyed, be broken in pieces.”509
But when he wishes to hold out good hopes to them, he brings the prophet to a pottery, and
does not show him an earthen vessel, but shows him a vessel of clay, which was in the hands
of the potter, falling to the ground: and brings him to it saying, “If this potter has taken up
and remodelled his vessel which has fallen, shall I not much rather be able to restore you
when you have fallen?”510 It is possible therefore for God not only to restore those who are
made of clay, through the laver of regeneration, but to bring back again to their original
state, on their careful repentance, those who have received the power of the Spirit, and have
lapsed. But this is not the time for you to hear words about repentance, rather may the time
never come for you to fall into the need of these remedies, but may you always remain in
preservation of the beauty and the brightness which ye are now about to receive, unsullied.
In order, then, that ye may ever remain thus, come and let us discourse to you a little about
your manner of life. For in the wrestling schools falls of the athletes are devoid of danger.
For the wrestling is with friends, and they practice all their exercises on the persons of their
teachers. But when the time of the contest has come, when the lists are open, when the
spectators are seated above, when the president has arrived, it necessarily follows that the
combatants, if they become careless, fall and retire in great disgrace, or if they are in earnest,
win the crowns and the prizes. So then, in your case these thirty days are like some wrestling
school, both for exercise and practice: let us learn from thence already to get the better of

<pb n="225"/>
that evil demon. For it is to contend with him that we have to strip ourselves, with him after
baptism are we to box and fight. Let us learn from thence already his grip, on what side he
is aggressive, on what side he can easily threaten us, in order that, when the contest comes
on, we may not feel strange, nor become confused, as seeing new forms of wrestling; but
having already practiced them amongst ourselves, and having learnt all his methods, may
engage in these forms of wrestling against him with courage. In all ways, therefore, is he
accustomed to threaten us, but especially by means of the tongue, and the mouth. For there
is no organ so convenient for him for our deception and our destruction as an unchastened
tongue and an unchecked utterance. Hence come many slips on our part: hence many serious
accusations against us. And the ease of these falls through the tongue a certain one showed,
when he said, “Many fell by the sword, but not so many as by the tongue.”511 Now the
gravity of the fall the same person shows us again when he says: “To slip upon a pavement
is better than to slip with the tongue.”512 And what he speaks of is of this kind. Better it is,
says he, that the body should fall and be crushed, than that such a word should go forth as
destroys the soul; and he does not speak of falls merely; he also admonishes us that much
forethought should be exercised, so that we should not be tripped up, thus saying “Make a
door and bars for thy mouth,”513 not that we should prepare doors and bars, but that with
much security, we should shut the tongue off from outrageous words; and again in another
place, after showing that we need influence from above, both as accompanying and preceding
our own effort so as to keep this wild beast within: stretching forth his hands to God, the
prophet said, “Let the lifting up of my hands be an evening sacrifice, set a watch, O Lord,
before my mouth, keep the door of my lips;” and he who before admonished, himself too514
says again “Who shall set a watch before my mouth, and a seal of wisdom upon my lips?”515
Dost thou not see, each one fearing these falls and bewailing them, both giving advice, and
praying that the tongue may have the benefit of much watchfulness? and for what reason,
says one, if this organ brings us such ruin, did God originally place it within us? Because
indeed, it is of great use, and if we are careful, it is of use only, and brings no ruin. Hear, for
example, what he says who spoke the former words, “Death and life are in the power of the
tongue.”516 And Christ points to the same thing when he says, “By thy words thou shalt be
condemned, and by thy words thou shalt be justified.”517 For the tongue stands in the midst

<pb n="226"/>
ready for use on either hand. Thou art its master. Thus indeed a sword lies in the midst,
and if thou use it against thine enemies, this organ becomes a means of safety for thee. But
if thou thrust its stroke against thyself, not the nature of the iron, but thine own transgression
becomes the cause of thy slaughter. Let us then take this view of the tongue. It is a sword
lying in the midst; sharpen it for the purpose of accusing thine own sins. Thrust not the
stroke against thy brother. For this reason God surrounded it with a double fortification;
with the fence of the teeth and the barrier of the lips, that it may not rashly and without
circumspection utter words which are not convenient. Well, dost thou say it will not endure
this? Bridle it therefore within. Restrain it by means of the teeth, as though giving over its
body to these executioners and making them bite it. For it is better that when it sins now it
should be bitten by the teeth, than one day when it seeks a drop of water and is parched
with heat, to be unable to obtain this consolation. In many other ways indeed it is wont to
sin, by raillery and blasphemy, by uttering foul words, by slander, swearing, and perjury.</p>
<p>5. But in order that we may not by saying everything at once to-day, confuse your minds,
we put before you one custom, namely, about the avoidance of oaths, saying this much by
way of preface, and speaking plainly—that if you do not avoid oaths, I say not perjury merely,
but those too which happen in the cause of justice, we shall not further discourse upon any
other subject. For it is monstrous that teachers of letters should not give a second lesson to
their children until they see the former one fixed well in their memory, but that we, without
being able to express our first lessons clearly, should inculcate others before the first are
completed. For this is nothing else than to pour into a perforated jar. Give great care, then,
that ye silence not our mouth. For this error is grave, and it is exceedingly grave because it
does not seem to be grave, and on this account I fear it, because no one fears it. On this account
the disease is incurable, because it does not seem to be a disease; but just as simple
speech is not a crime, so neither does this seem to be a crime, but with much boldness this
transgression is committed: and if any one call it in question, straightway laughter follows,
and much ridicule, not of those who are called in question for their oaths, but of those who
wish to rectify the disease. On this account I largely extend my discourse about these matters.
For I wish to pull up a deep root, and to wipe out a long-standing evil: I speak not of perjury
alone, but even of oaths in good faith. But so and so, says one, a forbearing man, consecrated
to the priesthood, living in much self-control and piety, takes an oath. Do not speak to me
of this forbearing person, this self-controlled, pious man who is consecrated to the priesthood;
but if thou wilt, add that this man is Peter, or Paul, or even an angel descended out of
heaven. For not even in such a case do I regard the dignity of their persons. For the law
which I read upon oaths, is not that of the servant, but of the King: and when the edicts of
a king are read, let every claim of the servants be silent. But if thou art able to say that Christ
bade us use oaths, or that Christ did not punish the doing of this, show me, and I am persuaded.
But if he forbids it with so much care, and takes so much thought about the matter

<pb n="227"/>
as to class him who takes an oath with the evil one (for whatsoever is more than these,
namely, than yea and nay, saith he, is of the devil),518 why dost thou bring this person and
that person forward? For not because of the carelessness of thy fellow servants, but from
the injunctions of his own laws, will God record his vote against thee. I have commanded,
he says, thou oughtest to obey, not to shelter thyself behind such and such a person and
concern thyself with other persons’ evil. Since the great David sinned a grievous sin, is it
then safe for us to sin? Tell me: on this account then we ought to make sure of this point,
and only to emulate the good works of the saints; and if there is carelessness, and transgression
of the law anywhere, we ought to flee from it with great care. For our reckoning is not
with our fellow-servants, but with our Master, and to him we shall give account for all done
in our life. Let us prepare ourselves therefore for this tribunal. For even if he who transgresses
this law be beyond everything revered and great, he shall certainly pay the penalty attaching
to the transgression. For God is no respecter of persons. How then and in what way is it
possible to flee from this sin? For one ought to show not only that the crime is grievous, but
to give counsel how we may escape from it. Hast thou a wife, hast thou a servant, children,
friends, acquaintance, neighbors? To all these enjoin caution on these matters. Custom is
a grievous thing, terrible to supplant, and hard to guard against, and it often attacks us unwilling
and unknowing; therefore in so far as thou knowest the power of custom, to such
an extent study to be freed from any evil custom, and transfer thyself to any other most
useful one. For as that custom is often able to trip thee up, though thou art careful, and
guardest thyself, and takest thought, and consideration, so if thou transferrest thyself to the
good custom of abstaining from oaths, thou wilt not be able, either involuntarily or carelessly,
to fall into the fault of oaths. For custom is really great and has the power of nature. In order
then that we do not continually distress ourselves let us transfer ourselves to another custom,
and ask thou each one of thy kindred and acquaintance this favor, that he advise thee and
exhort thee to flee from oaths, and reprove thee, when detected in them. For the watch over
thee which takes place on their part, is to them too counsel and a suggestion to what is right.
For he who reproves another for oaths, will not himself easily fall into this pit. For much
swearing is no ordinary pit, not only when it is about little matters but about the greatest.
And we, whether buying vegetables, or quarrelling over two farthings, or in a rage with our
servants and threatening them, always call upon God as our witness. But a freeman, possessed
of some barren dignity, thou wouldest not dare to call upon as witness in the market to such
things; but even if thou attemptedst it, thou wilt pay the penalty of thine insolence. But the
King of Heaven, the Lord of Angels, when disputing both about purchases and money, and
what not, thou draggest in for a testimony. And how can these things be borne? whence
then should we escape from this evil custom? After setting those guards of which I spoke
<note type="footnote">518 Matt. v. 35.</note>

<pb n="228"/>
round us, let us fix on a specified time to ourselves for amendment, and adding thereto
condemnation if, when the time has passed, we have not amended this. How long time will
suffice for the purpose? I do not think that they who are very wary, and on the alert, and
watchful about their own salvation, should need more than ten days, so as to be altogether
free from the evil custom of oaths. But if after ten days we be detected swearing, let us add
a penalty due to ourselves, and let us fix upon the greatest punishment and condemnation
of the transgression; what then is this condemnation? This I do not fix upon, but will suffer
you yourselves to determine the sentence. So we arrange matters in our own case, not only
in respect of oaths but in respect of other defects, and fixing a time for ourselves, with most
grievous punishments, if at any time we have fallen into them, shall come clean to our
Master, and shall escape the fire of hell, and shall stand before the judgment seat of Christ
with boldness, to which may we all attain, by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus
Christ, with whom be glory to the Father together with the Holy Spirit for ever and ever:
Amen.</p>

plaiting of hair, and gold, and concerning those who have used omens, and amulets, and
incantations, all which are foreign to Christianity.</p>
<p>1. I have come to ask first of all for some fruit in return for the words lately said out of
brotherly love to you. For we do not speak in order that ye should hear simply, but in order
that ye should remember what has been said, and may afford us evidence of this, by your
works. Yea, rather, not us, but, God, who knows the secrets of the heart. On this account
indeed instruction is so called, in order that even when we are absent, our discourse may
instruct your hearts.519 And be not surprised if, after an interval of ten days only, we have
come asking for fruit from the seed sown. For in one day it is possible at once to let the seed
fall, and to accomplish the harvest. For strengthened not by our own power alone, but by
the influence which comes from God, we are summoned to the conflict. Let as many therefore
as have received what has been spoken, and have fulfilled it by their works, remain reaching
forth to the things which are before. But let as many as have not yet arrived at this good
achievement, arrive at it straightway, that they may dispel the condemnation which arises
out of their sloth by their diligence for the future. For it is possible, it is indeed possible for
him who has been very slothful, by using diligence for the future to recover the whole loss
of the time that is past. Wherefore, He says, “To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not
your hearts, as in the day of provocation.”520 And this, He says, exhorting and counselling
us; that we should never despair, but so long as we are here, should have good hopes, and
should lay hold on what is before us, and hasten towards the prize of our high calling of
God. This then let us do, and let us inquire into the names of this great gift. For as ignorance
of the greatness of this dignity makes those who are honored with it more slothful, so when
it is known it renders them thankful, and makes them more earnest; and anyhow it would
be disgraceful and ridiculous that they who enjoy such glory and honors from God, should
not even know what the names of it are intended to show forth. And why do I speak about
this gift, for if thou wilt consider the common name of our race, thou wilt receive the greatest
instruction and incentive to virtue. For this name “Man,” we do not define according as
they who are without define it, but as the Divine Scripture has bidden us. For a man is not
merely whosoever has hands and feet of a man, nor whosoever is rational only, but whosoever
practices piety and virtue with boldness. Hear, at least, what he says concerning Job. For in
<note type="footnote">519 Catechism, or oral instruction, “Catechesis,” in Greek is called by that name. Chrysostom says, a word
derived from ἠχἠ, a sound, in order that it may “resound” in your minds ἐνηχῆ. It is impossible to preserve the
play upon words in the translation consistently with an exact rendering.</note>
<note type="footnote">520 Ps. xcv. 8.</note>

<pb n="230"/>
saying that “there was a man in the land of Ausis,”521 he does not describe him in those
terms in which they who are without describe him, nor does he say this because he had two
feet and broad nails, but he added the evidences of his piety and said, “just, true, fearing
God, eschewing every evil deed,”522 showing that this is a man; even as therefore another
says, “Fear God, and keep his commandments, because this is the whole man.”523 But if the
name man affords such a great incentive to virtue, much rather the term faithful. For thou
art called faithful on this account, because thou hast faith in God, and thyself art entrusted
from Him with righteousness, sanctification, cleansing of soul, adoption, the kingdom of
heaven. He entrusted thee with these, and handed them over to thee. Thou in turn hast entrusted,
and handed over other things to him, almsgiving, prayers, self-control and every
other virtue. And why do I say almsgiving? If thou givest him even a cup of cold water, thou
shalt not indeed lose this, but even this he keeps with care against that day, and will restore
it with overflowing abundance. For this truly is wonderful, that he does not keep only that
which has been entrusted to him, but in recompensing it increases it.</p>
<p>This too he has bidden thee do according to thy power, with what has been entrusted
to thee, to extend the holiness which thou hast received, and to make the righteousness
which comes from the laver brighter, and the gift of grace more radiant; even as therefore
Paul did, increasing all the good things which he received by his subsequent labors, and his
zeal, and his diligence. And look at the carefulness of God; neither did he give the whole to
thee then, nor withhold the whole, but gave part, and promised part. And for what reason
did he not give the whole then? In order that thou mightest show thy faith about Him, believing,
on his promise alone, in what was not yet given. And for what reason again did he
not there dispense the whole, but did give the grace of the Spirit, and righteousness and
sanctification? In order that he might lighten thy labors for thee, and by what has been
already given may also put thee in good hope for that which is to come. On this account,
too, thou art about to be called newly-enlightened, because thy light is ever new, if thou wilt,
and is never quenched. For this light of day, whether we will or no, the night succeeds, but
darkness knows not that light’s ray. “For the light shineth in the darkness, and the darkness
apprehended it not.”524 Not so bright at least is the world, when the sunbeams come forth,
as the soul shines and becomes brighter when it has received grace from the Spirit and learns
more exactly the nature of the case. For when night prevails, and there is darkness, often a
man has seen a coil of rope and has thought it was a serpent, and has fled from an approach-

ing friend as from an enemy, and being aware of some noise, has become very much alarmed;
but when the day has come, nothing of this sort could happen, but all appears just as it really
is; which thing also occurs in the case of our soul. For when grace has come, and driven
away the darkness of the understanding, we learn the exact nature of things, and what was
before dreadful to us becomes contemptible. For we no longer fear death, after learning
exactly, from this sacred initiation, that death is not death, but a sleep and a seasonable
slumber; nor poverty nor disease, nor any other such thing, knowing that we are on our
way to a better life, undefiled and incorruptible, and free from all such vicissitudes.</p>
<p>2. Let us not therefore remain craving after the things of this life, neither after the luxury
of the table, or costliness of raiment. For thou hast the most excellent of raiment, thou hast
a spiritual table thou hast the glory from on high, and Christ is become to thee all things,
thy table, thy raiment, thy home, thy head, thy stem. “For as many of you as were baptized
into Christ, did put on Christ.”525 See how he has become raiment for thee. Dost thou wish
to learn how he becomes a table for thee? “He who eateth me,” says He, “as I live because
of the Father, he also shall live because of me;”526 and that he becometh a home for thee,
“he that eateth my flesh abideth in me, and I in him;”527 and that He is stem He says again,
“I am the vine, ye the branches,”528 and that he is brother, and friend, and bride-groom, “I
no longer call you servants: for ye are my friends;”529 and Paul again, “I espoused you to
one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ;”530 and again, “That he
might be the first-born among many brethren;”531 and we become not his brethren only,
but also his children, “For behold,” he says, “I and the children which God has given me”532
and not this only, but His members, and His body. For as if what has been said were not
enough to show forth the love and the good will which He has shown forth towards us, He
has added another thing greater and nearer still, calling himself besides, our head. Knowing
all these matters, beloved, requite thy benefactor by the best conversation, and considering
the greatness of the sacrifice, adorn the members of thy body; consider what thou receivest
in thine hand, and never suffer it to strike any one, nor shame what has been honored with
so great a gift by the sin of a blow. Consider what thou receivest in thine hand, and keep it
clean from all covetousness and extortion; think that thou dost not receive this in thy hand,

but also puttest it to thy mouth, and guard thy tongue in purity from base and insolent
words, blasphemy, perjury, and all other such things. For it is disastrous that what is ministered
to by such most dread mysteries, and has been dyed red with such blood, and has
become a golden sword, should be perverted to purposes of raillery, and insult, and buffoonery.
Reverence the honor with which God has honoured it, and bring it not down to the
vileness of sin, but having reflected again that after the hand and the tongue, the heart receives
this dread mystery, do not ever weave a plot against thy neighbor, but keep thy thoughts
pure from all evil. Thus thou shalt be able to keep thine eyes too, and thy hearing safe. For
is it not monstrous, after this mystic voice is borne from heaven—I mean the voice of the
Cherubim—to defile thy hearing with lewd songs, and dissolute melodies? and does it not
deserve the utmost punishment if, with the same eyes with which thou lookest upon the
unspeakable and dread mysteries, thou lookest upon harlots, and dost commit adultery in
thy heart. Thou art called to a marriage, beloved: enter not in clad in sordid raiment, but
take a robe suitable to the marriage. For if when men are called to a material marriage,
though they be poorer than all others, they often possess themselves of or buy clean raiment,
and so go to meet those who called them. Do thou too who hast been called to a spiritual
marriage, and to a royal banquet, consider what kind of raiment it would be right for thee
to buy, but rather there is not even need to purchase, yea he himself who calls thee gives it
thee gratis, in order that thou mayest not be able to plead poverty in excuse. Keep, therefore,
the raiment which thou receivedst. For if thou losest it, thou wilt not be able to use it
henceforth, or to buy it. For this kind of raiment is nowhere sold. Hast thou heard how
those who were initiated, in old time, groaned, and beat their breasts, their conscience
thereupon exciting them? Beware then, beloved, that thou do not at any time suffer like this.
But how wilt thou not suffer, if thou dost not cast off the wicked habit of evil men? For this
reason I said before, and speak now and will not cease speaking, if any has not rectified the
defects in his morals, nor furnished himself with easily acquired virtue, let him not be baptized.
For the laver is able to remit former sins, but there is no little fear, and no ordinary
danger lest we return to them, and our remedy become a wound. For by how much greater
the grace is, by so much is the punishment more for those who sin after these things.</p>
<p>3. In order, therefore, that we return not to our former vomit, let us henceforward discipline
ourselves. For that we must repent beforehand, and desist from our former evil, and
so come forward for grace, hear what John says, and what the leader of the apostles says to
those who are about to be baptized. For the one says, “Bring forth fruit worthy of repentance,
and begin not to say within yourselves, we have Abraham to our Father;”533 and the other
says again to those who question him, “Repent ye and be baptized every one of you in the
name of the Lord Jesus Christ.”534 Now he who repents, no longer touches the same matters
<note type="footnote">533 Luke iii. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">534 Acts ii. 38.</note>

<pb n="233"/>
of which he repented. On this account, also, we are bidden to say, “I renounce thee, Satan,”
in order that we may never more return to him.535 As therefore happens in the case of
painters from life, so let it happen in your case. For they, arranging their boards, and tracing
white lines upon them, and sketching the royal likeness in outline, before they apply the
actual colors, rub out some lines, and change some for others, rectifying mistakes, and altering
what is amiss with all freedom. But when they put on the coloring for good, it is no longer
in their power to rub out again, and to change one thing for another, since they injure the
beauty of the portrait, and the result becomes an eyesore. Consider that thy soul is the portrait;
before therefore the true coloring of the spirit comes, wipe out habits which have
wrongly been implanted in thee, whether swearing, or falsehood, or insolence, or base
talking, or jesting, or whatever else thou hast a habit of doing of things unlawful. Away with
the habit, in order that thou mayest not return to it, after baptism. The laver causes the sins
to disappear. Correct thy habits, so that when the colors are applied, and the royal likeness
is brought out, thou mayest no more wipe them out in the future; and add damage and scars
to the beauty which has been given thee by God.536 Restrain therefore anger, extinguish
passion. Be not thou vexed, be sympathizing, be not exasperated, nor say, “I have been injured
in regard to my soul.” No one is injured in regard to the soul if we do not injure ourselves
in regard to the soul; and how this is, I now say. Has any one taken away thy substance? He
has not injured thee in regard to thy soul, but thy money. But if thou cherish ill-will against
him, thou hast injured thyself in regard to thy soul. For the money taken away has wrought
thee no damage, nay has even been profitable, but thou by not dismissing thine anger wilt
give account in the other world for this cherishing of ill-will. Has any one reviled thee and
insulted thee. He has in no way injured thy soul, and not even thy body. Hast thou reviled
in return and insulted? Thou hast injured thyself in regard to thy soul, for for the words
which thou hast said thou art about to render account there; and this I wish you to know
chiefly of all, that the Christian, and faithful man, no one is able to injure in regard to the
soul, not even the devil himself; and not only is this wonderful, that God hath made us inaccessible
to all his designs, but that he has constituted us fit for the practice of virtue, and
there is no hinderance, if we will, even though we be poor, weak in body, outcast, nameless,
bondservants. For neither poverty, nor infirmity, nor deformity of body, nor servitude, nor
<note type="footnote">535 Alluding to the vow of renunciation made by converts at baptism. A specimen of this vow may be read
in the so-called Apostolic Constitutions, vii. c. 42. “I renounce Satan and his works, and his pomps, and his
service, and his angels, and his inventions, and all things that belong or are subject to him.” This vow of renunciation
was uttered by the catechumens in the porch or ante-chamber of the baptistery with outstretched hands,
and faces turned westwards. See below in Chapter V.</note>
<note type="footnote">536 The illustration is that of a portrait-painter making a likeness of the emperor, and there seems to be an
allusion also to the divine image in which man was originally made.</note>

<pb n="234"/>
any other of such things could ever become a hinderance to virtue; and why do I say, poor,
and a bondservant, and nameless? Even if thou art a prisoner, not even this would be ever
any hinderance to thee as regards virtue. And how this is I proceed to say. Has any of thy
household grieved thee and provoked thee? dismiss thy wrath against him. Have bonds,
and poverty, and obscurity been any hinderance to thee in this respect? and why do I say
hinderance? They have both helped and contributed to restrain pride. Hast thou seen another
prospering? do not envy him. For not even in this case is poverty a bar. Again, whenever
thou needest to pray, do so with a sober and watchful mind, and nothing shall be a bar even
in that case. Show all meekness, forbearance, self-restraint, gravity. For these things need
no external helps. And this especially is the chief point about virtue, that it has no necessity
for wealth, power, glory, nor anything of that kind, but of a sanctified soul alone, and it
seeks for nothing more. And behold, also, the same thing happening in respect of grace. For
if any one be lame, if he has had his eyes put out, if he be maimed in body, if he has fallen
into the last extremity of weakness, grace is not hindered from coming by any of these things.
For it only seeks a soul receiving it with readiness, and all these external things it passes
over. For in the case of worldly soldiers, those who are about to enlist them for the army
seek for stature of body and healthy condition, and it is not only necessary that he who is
about to become a soldier should have these alone, but he must also be free. For if anybody
be a slave, he is rejected. But the King of Heaven seeks for nothing of this kind, but receives
slaves into his army, and aged people, and the languid in limb, and is not ashamed. What
is more merciful than this? What could be more kind? For he seeks for what is in our own
power, but they seek for what is not in our power. For to be a slave or free is not our doing.
To be tall, again, or short is not in our own power, or to be aged, or well grown, and such
like. But to be forbearing and kind, and so forth, are matters of our own choice; and God
demands of us only those things of which we have control. And quite reasonably. For He
does not call us to grace because of his own need, but because of doing us kindness; but
kings, because of services required by them; and they carry men off to an outward and material
warfare, but He to a spiritual combat; and it is not only in the case of heathen wars,
but in the case of the games also that one may see the same analogy. For they who are about
to be brought into the theatre, do not descend to the contest until the herald himself takes
them beneath the gaze of all, and leads them round, shouting out and saying, “Has any one
a charge against this person?” although in that case the struggle is not concerned with the
soul, but with the body. Wherefore then dost thou demand proofs of nobleness? But in this
case there is nothing of the kind, but all is different, our contest not consisting of hand
locked in hand, but in philosophy of soul, and excellence of mind. The president of our
conflicts does the opposite. For he does not take us, and lead us round and say, “Has any
one a charge against this man?” but cries out, “Though all men, though demons, stand up
with the devil and accuse him of extreme and unspeakable crimes, I reject him not, nor abhor

<pb n="235"/>
him, but removing him from his accusers, and freeing him from his wickedness, thus I bring
him to the contest. And this is very reasonable. For there indeed the president contributes
nothing towards the victory, in the case of the combatants, but stands still in the midst. But
here, the President of the contests for holiness becomes a fellow-combatant, and helper,
sharing with them the conflict against the devil.</p>
<p>4. And not only is this the wonderful thing that he remits our sins, but that he not even
reveals them nor makes them manifest and patent, nor compels us to come forward into
the midst, and to tell out our errors, but bids us make our defense to him alone, and to
confess ourselves to him. And yet among secular judges, if any tell any of the robbers or
grave-riflers, when they are arrested, to tell their errors and be quit of their punishment,
they would accede to this with all readiness, despising the shame through desire of safety.
But in this case there is nothing of this kind, but he both remits the sins, nor compels us to
marshal them in array before any spectators. But one thing alone he seeks, that he who enjoys
this remission should learn the greatness of the gift. How is it not, therefore, absurd that in
case where he does us service, he should be content with our testimony only, but in those
where we serve him we seek for others as witnesses, and do a thing for ostentation’s sake?
While we wonder then at his kindliness, let us show forth our doings, and before all others
let us curb the vehemence of our tongue, and not always be giving utterance. “For in the
multitude of words there wanteth not transgression.”537 If indeed then thou hast anything
useful to say, open thy lips. But if there be nothing necessary for thee to say, be silent, for it
is better. Art thou a handicraftsman? as thou sittest at work, sing psalms. Dost thou not
wish to sing with thy mouth? do this in thine heart; a psalm is a great companion. In this
case thou shalt undergo nothing serious, but shalt be able to sit in thy workshop as in a
monastery. For not suitableness of place, but strictness of morals will afford us quiet. Paul,
at least, pursuing his trade in a workshop suffered no injury to his own virtue.538 Do not
thou therefore say, How can I, being a handicraftsman and a poor man, be a philosopher?
This is indeed the very reason why thou mayest be a philosopher. For poverty is far more
conducive to piety for us than wealth, and work than idleness; since wealth is even a
hinderance to those who do not take heed. For when it is needful to dismiss anger, to extinguish
envy, to curb passion, to offer prayer, to exhibit forbearance and meekness, kindliness
and charity, when would poverty be a bar? For it is not possible by spending money to accomplish
these things, but by exhibiting a right disposition; almsgiving especially needs
money, but even it shines forth in greater degree through poverty. For she who spent the
two mites was poorer than all men, and yet surpassed all.539 Let us not then consider wealth
<note type="footnote">537 Prov. x. 19.</note>
<note type="footnote">538 Acts xviii. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">539 Luke xxi. 2–4.</note>

<pb n="236"/>
to be anything great, nor gold to be better than clay. For the value of material things is not
owing to their nature, but to our estimate of them. For if any one would inquire carefully,
iron is much more necessary than gold. For the one contributes to no need of our life, but
the other has furnished us with the greater part of our needs, ministering to countless arts;
and why do I speak of a comparison between gold and iron? For these stones540 are more
necessary than precious stones. For of those nothing serviceable could be made, but out of
these, houses and walls and cities are erected. But do thou show me what gain could be derived
from these pearls, rather what harm would not happen? For in order that thou mayest
wear one pearl drop, countless poor people are pinched with hunger. What excuse wilt thou
hit upon? what pardon?</p>
<p>Dost thou wish to adorn thy face? Do so not with pearls, but with modesty, and dignity.
So thy countenance will be more full of grace in the eyes of thy husband. For the other kind
of adorning is wont to plunge him into a suspicion of jealousy, and into enmity, quarrelsomeness
and strife, for nothing is more annoying than a face which is suspected. But the
ornament of compassion and modesty casts out all evil suspicion, and will draw thy partner
to thee more strongly than any bond. For natural beauty does not impart such comeliness
to the face as does the disposition of him who beholds it, and nothing is so wont to produce
that disposition as modesty and dignity; so that if any woman be comely, and her husband
be ill affected towards her, she appears to him the most worthless of all women; and if she
do not happen to be fair of face, but her husband be well affected towards her, she appears
more comely than all. For sentence is given not according to the nature of what is beheld,
but according to the disposition of the beholders. Adorn thy face then with modesty, dignity,
pity, lovingkindness, charity, affection for thy husband, forbearance, meekness, endurance
of ill. These are the tints of virtue. By means of these thou wilt attract angels not human
beings to be thy lovers. By means of these thou hast God to commend thee, and when God
receives thee, he will certainly win over thy husband for thee. For if the wisdom of a man
illuminates his countenance,541 much more does the virtue of a woman illuminate her face;
and if thou considerest this to be a great ornament, tell me what will be the advantage of
the pearls in that day? But why is it necessary to speak of that day, since it is possible to show
all this from what happens now. When, then, they who thought fit to revile the emperor
were dragged to the judgment hall, and were in danger of extreme measures being taken,
then the mothers, and the wives, laying aside their necklaces, and their golden ornaments,
and pearls, and all adornment, and golden raiment, wearing a simple and mean dress, and
besprinkled with ashes, prostrated themselves before the doors of the judgment hall and
thus won over the judges; and if in the case of these earthly courts of justice, the golden or-
<note type="footnote">540 Alluding probably to the stones of the building in which he was speaking.</note>
<note type="footnote">541 Eccles. viii. 1.</note>

<pb n="237"/>
naments, and the pearls, and the variegated dress would have been a snare and a betrayal,
but forbearance, and meekness, and ashes, and tears, and mean garments persuaded the
judge, much more would this take place in the case of that impartial and dread tribunal. For
what reason wilt thou be able to state, what defense, when the Master lays these pearls to
thy charge, and brings the poor who have perished with hunger into the midst? On this account
Paul said, “not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly raiment.”542 For therein
would be a snare. And if we were to enjoy them continually, yet we shall lay them aside with
death. But arising out of virtue there is all security, and no vicissitude and changeableness,
but here it makes us more secure, and also accompanies us there. Dost thou wish to possess
pearls, and never to lay aside this wealth? Take off all ornament and place it in the hands of
Christ through the poor. He will keep all thy wealth for thee, when He shall raise up thy
body with much radiancy. Then He shall invest thee with better wealth and greater ornament,
since this present is mean and absurd. Consider then whom thou wishest to please, and for
whose sake thou puttest on this ornament, not in order that the ropemaker and the coppersmith
and the huckster may admire. Then art thou not ashamed, nor blushest thou when
thou showest thyself to them? doing all on their account whom thou dost not consider
worthy of accosting.</p>
<p>How then wilt thou laugh this fancy to scorn? If thou wilt remember that word, which
thou sentest forth when thou wert initiated, I renounce thee, Satan, and thy pomp, and thy
service. For the frenzy about pearls is a pomp of Satan. For thou didst receive gold not in
order that thou mightest bind it on to thy body, but in order that thou mightest release and
nourish the poor. Say therefore constantly, I renounce thee, Satan. Nothing is more safe
than this word if we shall prove it by our deeds.</p>
<p>5. This I think it right that you who are about to be initiated should learn. For this word
is a covenant with the Master. And just as we, when we buy slaves, first ask those who are
being sold if they are willing to be our servants: So also does Christ. When He is about to
receive thee into service, He first asks if thou wishest to leave that cruel and relentless tyrant,
and He receives covenants from thee. For his service is not forced upon thee. And see the
lovingkindness of God. For we, before we put down the price, ask those who are being sold,
and when we have learned that they are willing, then we put down the price. But Christ not
so, but He even put down the price for us all; his precious blood. For, He says, ye were bought
with a price.543 Notwithstanding, not even then does He compel those who are unwilling,
to serve him; but except thou hast grace, He says, and of thine own accord and will determinest
to enroll thyself under my rule, I do not compel, nor force thee. And we should not
have chosen to buy wicked slaves. But if we should at any time have so chosen, we buy them
<note type="footnote">542 1 Tim. ii. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">543 1 Cor. vii. 25.</note>

<pb n="238"/>
with a perverted choice, and put down a corresponding price for them. But Christ, buying
ungrateful and lawless slaves, put down the price of a servant of first quality, nay rather
much more, and so much greater that neither speech nor thought can set forth its greatness.
For neither giving heaven, nor earth, nor sea, but giving up that which is more valuable than
all these, his own blood, thus He bought us. And after all these things, he does not require
of us witnesses, or registration, but is content with the single word, if thou sayest it from
thy heart. “I renounce thee, Satan, and thy pomp,” has included all. Let us then say this, “I
renounce thee, Satan,” as men who are about in that world at that day to have that word
demanded of them, and let us keep it in order that we may then return this deposit safe. But
Satan’s pomps are theatres, and the circus, and all sin, and observance of days, and incantations
and omens.</p>
<p>“And what are omens?” says one. Often when going forth from his own house he has
seen a one-eyed or lame man, and has shunned him as an omen. This is a pomp of Satan.
For meeting the man does not make the day turn out ill, but to live in sin. When thou goest
forth, then, beware of one thing—that sin does not meet thee. For this it is which trips us
up. And without this the devil will be able to do us no harm. What sayest thou? Thou seest
a man, and shunnest him as an omen, and dost not see the snare of the devil, how he sets
thee at war with him who has done thee no wrong, how he makes thee the enemy of thy
brother on no just pretext; but God has bidden us love our enemies; but thou art turned
away from him who did thee no wrong, having nothing to charge him with, and dost thou
not consider how great is the absurdity, how great the shame, rather how great is the danger?
Can I speak of anything more absurd? I am ashamed, indeed, and I blush: But for your salvation’s
sake, I am, I am compelled to speak of it. If a virgin meet him he says the day becomes
unsuccessful; but if a harlot meet him, it is propitious, and profitable, and full of much
business; are you ashamed? and do you smite your foreheads, and bend to the ground? But
do not this on account of the words which I have spoken, but of the deeds which have been
done. See then, in this case, how the devil hid his snare, in order that we might turn away
from the modest, but salute and be friendly to the unchaste. For since he has heard Christ
saying that “He who looketh on a woman to desire her, has already committed adultery
with her,”544 and has seen many get the better of unchastity, wishing by another wrong to
cast them again into sin, by this superstitious observance he gladly persuades them to pay
attention to whorish women.</p>
<note type="footnote">544 Matt. v. 28.</note>

<pb n="239"/>
<p>And what is one to say about them who use charms and amulets, and encircle their
heads and feet with golden coins of Alexander of Macedon. Are these our hopes, tell me,
that after the cross and death of our Master, we should place our hopes of salvation on an
image of a Greek king? Dost thou not know what great result the cross has achieved? It has
abolished death, has extinguished sin, has made Hades useless, has undone the power of
the devil, and is it not worth trusting for the health of the body? It has raised up the whole
world, and dost thou not take courage in it? And what wouldest thou be worthy to suffer,
tell me? Thou dost not only have amulets always with thee, but incantations bringing
drunken and half-witted old women into thine house, and art thou not ashamed, and dost
thou not blush, after so great philosophy, to be terrified at such things? and there is a graver
thing than this error. For when we deliver these exhortations, and lead them away, thinking
that they defend themselves, they say, that the woman is a Christian who makes these incantations,
and utters nothing else than the name of God. On this account I especially hate and
turn away from her, because she makes use of the name of God, with a view to ribaldry. For
even the demons uttered the name of God, but still they were demons, and thus they used
to say to Christ, “We know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God,”545 and notwithstanding,
he rebuked them, and drave them away. On this account, then, I beseech you to cleanse
yourselves from this error, and to keep hold of this word as a staff; and just as without sandals,
and cloak, no one of you would choose to go down to the market-place, so without this
word never enter the market-place, but when thou art about to pass over the threshold of
the gateway, say this word first: I leave thy ranks, Satan, and thy pomp, and thy service, and
I join the ranks of Christ. And never go forth without this word. This shall be a staff to thee,
this thine armor, this an impregnable fortress, and accompany this word with the sign of
the cross on thy forehead. For thus not only a man who meets you, but even the devil himself,
will be unable to hurt you at all, when he sees thee everywhere appearing with these weapons;
and discipline thyself by these means henceforth, in order that when thou receivest the
seal546 thou mayest be a well-equipped soldier, and planting thy trophy against the devil,
may receive the crown of righteousness, which may it be the lot of us all to obtain, through
the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom be glory to the Father
and to the Holy Spirit for ever and ever—Amen.</p>

<p>ST. CHRYSOSTOM:
HOMILY I
AGAINST THOSE WHO SAY THAT DEMONS GOVERN HUMAN
AFFAIRS.</p>
<p>HOMILIES II AND III
ON THE POWER OF MAN TO RESIST THE DEVIL.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<head>THREE HOMILIES CONCERNING THE POWER OF
DEMONS.</head>

<div type="commentary" subtype="introduction">
<head>introduction by rev. w. r. w. stephens.</head>
<p>The three following Homilies are closely connected in subject, and the opening sentence
of the third clearly proves that it was delivered two days after the second; but it is impossible
to say whether that which is placed first was really delivered before the other two. It must
however have been spoken at Antioch, since Chrysostom refers at the beginning of it to his
sermons “on the obscurity of prophecies” in which passages occur which clearly imply that
he was not then a Bishop. The second of the three homilies here translated was delivered in
the presence of a Bishop, as is clearly indicated by the commencement, and as the third was
as already mentioned delivered two days after the second we may safely affirm that they
were all spoken at Antioch when Chrysostom was a presbyter there under the Episcopate
of Flavian.</p>
<p>They deal with errors against which Chrysostom throughout his life most strenuously
contended. In an age of great depravity there seem to have been many who tried to excuse
the weak resistance which they made to evil, both in themselves, and in others, by maintaining
that the world was abandoned to the dominion of devils, or to the irresistible course of fate.
To counteract the disastrous effects of such philosophy, which surrendered man to the
current of his passions, it was necessary to insist very boldly and resolutely on the essential
freedom of the will, on moral responsibility, and the duty of vigorous exertion in resisting
temptation. And Chrysostom did this to an extent which some thought carried him perilously
near the errors of the Pelagian heresy. No one however has described in more forcible language
the powerful hold of sin upon human nature, and the insufficiency of man to shake
it off without the assistance of divine grace. What he does most earnestly combat, both in
the following homilies and very many others, is the doctrine that evil was an original integral
part of our nature: he maintains that it is not a substantial inherent force (δύναμις
ἐνυπόστατος). If evil was a part of our nature in this sense it would be no more reprehensible
than natural appetites and affections. We do not try to alter that which is by nature (φύσει):
sin therefore is not by nature, because by means of education, laws, and punishments we
do seek to alter that. Sin comes through defect in the moral purpose (προαίρεσις). Our first
parents fell through indolence of moral purpose (ῥ‹θυμία) and this is the principal cause of
sin now. They marked out a path which has been trodden ever since: the force of will has
been weakened in all their posterity: so that though evil is not an inherent part of man’s
nature yet he is readily inclined to it (ὀξυρῥεπὴς πρὸς κακι€ν); and this tendency must be

<pb n="242"/>
perpetually counteracted by vigorous exertion, and a bracing up of the moral purpose, with
the aid of divine grace. Profoundly convinced therefore on the one hand of a strong and
universal tendency to sin, but on the other of an essential freedom of the will, Chrysostom
sounds alternately the note of warning and encouragement,—warning against that weakness,
indolence, languor of moral purpose which occasions a fall,—encouragement to use to the
full all the powers with which man is gifted, in reliance on God’s forbearance and love, and
on His willingness to help those who do not despair of themselves. Despair is the devil’s
most potent instrument for effecting the ruin of man; for it is that which prevents him from
rising again after he has fallen. St. Paul repented, and, not despairing, became equal to angels:
Judas repenting, but despairing, rushed into perdition.</p>

<head>Homily I.</head>
<p>Against those who say that demons govern human affairs, and who are displeased at the
chastisement of God, and are offended at the prosperity of the wicked and the hardships
of the just.</p>
<p>I indeed was hoping, that from the continuance of my discourse, you would have had
a surfeit of my words: but I see that the contrary is happening: that no surfeit is taking place
from this continuance, but that your desire is increased, that an addition is made not to
your satiety but to your pleasure, that the same thing is happening which the winebibbers
at heathen drinking-bouts experience; for they, the more they pour down unmixed wine,
so much the rather they kindle their thirst, and in your case the more teaching we inculcate,
so much the rather do we kindle your desire, we make your longing greater, your love for
it the stronger. On this account, although I am conscious of extreme poverty, I do not cease
to imitate the ostentatious among entertainers, both setting before you my table continuously,
and placing on it the cup of my teaching, filled full: for I see that after having drunk it all,
you retire again thirsting. And this indeed has become evident during the whole time, but
especially since the last Lord’s Day: For that ye partake of the divine oracles insatiably, that
day particularly shewed: whereon I discoursed about the unlawfulness of speaking ill one
of another, when I furnished you with a sure subject for self accusation, suggesting that you
should speak ill of your own sins, but should not busy yourselves about those of other people:
when I brought forward the Saints as accusing themselves indeed, but sparing others: Paul
saying I am the chief of sinners, and that God had compassion on him who was a blasphemer,
and a persecutor, and injurious,547 and calling himself one born out of due time, and not
even thinking himself worthy of the title of Apostle:548 Peter saying “Depart from me because
I am a sinful man:”549 Matthew styling himself a publican even in the days of his Apostleship:
550 David crying out and saying “My iniquities have gone over my head, and as a heavy
burden have been burdensome to me:”551 and Isaiah lamenting and bewailing “I am unclean,
and have unclean lips:”552 The three children in the furnace of fire, confessing and saying
that they have sinned and transgressed, and have not kept the commandments of God.
Daniel again makes the same lamentation. When after the enumeration of these Saints, I
called their accusers flies, and introduced the right reason for the comparison, saying, that
<note type="footnote">547 1 Tim. i. 13, 15.</note>
<note type="footnote">548 1 Cor. xv. 8, 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">549 Luke v. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">550 Matt. x. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">551 Ps. xxxvii. 5.</note>
<note type="footnote">552 Isa. vi. 5.</note>

<pb n="244"/>
just as they fasten themselves upon the wounds of others, so also the accusers bite at other
people’s sins, collecting disease therefrom for their acquaintance, and those who do the
opposite, I designated bees, not gathering together diseases, but building honeycombs with
the greatest devotion, and so flying to the meadow of the virtue of the Saint: Then accordingly—
then ye shewed your insatiable longing. For when my discourse was extended to
some length, yea to an interminable length, such as never was, many indeed expected that
your eagerness would be quenched by the abundance of what was said. But the contrary
happened. For your heart was the rather warmed, your desire was the rather kindled: and
whence was this evident? The acclamations at least which took place at the end were greater,
and the shouts more clear, and the same thing took place as at the forge. For as there at the
beginning indeed the light of the fire is not very clear, but when the flame has caught the
whole of the wood that is laid upon it, it is raised to a great height; so also accordingly this
happened on the occasion of that day. At the beginning indeed, this assembly was not
vehemently stirred by me. But when the discourse was extended to some length, and
gradually took hold of all the subjects and the teaching spread more widely, then accordingly,
then the desire of listening was kindled in you, and the applause broke forth, more vehemently.
On this account, although I had been prepared to say less than was spoken, I then
exceeded the measure, nay rather I never exceeded the measure. For I am wont to measure
the amount of the teaching not by the multitude of the words spoken, but by the disposition
of the audience. For he who meets with a disgusted audience, even if he abridge his teaching,
seems to be vexatious, but he who meets with eager, and wide-awake, and attentive hearers,
though he extend his discourse to some length, not even thus fulfils their desire.</p>
<p>But since it happens that there are in so great a congregation, certain weak ones, unable
to follow the length of the discourse, I wish to suggest this to them, that they should hear
and receive, as much as they can, and having received enough should retire: There is no one
who forbids, or compels them to remain beyond their natural strength. Let them not however
necessitate the abridgement of the discourse before the time and the proper hours. Thou
art replete, but thy brother still hungers. Thou art drunk with the multitude of the things
spoken, but thy brother is still thirsty. Let him then not distress thy weakness, compelling
thee to receive more than thine own power allows: nor do thou vex his zeal by preventing
him from receiving all that he can take in.</p>
<p>2. This also happens at secular feasts. Some indeed are more quickly satisfied, some
more tardily, and neither do these blame those, nor do they condemn these. But there indeed
to withdraw more quickly is praiseworthy, but here to withdraw more quickly is not
praiseworthy, but excusable. There to leave off more slowly, is culpable and faulty, here to
withdraw more tardily, brings the greatest commendation, and good report. Pray why is
this? Because there indeed the tardiness arises from greediness, but here the endurance, and
patience are made up of spiritual desire and divine longing.</p>

<pb n="245"/>
<p>But enough of preamble. And we will proceed hereupon to that business which remained
over to us from that day. What then was that which was then spoken? that all men had one
speech, just as also they had one nature, and no one was different in speech, or in tongue.
Whence then comes so great a distinction in speech? From the carelessness of those who
received the gift—of both of which matters we then spoke, shewing both the lovingkindness
of the Master through this unity of speech, and the senselessness of the servants through
their distinction of speech. For he indeed foreseeing that we should waste the gift nevertheless
gave it: and they to whom it was entrusted, waxed evil over their charge. This is then one
way of explanation, not that God wrested the gift from us but that we wasted what had been
given. Then next after that, that we received afterwards gifts greater than those lost. In place
of temporal toil he honoured us with eternal life. In place of thorns and thistles he prepared
the fruit of the Spirit to grow in our souls. Nothing was more insignificant than man, and
nothing became more honoured than man. He was the last item of the reasonable creation.
But the feet became the head, and by means of the first-fruits, were raised to the royal throne.
For just as some generous and opulent man who has seen some one escape from shipwreck
and only able to save his bare body from the waves, cradles him in his hands, and casts about
him a bright garment, and conducts him to the highest honours; so also God has done in
the case of our nature. Man cast aside all that he had, his right to speak freely, his communion
with God, his sojourn in Paradise, his unclouded life, and as from a shipwreck, went forth
bare. But God received him and straightway clothed him, and taking him by the hand
gradually conducted him to heaven. And yet the shipwreck was quite unpardonable. For
this tempest was due entirely not to the force of the winds, but to the carelessness of the
sailor.</p>
<p>And yet God did not look at this, but had compassion for the magnitude of the calamity,
and him who had suffered shipwreck in harbour, he received as lovingly as if he had undergone
this in the midst of the open sea. For to fall in Paradise is to undergo shipwreck in
harbour. Why so? Because when no sadness, or care, or labours, or toil, or countless waves
of desire assaulted our nature, it was upset and it fell. And as the miscreants who sail the
sea, often bore through the ship with a small iron tool, and let in the whole sea to the ship
from below; so accordingly then, when the Devil saw the ship of Adam, that is his soul, full
of many good things, he came and bored it through with his mere voice, as with some small
iron tool, and emptied him of all his wealth and sank the ship itself. But God made the gain
greater than the loss, and brought our nature to the royal throne. Wherefore Paul cries out
and says, “He raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him, on his right hand in the
heavenly places, that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in

<pb n="246"/>
kindness towards us.”553 What dost thou say? the thing has already happened and has an
end, and dost thou say “in order that he might shew to the ages to come?” Has he not shewn?
He has already shewn, but not to all men, but to me who am faithful, but the unbelieving
has not yet seen the wonder. But then, in that day the whole nature of man will come forward,
and will wonder at that which has been done, but especially will it be more manifest to us.
For we believe even now; but hearing and sight do not put a wonder before us in the same
way, but just as in the case of kings when we hear of the purple robe, and the diadem, and
the golden raiment, and the royal throne, we wonder indeed, but experience this in greater
degree when the curtains are drawn aside and we see him seated on the lofty judgment seat.
So also in the case of the Only-Begotten, when we see the curtains of heaven drawn aside,
and the King of angels descending thence, and with his body-guard of the heavenly hosts,
then we perceive the wonder to be greater from our sight of it. For consider with me what
it is to see our nature borne upon the Cherubim, and the whole angelic force surrounding
it.</p>
<p>3. But look, with me, too, at the wisdom of Paul, how many expressions he seeks for, so
as to present to us the lovingkindness of God. For he did not speak merely the word grace,
nor riches, but what did he say? “The exceeding riches of his grace in kindness.”554 But
notwithstanding even so, he is below the mark; and even as the slippery bodies when grasped
by countless hands, escape our hold, and slip through easily; so also are we unable to get
hold of the lovingkindness of God in whatever expressions we may try to grasp it, but the
exceeding magnitude of it baffles the feebleness of our utterances. And Paul therefore experiencing
this, and seeing the force of words defeated by its magnitude, desists after saying
one word: and what is this? “Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.”555 For neither
speech, nor any mind is able to set forth the tender care of God. On this account he then
says that it is past finding out, and elsewhere “The peace of God which passeth all understanding
shall keep your hearts.”556</p>
<p>But, as I was saying, these two ways of explanation are found in the meantime: one indeed
that God has not wrested the gift that we have lost; and next, that the good things which
have been given to us are even greater than those which we have lost. And I wish also to
mention a third too. What then is the third? That even if he had not given the things after
these, which were greater than those we had lost, but had only taken away what had been
given to us, as we furnished the reason why, (for let this be added); even this is enough of
itself to shew his tender care towards us. For not only to give, but also to take away what
<note type="footnote">553 Eph. ii. 6, 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">554 Eph. ii. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">555 2 Cor. ix. 15.</note>
<note type="footnote">556 Phil. iv. 7.</note>

<pb n="247"/>
was given, is a mark of the greatest lovingkindness, and, if you will, let us lay bare the matter,
in the case of Paradise. He gave Paradise. This of his own tender care. We were seen to be
unworthy of the gift. This of our own senselessness. He took away the gift from those who
became unworthy of it. This came of his own goodness. And what kind of goodness is it,
says one, to take away the gift? Wait, and thou shalt fully hear. For think, what Cain would
have been, dwelling in Paradise after his bloodguiltiness. For if, when he was expelled from
that abode, if when condemned to toil and labour, and beholding the threat of death hanging
over his head, if seeing the calamity of his father before his eyes, and holding the traces of
the wrath of God still in his hands, and encompassed with so great horrors, he lashed out
into such great wickedness, as to ignore nature, and to forget one born from the same birth
pangs, and to slay him who had done him no wrong, to lay hold on his brother’s person,
and to dye his right hand with blood, and when God wanted him to be still, to refuse submission
and to affront his maker, to dishonour his parents; if this man had continued to
dwell in Paradise—look, into how great evil he would have rushed. For if when so many
restraints were laid upon him, he leapt with fatal leaps; and if these walls were set at nought,
whither would he not have precipitated himself?</p>
<p>Wouldest thou learn too from the mother of this man, what a good result the expulsion
from the life of Paradise had, compare what Eve was before this, and what she became afterwards.
Before this indeed, she considered that deceiving Devil, that wicked Demon to be
more worth believing than the commandments of God, and at the mere sight of the tree,
she trampled under foot the law which had been laid down by Him. But when the expulsion
from Paradise came, consider how much better and wiser she grew. For when she bare a
son, she says “I have gotten a man through the Lord.”557 She straightway flew to the master,
who before this had despised the master, and she neither ascribes the matter to nature, nor
puts the birth down to the laws of marriage, but she recognizes the Lord of Nature, and acknowledges
thanks to Him for the birth of the little child. And she who before this deceived
her husband, afterwards even trained the little child, and gave him a name which of itself
was able to bring the gift of God to her remembrance: and again when she bare another,
she says “God hath raised up seed to me in place of Abel whom Cain slew.”558 The woman
remembers her calamity, and does not become impatient but she gives thanks to God, and
calls the little child after his gift, furnishing it with constant material for instruction. Thus
even in his very deprivation God conferred greater benefit. The woman suffered expulsion
from Paradise, but by means of her ejection she was led to a knowledge of God, so that she
found a greater thing than she lost. And if it were profitable, says one, to suffer expulsion
from Paradise, for what cause did God give Paradise at the beginning? This turned out
<note type="footnote">557 Gen. iv. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">558 Gen. iv. 25.</note>

<pb n="248"/>
profitably to man, on account of our carelessness, since, if at least, they had taken heed to
themselves, and had acknowledged their master, and had known how to be self-restrained,
and to keep within bounds, they would have remained in honour. But when they treated
the gifts which had been given them with insolence, then it became profitable, that they
should be ejected. For what cause then did God give at first? In order that he might shew
forth his own lovingkindness, and because He himself was prepared to bring us even to
greater honour. But we were the cause of chastisement and punishment on all sides, ejecting
ourselves through our indifference to goods which were given to us. Just as therefore an affectionate
father, at first indeed, suffers his own son to dwell in his home, and to enjoy all
his father’s goods, but when he sees that he has become worthless of the honour, he leads
him away from his table, and puts him far from his own sight, and often casts him forth
from his paternal home, in order that he, suffering expulsion, and becoming better by this
slight and this dishonour, may again shew himself worthy of restoration, and may succeed
to his father’s inheritance: So has God done. He gave Paradise to man. He cast him out when
he appeared unworthy, in order that by his dwelling outside, and through his dishonour,
he might become better, and more self-restrained, and might appear worthy again of restoration.
Since after those things he did become better, he brings him back again and says “Today
shalt thou be with me in Paradise.”559 Dost thou see that not the gift of Paradise but
even the ejection from Paradise was a token of the greatest tender care? For had he not
suffered expulsion from Paradise, he would not again have appeared worthy of Paradise.</p>
<p>4. This argument therefore let us maintain throughout, and let us apply it to the case of
the subject lying before us. God gave a speech common to all. This is part of his loving
kindness to men. They did not use the gift rightly, but they lapsed to utter folly. He took
away again that which had been given. For if when they had one speech, they fell into so
great folly, as to wish to build a tower to heaven: had they not immediately been chastised
would they not have desired to lay hold on the height of heaven itself? For why? If indeed
that were impossible for them, yet notwithstanding their impious thoughts are made out
from their plan. All which things God foresaw, and since they did not use their oneness of
speech rightly, he rightly divided them by difference of speech. And see with me, his lovingkindness.
“Behold,” saith he “they all have one speech, and this they have begun to do.”560</p>
<p>For what reason did he not at once proceed to the division of tongues, but first of all
defend himself, as if about to be judged in a lawcourt? And yet at least no one can say to
him why hast thou thus done? yea he is at liberty to do all things as he wills. But still as one
about to give account, he thus sets up a defence, teaching us to be gentle and loving. For if
the master defends himself to his servants, even when they have done him this wrong; much
<note type="footnote">559 Luke xxiii. 43.</note>
<note type="footnote">560 Gen. xi. 6.</note>

<pb n="249"/>
more ought we to defend ourselves to one another, even if we are wronged to the highest
degree. See at least how he defends himself. “Behold they have all one mouth and one speech”
saith he, “and this they have begun to do,” as if he said let no one accuse me of this when
he sees the division of tongues. Let no one consider that this difference of speech was made
over to men from the beginning. “Behold they all have one mouth, and one speech.” But
they did not use the gift aright. And in order that thou mayest understand that he does not
chastise for what has taken place so much as he provides for improvement in the future,
hear the sequel “and now none of all the things will fail them, which they set on foot to
do.”561 Now what he says, is of such a kind as this. If they do not pay the penalty now, and
be restrained from the very root of their sins, they will never cease from wickedness. For
this is what “none of the things will fail them which they set on foot to do” means, as if he
said, and they will add other deeds yet more monstrous. For such a thing is wickedness; if
when it has taken a start it be not hindered, as fire catching wood, so it rises to an unspeakable
height. Dost thou see that the deprivation of oneness of speech was a work of much lovingkindness?
He inflicted difference of speech upon them, in order that they might not fall into
greater wickedness. Hold fast this argument then with me, and let it ever be fixed and immoveable
in your minds, that not only when he confers benefits but even when he chastises
God is good and loving. For even his chastisements and his punishments are the greatest
part of his beneficence, the greatest form of his providence. Whenever therefore thou seest
that famines have taken place, and pestilences, and drought and immoderate rains, and irregularities
in the atmosphere, or any other of the things which chasten human nature, be
not distressed, nor be despondent, but worship Him who caused them, marvel at Him for
His tender care. For He who does these things is such that He even chastens the body that
the soul may become sound. Then does God these things saith one? God does these things,
and even if the whole city, nay even if the whole universe were here I will not shrink from
saying this. Would that my voice were clearer than a trumpet, and that it were possible to
stand in a lofty place, and to cry aloud to all men, and to testify that God does these things.
I do not say these things in arrogance but I have the prophet standing at my side, crying
and saying, “There is no evil in the city which the Lord hath not done”562—now evil is an
ambiguous term; and I wish that you shall learn the exact meaning of each expression, in
order that on account of ambiguity you may not confound the nature of the things, and fall
into blasphemy.</p>
<p>5. There is then evil, which is really evil; fornication, adultery, covetousness, and the
countless dreadful things, which are worthy of the utmost reproach and punishment. Again
there is evil, which rather is not evil, but is called so, famine, pestilence, death, disease, and
<note type="footnote">561 Gen. xi. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">562 Amos iii. 6.</note>

<pb n="250"/>
others of a like kind. For these would not be evils. On this account I said they are called so
only. Why then? Because, were they evils, they would not have become the sources of good
to us, chastening our pride, goading our sloth, and leading us on to zeal, making us more
attentive. “For when,” saith one, “he slew them, then they sought him, and they returned,
and came early to God.”563 He calls this evil therefore which chastens them, which makes
them purer, which renders them more zealous, which leads them on to love of wisdom; not
that which comes under suspicion and is worthy of reproach; for that is not a work of God,
but an invention of our own will, but this is for the destruction of the other. He calls then
by the name of evil the affliction, which arises from our punishment; thus naming it not in
regard to its own nature, but according to that view which men take of it. For since we are
accustomed to call by the name of evil, not only thefts and adulteries, but also calamities;
so he has called the matter, according to the estimate of mankind. This then is that which
the prophet saith “There is no evil in the city which the Lord hath not done.” This too by
means of Isaiah God has made clear saying “I am God who maketh peace and createth
evil,”564 again naming calamities evils. This evil also Christ hints at, thus saying to the disciples,
“sufficient for the day is the evil thereof,”565 that is to say the affliction, the misery.
It is manifest then on all sides, that he here calls punishment evil; and himself brings these
upon us, affording us the greatest view of his providence. For the physician is not only to
be commended when he leads forth the patient into gardens and meadows, nor even into
baths and pools of water, nor yet when he sets before him a well furnished table, but when
he orders him to remain without food, when he oppresses him with hunger and lays him
low with thirst, confines him to his bed, both making his house a prison, and depriving him
of the very light, and shadowing his room on all sides with curtains, and when he cuts, and
when he cauterizes, and when he brings his bitter medicines, he is equally a physician. How
is it not then preposterous to call him a physician who does so many evil things, but to
blaspheme God, if at any time He doeth one of these things, if He bring on either famine
or death, and to reject his providence over all? And yet He is the only true physician both
of souls and bodies. On this account He often seizes this nature of ours wantoning in
prosperity, and travailing with a fever of sins, and by want, and hunger, and death and
other calamities and the rest of the medicines of which He knows, frees us from diseases.
But the poor alone feel hunger, says one. But He does not chasten with hunger alone, but
with countless other things. Him who is in poverty He has often corrected with hunger, but
the rich and him who enjoys prosperity, with dangers, diseases, untimely deaths. For He is
full of resources, and the medicines which He has for our salvation are manifold.</p>
<note type="footnote">563 Ps. lxxviii. 34.</note>
<note type="footnote">564 Isa. xlv. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">565 Matt. vi. 34.</note>

<pb n="251"/>
<p>Thus too the judges do. They do not honour, or crown those only who dwell in cities,
nor do they provide gifts alone, but they also often correct. On this account both the sword
is sharpened by them, and tortures are prepared; both the wheel and the stocks, and the
executioners, and countless other forms of chastisement. That which the executioner is to
the judges, famine is to God—as an executioner correcting us and leading us away from
vice. This too, it is possible to see in the case of the husbandmen: They do not then, only
protect the root of the vine, nor hedge it round but prune it, and lop off many of the branches;
on this account not only have they a hoe, but a sickle too, suitable for cutting: yet notwithstanding
we do not find fault with them, but then above all we admire them, when we see
them cutting off much that is unserviceable, so as through the rejection of what is superfluous
to afford great security to that which remains. How is it not then preposterous, that we
should thus approve of a father indeed and a physician and a judge, and a husbandman,
and should neither blame nor censure him who casts his son out of his house nor the
physician who puts his patient to torture nor the judge who corrects, nor the husbandman
who prunes: but that we should blame and smite with countless accusations God, if he would
at any time raise us up, when we are as it were, besotted through the great drunkenness
which comes of wickedness? How great madness would it not be, not even to allow God a
share of the same self-justification, of which we allow our fellow servants a share?</p>
<p>6. Fearing these things for them who reproach God, I speak now, in order that they may
not kick against the pricks, and cover their own feet with blood, that they may not throw
stones to heaven, and receive wounds on their own head. But I have somewhat else far
beyond this to say. For omitting to ask (I say this by way of concession) if God took from
us to our profit, I only say this; that if He took what had been given, not even thus, could
anyone be able to reproach Him. For He was Lord of his own. Among men indeed, when
they entrust us with money, and lend us silver, we give them our thanks for the time during
which they lent it, we are not indignant at the time at which they take back their own. And
shall we reproach God who wishes to take back his own? Indeed now is this not the extreme
of folly? yea the great and noble Job did not act thus. For not only when he received, but
even when he was deprived, he gives the greatest thanks to God saying, “The Lord gave, the
Lord hath taken away; may the name of the Lord be blessed for ever.”566 But if it is right to
give thanks for both these even separately, and deprivation is not the less serviceable than
bestowal; what excusableness should we have, tell me, in recompensing in a contrary spirit,
and being impatient with Him when we ought to worship, who is so gentle, and loving and
careful, who is wiser than every Physician, and more full of affection than any father, juster
than any judge, and more anxious than any husbandman, in healing these souls of ours?
What then could be more insane and senseless than they who in the midst of so great good
<note type="footnote">566 Job i. 21.</note>

<pb n="252"/>
order, say that we are deprived of the providence of God? For just as if some one were to
contend that the soul was murky and cold, he would produce an example of extreme insanity,
by his opinion; so if any one doubts about the providence of God, much rather is he liable
to charges of madness.</p>
<p>Not so manifest is the Sun, as the providence of God is clear. But nevertheless some
dare to say that Demons administer our affairs. What can I do? Thou hast a loving Master.
He chooses rather to be blasphemed by thee through these words, than to commit thine affairs
to the Demons and persuade thee by the reality how Demons administer. For then thou
wouldest know their wickedness well by the experience of it. But rather indeed now it is
possible to set it before you as it were by a certain small example. Certain men possessed of
Demons coming forth out of the tombs met Christ, and the Demons kept beseeching him
to suffer them to enter the herd of swine. And he suffered them, and they went away, and
straightway precipitated them all headlong.567 Thus do Demons govern; and yet to them
the swine were of no particular account, but with thee there is ever a warfare without a truce,
and an implacable fight, and undying hatred. And if in the case of those with whom they
had nothing in common they did not even endure that they should be allowed a brief
breathing space of time: if they had gotten unto their power us their enemies who are perpetually
stinging them what would they not have done? and what incurable mischief would
they not have accomplished? For for this reason God let them fall upon the herd of swine,
in order that in the case of the bodies of irrational animals thou mayest learn their wickedness,
and that they would have done to the possessed the things which they did to the swine, had
not the demoniacs in their very madness experienced the providence of God, is evident to
all: and now therefore when thou seest a man excited by a Demon, worship the Master.
Learn the wickedness of the Demons. For it is possible to see both things in the case of these
Demons, the lovingkindness of God, and the evil of the Demons. The evil of the Demons
when they harass and disturb the soul of the demented: and the lovingkindness of God
whenever he restrains and hinders so savage a Demon, who has taken up his abode within,
and desires to hurl the man headlong, and does not allow him to use his own power to the
full, but suffers him to exhibit just so much strength, as both to bring the man to his senses,
and make his own wickedness apparent. Dost thou wish to form another example to see
once more how a Demon arranges matters when God allows him to use his own power?
Consider the herds, the flocks of Job, how in one instant of time he annihilated all, consider
the pitiable death of the children, the blow that was dealt to his body: and thou shalt see the
savage and inhuman and unsparing character of the wickedness of the Demons, and from
these things thou shalt know clearly that if God had entrusted the whole of this world to
their authority, they would have confused and disturbed everything, and would have assigned
<note type="footnote">567 Matt. viii. 28 sqq.</note>

<pb n="253"/>
to us their treatment of the swine, and of those herds, since not even for a little breathing
space of time could they have endured to spare us our salvation. If Demons were to arrange
affairs, we should be in no better condition than possessed men, yea rather we should be
worse than they. For God did not give them over entirely to the tyranny of the Demons,
otherwise they would suffer far worse things than these which they now suffer. And I would
ask this of those who say these things, what kind of disorder they behold in the present, that
they set down all our affairs to the arrangement of Demons? And yet we behold the sun for
so many years proceeding day by day in regular order, a manifold band of stars keeping
their own order, the courses of the moon unimpeded, an invariable succession of night and
day, all things, both above and below, as it were in a certain fitting harmony, yea rather even
far more, and more accurately each keeping his own place, and not departing from the order
which God who made them ordained from the beginning.</p>
<p>7. And what is the use of all this, says one, when the heaven indeed, and sun, and moon,
and the band of stars, and all the rest keep much good order, but our affairs are full of confusion
and disorder. What kind of confusion, O man, and disorder? A certain one, says he,
is rich, and overbearing, He is rapacious and covetous, he drains the substance of the poor
day by day, and suffers no terrible affliction. Another lives in forbearance, self-restraint,
and uprightness, and is adorned with all other good qualities, and is chastened with poverty
and disease, and extremely terrible afflictions. Are these then the matters which offend thee?
Yes, these, says he. If then thou seest both of the rapacious, many chastened, and of those
living virtuously, yea some even enjoying countless goods, why dost thou not abandon thine
opinion, and be content with the Almighty? Because it is this very thing which offends me
more. For why when there are two evil men, is one chastened, and another gets off, and escapes;
and when there are two good men, one is honoured, and the other continues under
punishment? And this very thing is a very great work of God’s providence. For if he were
to chasten all the evil men, here; and were to honour here all the good men, a day of judgment
were superfluous. Again if he were to chasten no wicked man, nor were to honour any of
the good, then the base would become baser and worse, as being more careless than the excellent,
and they who were minded to blaspheme would accuse God all the more, and say
that our affairs were altogether deprived of his providence. For if when certain evil men are
chastened, and certain good men punished, they likewise say that human affairs are subject
to no providence; if even this did not happen what would they not say? and what words
would they not send forth? On this account some of the wicked he chastens, and some he
does not chasten and some of the good he honours and some he does not honour. He does
not chasten all, in order that he may persuade thee, that there is a Resurrection. But he
chastens some in order that he may make the more careless, through fear by means of the
punishment of the others, more in earnest. Again he honours certain of the good, in order
that he may lead on others by his honours to emulate their virtue. But he does not honour

<pb n="254"/>
all, in order that thou mayest learn that there is another season for rendering to all their
recompense. For if indeed all were to receive their deserts here, they would disbelieve the
account of the Resurrection. But if no one were to receive his desert here, the majority would
become more careless. On this account some he chastens, and others he does not chasten,
profiting both those who are chastened, and those who are not chastened. For he separates
their wickedness from those, and he makes the others by their punishment, more self-restrained.
And this is manifest from what Christ himself said. For when they announced to
him that a tower had been brought to the ground, and had buried certain men, he saith to
them “What think ye? that these men were sinners only? I say to you nay, but if ye do not
repent ye also shall suffer the same thing.”568</p>
<p>Dost thou see how those perished on account of their sin, and the rest did not escape
on account of their righteousness, but in order that they might become better by the punishment
of the others? Were not then the chastened unjustly dealt with says one? For they
could without being chastened themselves become better by the punishment of others. But
if He had known that they would become better from penitence God would not have
chastened them. For if when he foresaw that many would profit nothing from his longsuffering,
he nevertheless bears with them, with much tolerance, fulfilling his own part, and
affording them an opportunity of coming out of their own senselessness to their sober senses
one day; how could he deprive those who were about to become better from the punishment
of others, of the benefit of repentance? So that they are in no way unjustly treated, both their
evil being cut off by their punishment, and their chastening is to be lighter there, because
they suffered here beforehand. Again, they who were not chastened are in no way unjustly
treated; for it was possible for them, had they wished, to have used the longsuffering of God,
to accomplish a most excellent change, and wondering at his tolerance, to have become
ashamed at his exceeding forbearance, and one day to have gone over to virtue, and to have
gained their own salvation by the punishment of others. But if they remain in wickedness,
God is not to blame, who on this account was longsuffering, that he might recover them,
but they are unworthy of pardon, who did not rightly use the longsuffering of God: and it
is not only possible to use this argument as a reason why all the wicked are not chastened
here, but another also not less than this. Of what kind then is this? That if God brought
upon all, the chastenings which their sins deserved, our race would have been carried off,
and would have failed to come down to posterity. And in order that thou mayest learn that
this is true, hear the prophet saying “If Thou observedst iniquity O Lord, who shall stand?”569
And if it seems good to thee to investigate this saying, leaving the accurate enquiry into the
life of each, alone: (For it is not possible even to know all that has been accomplished by
<note type="footnote">568 Luke xiii. 4.</note>

<pb n="255"/>
each man) let us bring forward those sins which all, without contradiction, commit: and
from these it will be plain and manifest to us, that if we were chastened for each of our sins,
we should long ago have perished. He who has called his brother fool, “is liable to the hell
of fire” saith He.570 Is there then any one of us who has never sinned this sin? What then?
ought he to be straightway carried off? Therefore we should have been all carried off and
would have disappeared, long ago, indeed very long ago. Again he who swears, saith he,
even if he fulfil his oath, doeth the works of the wicked one.571 Who is there then, who has
not sworn? Yea rather who is there who has never sworn falsely? He who looketh on a woman,
saith he, with unchaste eyes,572 is wholly an adulterer, and of this sin any one would find
many guilty. When then these acknowledged sins are such and so insufferable, and each of
these of itself brings upon us inevitable chastisement, if we were to reckon up the secret sins
committed by us, then we shall see especially that the providence of God does not bring
upon us punishment for each sin. So that when thou seest anyone rapacious, covetous, and
not chastened, then do thou unfold thine own conscience; reckon up thine own life, go over
the sins which have been committed and thou shalt learn rightly that in thine own case first,
it is not expedient to be chastened for each of thy sins: for on this account the majority make
reckless utterances, since they do not look on their own case before that of others, but we
all leaving our own alone, examine that of the rest. But let us no longer do this, but the reverse,
and if thou seest any righteous man chastened, remember Job: for if any one be righteous,
he will not be more righteous than that man, nor within a small distance of approaching
him. And if he suffer countless ills, he has not yet suffered so much, as that man.</p>
<p>8. Taking this then into thy mind, cease charging the master; learning that it is not by
way of deserting him does God let such an one suffer ill, but through desire to crown him,
and make him more distinguished. And if thou seest a sinner punished, remember the
paralytic who passed thirty eight years on his bed. For that that man was delivered over then
to that disease through sin, hear Christ saying “Behold thou art made whole; sin no more
lest a worse thing happen to thee.”573 For either when we are chastened, we pay the penalty
of our sins, or else we receive the occasion of crowning if, when we live in rectitude, we
suffer ill. So that whether we live in righteousness, or in sins, chastening is a useful thing
for us, sometimes making us more distinguished, sometimes rendering us more self-con-

trolled, and lightening our punishment to come for us. For that it is possible that one
chastened here, and bearing it thankfully should experience milder punishment there hear
St. Paul saying “For this reason many are weak and sickly, and some sleep. For if we judged
ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged we are corrected by the Lord,
that we should not be condemned with the world.”574 Knowing all these things therefore,
Let us both moralize in this way on the providence of God, and stop the mouths of the
gainsayers. And if any of the events which happen pass our understanding, let us not from
this consider that our affairs are not governed by providence, but perceiving His providence
in part, in things incomprehensible let us yield to the unsearchableness of His wisdom. For
if it is not possible for one not conversant with it to understand a man’s art, much rather is
it impossible for the human understanding to comprehend the infinity of the providence
of God. “For his judgments are unsearchable and his ways past finding out.”575 But nevertheless
from small portions we gain a clear and manifest faith about the whole, we give
thanks to him for all that happens. For there is even another consideration that cannot be
contradicted, for those who wish to moralize about the providence of God. For we would
ask the gainsayers, is there then a God? and if they should say there is not, let us not answer
them. For just as it is worthless to answer madmen, so too those who say there is no God.
For if a ship having few sailors, and passengers, would not be conducted safely for one mile
even, without the hand which guides it, much more, such a world as this, having so many
persons in it, composed of different elements, would not have continued so long a time,
were there not a certain providence presiding over it, both governing, and continually
maintaining this whole fabric, and if in shame, through the common opinion of all men,
and the experience of affairs, they confess that there is a God, let us say this to them. If there
is a God, as indeed there is, it follows that He is just, for if He is not just neither is He God,
and if He is just He recompenses to each according to their desert. But we do not see all
here receiving according to their desert. Therefore it is necessary to hope for some other
requital awaiting us, in order that by each one receiving according to his desert, the justice
of God may be made manifest. For this consideration does not only contribute to our wisdom
about providence alone, but about the Resurrection; and let us teach others, and let us do
all diligence to shut the mouths of them who rave against the master, and let us ourselves
glorify him in all things. For thus shall we win more of his care, and enjoy much of his influence,
and thus shall we be able to escape from real evil, and obtain future good, through the
grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, By whom and with whom be glory to
the Father, with the Holy Spirit, now and always, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily II.</head>
<p>Against those who object because the devil has not been put out of the world: and to prove
that his wickedness does no harm to us—if we take heed: and concerning repentance.</p>
<p>1. When Isaac, in old time, was desirous to eat a meal at the hands of his son, he sent
his son forth from the house to the chace. But when this Isaac was desirous to accept a meal
at my hands he did not send me forth from the house, but himself ran to our table. What
could be more tenderly affectionate than he? What more humble? who thought fit to shew
his warm love thus, and deigned to descend so far. On this account surely, we also having
spent the tones of our voice, and the strength of our feet over the morning discourse, when
we saw his fatherly face, forgot our weakness, lay aside our fatigue, were uplifted with
pleasure; we saw his illustrious hoary head, and our soul was filled with light. On this account
too, we set out our table with readiness, in order that he should eat and bless us. There is
no fraud and guile, here, as there was then, there. One indeed was commanded to bring the
meal—but another brought it. But I was commanded to bring it, and brought it too. Bless
me then, O my father, with spiritual blessing, which we all also pray ever to receive, and
which is profitable not only to thee, but also to me, and to all these. Entreat the common
master of us all, to prolong thy life to the old age of Isaac. For this is both for me, and for
these, more valuable, and more needful than the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth.</p>
<p>But it is time to proceed to set out our table; what then is this? The remains of what was
lately said with a view to our love of you. For still—still—we renew our discourse concerning
the Devil, which we started two days ago, which we also addressed to the initiated, this
morning when we discoursed to them about renunciation, and covenant. And we do this,
not because our discourse about the Devil is sweet to us, but because the doctrine about
him is full of security for you. For he is an enemy and a foe, and it is a great security to know
clearly, the tactics of your enemies. We have said lately, that he does not overcome by force,
nor by tyranny, nor through compulsion, nor through violence. Since were this so, he would
have destroyed all men. And in testimony of this we brought forward the swine, against
which the Demons were unable to venture anything, before the permission of the Master.576
The herds and flocks of Job. For not even did the Devil venture to destroy these, until he
received power from above. We learned therefore this one thing first, that he does not
overcome us by force, or by compulsion; next after that, we added that even when he overcomes
by deceitfulness, not thus does he get the better of all men, Then again we brought
that athlete Job, himself into the midst, against whom he set countless schemes going, and
not even thus got the better of him, but withdrew defeated. One question still remains. What
then is this matter? That if he does not overcome says one, by force, yet by deceitfulness.
<note type="footnote">576 Matt. viii. 31.</note>

<pb n="258"/>
And on this account it were better that he should be destroyed. For if Job got the better of
him, yet Adam was deceived and overthrown. Now if once for all he had been removed
from the world, Adam would never have been overthrown. But now he remains, and is defeated
indeed by one, but gets the better of many. Ten overcame him, but he himself overcomes
and wrestles down ten thousand and if God took him away from the world, these
ten thousand would not have perished. What then shall we say to this? That first of all they
who overcame are more valuable far than they who are defeated, even if the latter be more,
and the former less. “For better is one,” saith he “that doeth the will of God than ten thousand
transgressors.”577 And next, that if the antagonist were taken away he who overcomes is
thereby injured. For if thou lettest the adversary remain, the more slothful are injured, not
on account of the more diligent, but by their own slothfulness; whereas if thou takest away
the antagonist, the more diligent are betrayed on account of the slothful, and neither exhibit
their own power, nor win crowns.</p>
<p>2. Perhaps ye have not yet understood what has been said. Therefore it is necessary that
I should say it again more clearly. Let there be one antagonist. But let there be also two
athletes about to wrestle against him, and of these two athletes let one be consumed with
gluttony, unprepared, void of strength, nerveless; but the other diligent, of good habit,
passing his time in the wrestling school, in many gymnastic exercises, and exhibiting all the
practice which bears upon the contest. If then thou takest away the antagonist, which of
these two hast thou injured? The slothful, pray, and unprepared, or the earnest one who has
toiled so much? It is quite clear that it is the earnest one: For the one indeed is wronged by
the slothful, after the antagonist has been taken away. But the slothful, while he remains, is
no longer injured on account of the earnest. For he has fallen, owing to his own slothfulness.</p>
<p>I will state another solution of this question, in order that thou mayest learn, that the
Devil does not injure, but their own slothfulness everywhere overthrows those who do not
take heed. Let the Devil be allowed to be exceeding wicked, not by nature, but by choice and
conviction. For that the Devil is not by nature wicked, learn from his very names. For the
Devil, the slanderer that is, is called so from slandering; for he slandered man to God saying
“Doth Job reverence thee for nought? but put out thine hand, and touch what he hath, see
if he will not blaspheme thee to thy face.”578 He slandered God again to man saying “Fire
fell from heaven and burnt up the sheep.”579 For he was anxious to persuade him, that this
warfare was stirred up from above, out of the heavens, and he set the servant at variance
with the master, and the master with his servant; rather he did not set them at variance, but
attempted to indeed, but was not able, in order that whenever thou mayest set another servant

<note type="footnote">578 Job i. 9, 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">579 Job i. 16.</note>

<pb n="259"/>
at variance with his master, Adam with God, and believing the Devil’s slander, thou mayest
learn that he gained strength, not owing to his own power but from that man’s slothfulness
and carelessness. He is called the Devil therefore on that account. But to slander, and to refrain
from slander is not natural, but an action which takes place and which ceases to take
place, occurring and ceasing to occur. Now such things do not reach the rank of the nature
or of the essence of a thing. I know that this consideration about essence and accident is
hard to be grasped by many. But there are they who are able to lend a finer ear, wherefore
also we have spoken these things. Do you wish that I should come to another name? You
shall see that that also is not a name which belongs to his essence or nature. He is called
wicked. But his wickedness is not from his nature, but from his choice. For even this at one
time is present, at another time is absent. Do not thou then say this to me that it always remains
with him. For it was not indeed with him at the beginning, but afterwards came upon
him; wherefore he is called apostate. Although many men are wicked, he alone is called
wicked by pre-eminence. Why then is he thus called? Because though in no way wronged
by us, having no grudge whether small or great, when he saw mankind had in honour, he
straightway envied him his good. What therefore could be worse than this wickedness, except
when hatred and war exist, without having any reasonable cause. Let the Devil then be let
alone, and let us bring forward the creation, in order that thou mayest learn that the Devil
is not the cause of ills to us, if we would only take heed: in order that thou mayest learn that
the weak in choice, and the unprepared, and slothful, even were there no Devil, falls, and
casts himself into many a depth of evil. The Devil is evil. I know it myself and it is acknowledged
by all, yet give heed strictly to the things which are now about to be said. For they
are not ordinary matters, but those about which many words, many times, and in many
places arise, about which there is many a fight and battle not only on the part of the faithful
against unbelievers but also on the part of the faithful against the faithful. For this is that
which is full of pain.</p>
<p>3. The Devil then is acknowledged, as I said, to be evil by all. What shall we say about
this beautiful and wondrous creation? Pray is the creation too, wicked? and who is so corrupt,
who so dull, and demented as to accuse the creation? what then shall we say about this? For
it is not wicked, but is both beautiful and a token of the wisdom and power and lovingkindness
of God. Hear at least how the prophet marvels at it, saying, “How are thy works magnified
O Lord! in wisdom Thou hast made them all.”580 He did go through them one by one,
but withdrew before the incomprehensible wisdom of God. And that he has made it thus
beautiful and vast hear a certain one saying, “From the vastness and beauty of the creatures,
the originator of them is proportionably seen.”581 Hear too Paul saying, “For the invisible
<note type="footnote">580 Ps. civ. 24.</note>
<note type="footnote">581 Wisd. xiii. 5.</note>

<pb n="260"/>
things of Him, since the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being perceived through the
things that are made.”582 For each of these by which he spake declared that the creation
leads us to the knowledge of God, because it causes us to know the Master fully. What then?
If we see this beautiful and wondrous creation itself becoming a cause of impiety to many,
shall we blame it? In no wise, but them who were unable to use the medicine rightly. Whence
then is this which leads us to the knowledge of God, a cause of impiety? “The wise” saith he
“were darkened in their understandings, and worshipped and served the creature more than
the creator.”583 The Devil is nowhere here, a Demon is nowhere here, but the creation alone
is set before us, as the teacher of the knowledge of God. How then has it become the cause
of impiety? Not owing to its own nature, but owing to the carelessness of those who do not
take heed. What then? Shall we take away even the creation? tell me.</p>
<p>And why do I speak about the creation? Let us come to our own members. For even
these we shall find to be a cause of destruction if we do not take heed, not because of their
own nature, but because of our sloth. And look; an eye was given, in order that thou mayest
behold the creation and glorify the Master. But if thou dost not use the eye well, it becomes
to thee the minister of adultery. A tongue has been given, in order that thou mayest speak
well, in order that thou mayest praise the Creator. But if thou givest not excellent heed, it
becomes a cause of blasphemy to thee. And hands were given thee that thou mayest stretch
them forth unto prayer. But if thou are not wary, thou stretchest them out unto covetousness.
Feet were given in order that thou mayest run unto good works, but if thou art careless thou
wilt cause wicked works by means of them: Dost thou see that all things hurt the weak man?
Dost thou see that even the medicines of salvation inflict death upon the weak, not because
of their own nature but because of his weakness? God made the heaven in order that thou
mayest wonder at the work, and worship the master. But others leaving the creator alone,
have worshipped the heaven; and this from their own carelessness and senselessness. But
why do I speak of the creation? assuredly what could be more conducive to salvation than
the Cross? But this Cross has become an offence to the weak. “For the word of the Cross is
to them that are perishing, foolishness: but to those which are being saved, it is the power
of God.”584 And again, “we preach Christ crucified, unto Jews a stumbling-block and unto
Gentiles foolishness.”585 What could be more fit for teaching than Paul, and the apostles?
But the Apostles became a savour of death to many. He says at least “to one a savour from
death unto death: to the other a savour from life unto life.”586 Dost thou see that the weak
is hurt even by Paul, but the strong is injured not even by the Devil?</p>

<note type="footnote">586 2 Cor. ii. 16.</note>

<pb n="261"/>
<p>4. Dost thou wish that we should exercise the argument in the case of Jesus Christ? What
is equal to that salvation? what more profitable than that presence? But this very saving
presence, so profitable, became an additional means of chastening to many. “For for judgment”
saith he “came I into this world, that they which see not may see, and that they which
see may become blind.”587 What dost thou say? The light became a cause of blindness? The
light did not become a cause of blindness, but the weakness of the eyes of the soul was not
able to entertain the light. Thou hast seen that a weak man is hurt on all sides, but the strong
is benefited on all sides. For in every case, the purpose is the cause, in every case the disposition
is master. Since the Devil, if thou wouldest understand it, is even profitable to us, if
we use him aright, and benefits us greatly, and we gain no ordinary advantages; and this,
we shewed in a small degree from the case of Job. And it is possible also to learn this from
Paul: for writing about the fornicator he thus speaks “Deliver such an one unto Satan for
the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved.”588 Behold even the Devil has become
a cause of salvation, but not because of his own disposition, but because of the skill
of the Apostle. For as the physicians taking serpents and cutting off their destructive members,
prepare medicines for antidotes; so also did Paul. He took whatever was profitable of
the chastening that proceeds from the Devil, and left the rest alone; in order that thou
mayest learn that the Devil is not the cause of salvation, but that he hasted to destroy and
devour mankind. But that the Apostle through his own wisdom cut his throat: hear in the
second epistle to the Corinthians, what he saith about this very fornicator, “confirm your
love towards him,” “lest by any means such an one should be swallowed up by over much
sorrow.” And, “we be taken advantage of by Satan.”589 We have snatched beforehand the
man from the gullet of the wild beast, he saith. For the Apostle often used the Devil as an
executioner. For the executioners punish those who have done wrong, not as they choose,
but as the judges allow. For this is the rule for the executioner, to take vengeance, giving
heed to the command of the judge. Dost thou see to what a dignity the Apostle mounted?
He who was invested with a body, used the bodiless as an executioner; and that which their
common master saith to the Devil, concerning Job: charging him thus, “Touch his flesh,
but thou shalt not touch his life;”590 giving him a limit, and measure of vengeance, in order
that the wild beast might not be impetuous and leap upon him too shamelessly; this too the
Apostle does. For delivering the fornicator over to him he says “For the destruction of the
flesh,”591 that is “thou shalt not touch his life.” Dost thou see the authority of the servant?

<note type="footnote">591 1 Cor. v. 5.</note>

<pb n="262"/>
Fear not therefore the Devil, even if he be bodiless: for he has come in contact with him.
And nothing is weaker than he who has come into such contact even though he be not invested
with a body, as then nothing is stronger than he who has boldness even though he
bear about a mortal body.</p>
<p>5. All these things have been now said by me, not in order that I may discharge the
Devil from blame, but that I may free you from slothfulness. For he wishes extremely to attribute
the cause of our sins to himself, in order that we being nourished by these hopes,
and entering on all kinds of evil, may increase the chastening in our own case, and may
meet with no pardon from having transferred the cause to him. Just as Eve met with none.
But let us not do this. But let us know ourselves. Let us know our wounds. For thus shall we
be able to apply the medicines. For he who does not know his disease, will give no care to
his weakness. We have sinned much: I know this well. For we are all liable for penalties. But
we are not deprived of pardon; nor shall we fall away from repentance for we still stand in
the arena, and are in the struggles of repentance. Art thou old, and hast thou come to the
last outlet of life? Do not consider even thus that thou hast fallen from repentance, nor
despair of thine own salvation, but consider the robber who was freed on the cross. For what
was briefer than that hour in which he was crowned? Yet notwithstanding even this was
enough for him, for salvation. Art thou young? Do not be confident in thy youth, nor think
that thou hast a very fixed term of life, “For the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
night.”592 On this account he has made our end invisible, in order that we might make our
diligence and our forethought plain. Dost thou not see men taken away prematurely day
after day? On this account a certain one admonishes “make no tarrying to turn to the Lord
and put not off from day to day,”593 lest at any time, as thou delayest, thou art destroyed.
Let the old man keep this admonition, let the young man take this advice. Yea, art thou in
security, and art thou rich, and dost thou abound in wealth, and does no affliction happen
to thee? Still hear what Paul says “when they say peace and safety, then sudden destruction
cometh upon them.”594 Affairs are full of much change. We are not masters of our end. Let
us be masters of virtue. Our Master Christ is loving.</p>
<p>6. Do you wish that I shall speak of the ways of repentance? They are many, and various,
and different, and all lead to heaven. The first way of repentance is condemnation of sins.
“Declare thou first thy sins that thou mayest be justified.”595 Wherefore also the prophet
said “I said, I will speak out, my transgression to the Lord, and thou remittedst the iniquity
of my heart.”596 Condemn thyself therefore for thy sins. This is enough for the Master by

<note type="footnote">595 Isa. xliii. 26.</note>
<note type="footnote">596 Ps. xxxii. 5.</note>

<pb n="263"/>
way of self-defence. For he who condemns his sins, is slower to fall into them again. Awake
thy conscience, that inward accuser, in order that thou mayest have no accuser at the judgment
seat of the Lord. This is one way of repentance, the best; and there is another not less
than this, not to bear a grudge against thine enemies to overcome anger, to forgive the sins
of our fellow-servants. For so will those which have been done against the master be forgiven
us. See the second expiation of sins: “For if ye forgive” saith he, “your debtors, your Heavenly
Father will also forgive you.”597 Dost thou wish to learn a third way of repentance? Fervent
and diligent prayer, and to do this from the bottom of the heart. Hast thou not seen that
widow, how she persuaded the shameless judge?598 But thou hast a gentle Master, both
tender, and kind. She asked, against her adversaries, but thou dost not ask against thine
adversaries, but on behalf of thine own salvation. And if thou wouldest learn a fourth way,
I will say almsgiving. For this has a great power and unspeakable. For Daniel saith to
Nebuchadnezzar when he had come to all kinds of evil, and had entered upon all impiety,
“O King let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, redeem thy sins by almsgiving and thine
iniquities by compassion on the poor.”599 What could be compared with this lovingkindness?
After countless sins, after so many transgressions, he is promised that he will be reconciled
with him he has come into conflict with if he will show kindness to his own fellow-servants.
And modesty, and humility, not less than all words spoken, exhaust the nature of sins. And
the publican is proof, being unable to declare his good deeds, in sight of all, bringing forward
his humility, and laying aside the heavy burden of his sins.600 See we have shewn five ways
of repentance: first the condemnation of sins, next the forgiveness of our neighbours’ sins,
thirdly that which comes of prayer, fourth that which comes of almsgiving, fifth that which
comes of humility. Do not thou then be lazy; but walk in all these day by day. For the ways
are easy, nor canst thou plead poverty. And even if thou livest poorer than all, thou art able
to leave thine anger, and be humble, and to pray fervently, and to condemn sins, and thy
poverty is in no way a hindrance. And why do I speak thus, when not even in that way of
repentance in which it is possible to spend money (I speak of almsgiving), not even there is
poverty any hindrance to us from obeying the command? The widow who spent the two
mites is a proof.601 Having learned then the healing of our wounds, let us constantly apply
these medicines, in order that we may return to health and enjoy the sacred table with assurance;
and with much glory, reach Christ the king of glory, and attain to everlasting good by
the grace, and compassion, and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with

<head>Homily III.</head>
<p>That evil comes of sloth, and virtue from diligence, and that neither wicked men, nor the
devil himself, are able to do the wary man any harm. The proof of this from many passages,
and amongst others from those which relate to Adam and to Job.</p>
<p>1. The day before yesterday we set on foot our sermon concerning the Devil, out of our
love for you. But others, the day before yesterday while these matters were being set on foot
here, took their places in the theatre, and were looking on at the Devil’s show. They were
taking part in lascivious songs; ye were having a share in spiritual music. They were eating
of the Devil’s garbage: ye were feeding on spiritual unguents. Who pray decoyed them? Who
pray separated them from the sacred flock? Did the Devil pray deceive them? How did he
not deceive you? you and they are men alike; I mean as regards your nature. You and they
have the same soul, you have the same desires, so far as nature is concerned. How is it then
that you and they were not in the same place? Because you and they have not the same
purpose. On this account they indeed are under deception, but you beyond deception. I do
not say these things again as discharging the Devil from accusation, but as desiring earnestly
to free you from sins. The Devil is wicked; I grant this indeed, but he is wicked for himself
not towards us if we are wary. For the nature of wickedness is of this kind. It is destructive
to those alone who hold to it. Virtue is the contrary. It is not only able to profit those who
hold to it, but those nearest at hand too. And in order that thou mayest learn that evil is evil
in itself, but good is also good to others, I provide thee with proverbial evidence: “My son”
saith he “if thou art become evil, thou shall bear thine evils alone, but if wise, for thyself and
thy neighbour.”602</p>
<p>They were deceived in the theatre, but ye were not deceived. This is the greatest proof
of things, a clear testimony, and unquestionable reasoning, that in every case, the purpose
is master. Do thou accordingly use this method of proof, and if thou seest a man living in
wickedness, and exhibiting all kinds of evil; then blaming the providence of God, and saying
that by the necessity of fortune and fate and through tyranny of Demons He gave us our
nature, and on all sides shifting the cause from himself indeed, and transferring it to the
creator who provides for all; silence his speech not by word, but by deed, shewing him another
fellow servant living in virtue and forbearance. There is no need of long speeches, no
need of a complex plan, nor even of syllogisms. By means of deeds the proof is brought
about. He said to him: thou art a servant, and he is a servant; thou art a man and he is a
man. Thou livest in the same world: thou art nourished with the same nourishment under
the same heaven: How is it that thou art living in wickedness, he in virtue? on this account
God allowed the wicked to be mingled with the good; and did not give one law to the wicked
<note type="footnote">602 Prov. ix. 12.</note>

<pb n="266"/>
indeed, and appointed another world as a colony for the good, but mixed these and those;
conferring great benefit. For the good appear more thoroughly approved when they are in
the midst of those who try to hinder them from living rightly, and who entice them to evil,
and yet keep hold of virtue. “For there must” he saith “be also heresies among you that they
which are approved may be made manifest among you.” 603</p>
<p>Therefore also on this account he has left the wicked to be in the world, in order that
the good may shine the brighter. Dost thou see how great is the gain? But the gain is not
owing to the wicked, but owing to the courage of the good. On this account also we admire
Noe, not because he was righteous nor yet because he was perfect alone, but because in that
perverse and wicked generation he preserved his virtue, when he had no pattern of virtue,
when all men invited him to wickedness; and he went his whole way contrary to them, like
some traveller, pursuing his way while the great multitude is being borne along vehemently.
On this account he did not simply say “Noe was just, perfect,” but added “in his generation”
604 in that perverse, that desperate generation, when there was no acquisition of virtue.
To the good indeed then this was the gain from the wicked. Thus at all events, also trees
tossed about by contrary winds, become stronger. And there is a gain to the wicked from
their mixing with the good. They feel confusion, they are ashamed, they blush in their
presence; and even if they do not abstain from evil, yet nevertheless they dare what they
dare with secrecy. And this is no small thing not to have transgression publicly committed.
For the life of the others becomes the accuser of the wickedness of these. Hear at least what
they say about the righteous man. “He is grievous to us, even when beheld,”605 and it is no
small beginning of amendment to be tormented at his presence. For if the sight of the
righteous man did not torment them, this word would not have been uttered. But to be
stung, and pinched in conscience at his presence, would be no little hindrance to indulging
in wickedness with pleasure, Dost thou see how great is the gain both to the good from the
wicked, and to the wicked from the good? On this account God has not set them apart, but
allowed them to be mingled together.</p>
<p>2. Let our argument also about the Devil be the same. For on this account He hath left
him also to be here, in order that he might render thee the stronger, in order that he may
make the athlete more illustrious, in order that the contests may be greater. When therefore
any one says, why has God left the Devil here? say these words to him, because he not only
does no harm to the wary and the heedful, but even profits them, not owing to his own
purpose (for that is wicked), but owing to their courage who have used that wickedness
aright. Since he even fixed upon Job not on this account that he might make him more illus-

<pb n="267"/>
trious, but in order that he might upset him. On this account he is wicked both because of
such an opinion and such a purpose. But notwithstanding he did no harm to the righteous
man, but he rather rejoiced in the conflict as we accordingly shewed. Both the Demon
shewed his wickedness and the righteous man his courage. But he does upset many says
one: owing to their weakness, not owing to his own strength: for this too has been already
proved by many examples. Direct thine own intention aright then, and thou shalt never receive
harm from any, but shall get the greatest gain, not only from the good but even from
the wicked. For on this account, as I have before said, God has suffered men to be with one
another, and especially the wicked with the good, in order that they may bring them over
to their own virtue. Hear at least what Christ saith to his disciples, “The Kingdom of heaven
is like unto a woman who took leaven and hid it in three measures of meal.”606 So that the
righteous have the power of leaven, in order that they may transfer the wicked to their own
manner of conduct. But the righteous are few, for the leaven is small. But the smallness in
no way injures the lump, but that little quantity converts the whole of the meal to itself by
means of the power inherent in it. So accordingly the power also of the righteous has its
force not in the magnitude of their number, but in the grace of the Spirit. There were twelve
Apostles. Dost thou see how little is the leaven? The whole world was in unbelief. Dost thou
see how great is the lump? But those twelve turned the whole world to themselves. The
leaven and the lump had the same nature but not the same manner of conduct. On this account
he left the wicked in the midst of the good, that since they are of the same nature as
the righteous they may also become of the same purpose.</p>
<p>Remember these things. With these stop the mouths of the indolent, the dissolute, the
slothful, the indisposed towards the labours of virtue, those who accuse their common
Master. “Thou hast sinned” he saith “be still.”607 “Do not add a second more grievous sin.”608
It is not so grievous to sin, as after the sin to accuse the Master. Take knowledge of the cause
of the sin, and thou wilt find that it is none other than thyself who hast sinned. Everywhere
there is a need of a good intention. I have shewn you this not from simple reasoning only,
but from the case of fellow-servants living in the world itself. Do thou also use this proof.
Thus too our common master will judge us. Learn this method of proof, and no one will be
able to reason with you. Is any a fornicator? Shew him another who is self-restrained. Is any
covetous and rapacious? Shew him one who gives alms. Does he live in jealousy and envy?
Shew him one clean from passion. Is he overcome by anger? Bring into the midst one who
is living in wisdom, for we must not only have recourse to ancient example, but take our
models from present times. For even to-day by the grace of God, good deeds are done not

<pb n="268"/>
less than of old. Is a man incredulous? and does he think that the scriptures are false? Does
he not believe that Job was such as he was? Shew him another man, emulating the life of
that righteous person. Thus will the Master also judge us: He places fellow servants with
fellow-servants, nor does he give sentence according to his own judgment, in order that no
one may begin to say again, as that servant said, who was entrusted with the talent, and who
instead of a talent brought the accusation. “Thou art an austere man.”609 For he ought to
mourn, because he did not double the talent, but rendered his sin the more grievous, by
adding to his own idleness, his accusation against the Master. For what saith he? “I knew
thee that thou art an austere man.” O miserable, and wretched, ungrateful and lazy man!
Thou oughtest to have accused thine own idleness, and to have taken away somewhat from
thy former sin. But thou in bringing an account against the master hast doubled thy sin instead
of doubling thy talent.</p>
<p>3. On this account God places together servants and servants in order that the one set
may judge the other, and that some being judged by the others may not be able for the future
to accuse the master. On this account, he saith “The Son of Man cometh in the glory of his
Father.”610 See the equality of the glory: he does not say in glory like to the glory of the
Father, but in the glory of the Father, and will gather together all the nations. Terrible is the
tribunal: terrible to the sinful, and the accountable. Since to those who are conscious to
themselves of good works, it is desirable and mild. “And he will place the sheep on his right
hand, and the kids on his left.”611 Both these and those are men. For what reason then are
those indeed sheep but these kids? Not that thou mayest learn a difference in their nature,
but the difference in their purpose. But for what reason are they who did not show compassion
kids? Because that animal is unfruitful and is not able to contribute services, either by
its milk, or by progeny, or by its hair, to those who possess it, being on all sides destitute of
such a contribution as this, on account of the immaturity of its age. On this account he has
called those who bear no fruit, by comparison, kids, but those on the right hand sheep. For
from these the offering is great, both of their natural wool, their progeny, and their milk.
What then does he say to them? “Ye saw me hungering and ye fed me, naked and ye clothed
me, a stranger and ye took me in.” Again to those he says the contrary. And yet both these
and those were alike men, both these and those received the same promises, the same rewards
were assigned to both on doing right. The same person came both to these and to those,
with the same nakedness: and to these and to those with the same hunger, and in the same
way and a stranger. All things were alike to those and to these.</p>

<pb n="269"/>
<p>How then was the end not the same? Because the purpose did not permit it. For this
alone made the difference. On this account the one set went to Gehenna, but the other to
the Kingdom. But if the Devil were the cause to them of their sins, these would not be
destined to be chastened, when another sinned and drove them on. Dost thou see here both
those who sin, and those who do good works? Dost thou see how on seeing their fellowservants
they were silenced? Come and let us bring our discourse to another example for
thy benefit. There were ten virgins he says.612 Here again there are purposes which are upright,
and purposes which are sinful, in order thou mayest see side by side, both the sins of
the one and the good works of the others. For the comparison makes these things the
plainer. And these and those were virgins; and these were five, and also those. All awaited
the bridegroom. How then did some enter in, and others did not enter in? Because some
indeed were churlish, and others were gentle and loving. Dost thou see again that the purpose
determined the nature of the end, not the Devil? Dost thou see that the judgments were
parallel, and that the verdict given proceeds from those who are like each other? Fellowservants
will judge fellow-servants. Dost thou wish that I should shew thee a comparison
arising from contrasts? for there is one also from contrasts so that the condemnation may
become the greater. “The men of Nineveh” he saith “shall rise up, and shall condemn this
generation.”613 The judged are no longer alike, for the one are barbarians, the others are
Jews. The one enjoyed prophetic teaching, the others were never partakers of a divine instruction.
And this is not the only difference, but the fact that in that case a servant went to
them, in this the master; and that man came and proclaimed an overthrow; but this man
declared the glad tidings of a kingdom of heaven. Which of these was it the more likely,
would believe? The barbarians, and ignorant, and they who had never partaken of divine
teaching, or they who had from their earliest age been trained in prophetic books? To every
one, it is plain, that the Jews would be more likely to believe. But the contrary took place.
And these disbelieved the Master when he preached a kingdom of heaven, but those believed
their fellow-servant when he threatened an overthrow: in order that their goodness, and
these men’s folly might be manifested to a greater degree. Is there a Demon? a Devil? chance?
or Fate? has not each become the cause to himself both of evil, and of virtue? For if they
themselves were not to be liable to account, he would not have said that they shall judge
this generation. Nor would he have said that the Queen of the South would condemn the
Jews. For then indeed not only will one people condemn another people, but one man will
often judge a whole people, when they who, it is allowed, might readily have been deceived,
are found to remain undeceived, and they who ought in every way to have the advantage,
turn out to be worsted. On this account, we made mention of Adam and of Job, for there
<note type="footnote">612 Matt. xxv.</note>
<note type="footnote">613 Matt. xii. 41.</note>

<pb n="270"/>
is necessity to revert to that subject, so as to put the finish to our discourse. He attacked
Adam indeed by means of mere words, but Job by means of deeds. For the one he denuded
of all his wealth, and deprived of his children. But from this man he took not away anything,
great or little of his possessions. But let us rather examine the very words and the method
of the plot. “The serpent came” saith he “and said to the woman, What is it that God hath
said, ye shall not eat of every tree which is in the garden?”614 Here it is a serpent; there a
woman, in the case of Job: mean while great is the difference between the counsellors. The
one615 is a servant, the other616 a partner of the man’s life. She is a helpmate, but the other
is under subjection. Dost thou see how unpardonable this is? Eve indeed, the servant in
subjection deceived: but him617 not even his partner, and helpmate could overthrow. But
let us see what he saith. “What is this that God hath said, thou shalt not eat of every tree?”
Assuredly indeed God did not say this but the opposite. See the villany of the Devil. He said
that which was not spoken, in order that he might learn what was spoken. What then did
the woman? She ought to have silenced him, she ought not to have exchanged a word with
him. In foolishness she declared the judgment of the Master. Thereby she afforded the
Devil a powerful handle.</p>
<p>4. See what an evil it is to commit ourselves rashly to our enemies, and to conspirators
against us. On this account Christ used to say, “Give not holy things to the dogs, neither
cast ye your pearls before the swine, lest they turn and rend you.”618 And this happened in
the case of Eve. She gave the holy things to the dog, to the swine. He trod under foot the
words: and turned and rent the woman. And see how he works evil. “Ye shall not die the
death” saith he.619</p>
<p>Give me your attention on this point, that the woman was able to understand the deceit.
For he immediately announced his enmity, and his warfare against God, he immediately
contradicted Him. Let it be so. Before this thou declaredst the judgment to one who wished
to learn it. After this why didst thou follow one who said the opposite? God said “ye shall
die the death.” The Devil made answer to this and said “ye shall not die the death.” What
could be clearer than this warfare? From what other quarter ought one to learn the enemy
and the foe, than from his answer returned to God? She ought then immediately to have
fled from the bait, she ought to have started back from the snare. “Ye shall not die the death,”
saith he “for God knoweth, that on the day on which ye eat, your eyes shall be opened, and

<pb n="271"/>
ye shall be as Gods. In hope of a greater promise she cast away the goods in her hand. He
promised that he would make them Gods, and cast them down into the tyranny of death.
Whence then O woman didst thou believe the Devil? What good didst thou discern? Was
not the trustworthiness of the lawgiver sufficient to prove that the one was God, both creator
and framer of the world, and the other the Devil and an enemy? And I do not say the Devil.
Thou thoughtest that he was a mere serpent. Ought a serpent to claim such equality that
thou shouldest tell him the Master’s judgment? Thou seest that it was possible to perceive
the deceit, but she would not, and yet God gave many proofs of his own beneficence and
shewed forth his care of his works. For he formed man, who had not existed before; and
breathed a soul into him, and made him according to his image, making him ruler of all
things upon the earth, and granted him a helpmate, planted Paradise, and having committed
to him the use of the rest of the trees, refused him the taste of one only: and this very prohibition
he made for man’s advantage. But the Devil manifested no good things by his deed,
whether little, or great: but exciting the woman with mere words and puffing her up with
vain hopes, thus he deceived her. But nevertheless she considered the Devil to be more
worthy of credit than God, although God shewed forth his good will by his works. The woman
believed in one who professed mere words, and nothing else. Dost thou see how, from folly
alone and sloth, and not from force, the deceit happened? and in order that thou mayest
learn it more clearly hear how the scripture accuses the woman: For it does not say, being
deceived, but “seeing the tree that it was fair, she ate.” So that the blame belongs to her uncontrolled
vision, not to the deceit alone which comes from the Devil. For she was defeated
by yielding to her own desire, not by the wickedness. of the Demon. On this account she
did not have the benefit of pardon, but though she said, “the serpent deceived me,” she paid
the uttermost penalty. For it was in her power not to have fallen. And in order that thou
mayest understand this more clearly, come, let us conduct our discourse to the case of Job;
from the defeated to the vanquisher, from the conquered to the conqueror. For this man
will give us greater zeal, so that we may raise our hands against the Devil. There he who
deceived and conquered was a serpent; here the tempter was a woman, and she did not
prevail: and yet at least she was far more persuasive than he. For to Job after the destruction
of his wealth, after the loss of his children, after being stripped bare of all his goods, her
wiles were added. But in the other case there was nothing of this kind. Adam did not suffer
the destruction of his children, nor did he lose his wealth: he did not sit upon a dunghill,
but inhabited a Paradise of luxury and enjoyed all manner of fruits, and fountains and rivers,
and every other kind of security. Nowhere was there labour or pain, or despair and cares,
or reproaches, and insults, or the countless ills which assailed Job: but nevertheless, when
nothing of this kind existed, he fell and was overthrown. Is it not evident that it was on account
of sloth? Even so therefore as the other, when all these things beset him, and weighed

<pb n="272"/>
upon him, stood nobly and did not fall, is it not evident that his steadfastness was owing to
his vigilance of soul?</p>
<p>5. On both sides, beloved, reap the utmost gain, and avoid the imitation of Adam
knowing how many ills are begotten of indolence: and imitate the piety of Job, learning how
many glorious things spring from earnestness. Consider him, the conqueror throughout,
and thou shalt have much consolation in all pain and peril. For as it were in the common
theatre of the world that blessed and noble man stands forth, and by means of the sufferings
which happened to him discourses to all to bear all things which befal them nobly, and
never give in to the troubles which come upon them. For verily, there is no human suffering
which cannot receive consolation from thence. For the sufferings which are scattered over
the whole world, these came together, and bore down upon one body, even his. What pardon
then shall there be for him who is unable to bear with thankfulness his share of the troubles
which are brought upon him? Since he appears not bearing a part only, but the entire ills
of all men, and in order that thou mayest not condemn the extravagance of my words, come,
and let us take in hand severally the ills that came upon him, and bring forward this fulfilment
of them. And if thou wishest, let us first bring forward that which seems to be the most unendurable
of all, I mean poverty, and the pain which arises from it. For everywhere all men
bewail this. What was poorer then than Job, who was poorer than the outcasts at the baths,
and those who sleep in the ashes of the furnace, poorer in fact than all men? For these indeed
have one ragged garment, but he sat naked, and had only the garment which nature supplies,
the clothing of the flesh, and this the Devil destroyed on all sides, with a distressing kind of
decay. Again these poor folk are at least under the roof of the porches at the baths, and are
covered with a shelter. But he continued always to pass his nights in the open air, not having
even the consolation of a bare roof. And, what is still greater, the fact that these are conscious
of many terrible evils within themselves, but he was conscious of nothing against himself.
For this is to be noticed in each of the things which happened to him, a thing which caused
him greater pain, and produced more perplexity; the ignorance of the reason of what took
place. These persons then, as I said, would have many things with which to reproach
themselves. And this contributes no little to consolation in calamity; to be conscious in
oneself of being punished justly. But he was deprived of this consolation, and while exhibiting
a conversation full of virtue, endured the fate of those who had dared to do extreme
wickedness. And these folk who are with us, are poor from the outset, and from the beginning
are versed in calamity. But he endured calamity in which he was unversed, experiencing the
immense change from wealth. As then the knowledge of the cause of what takes place, is
the greatest consolation; so it is not less than this, to have been versed in poverty from the
beginning, and so to continue in it. Of both these consolations that man was deprived, and
not even then, did he fall away. Dost thou see him indeed come to extreme poverty, even
in comparison with which it is impossible to find a fellow? For what could be poorer than

<pb n="273"/>
the naked who has not even a roof over him? Yea rather not even was it in his power to enjoy
the bare ground, but he sat upon the dunghill. Therefore whenever thou seest thyself come
to poverty, consider the suffering of the just one, and straightway thou shalt rise up, and
shake off every thought of despondency. This one calamity therefore seems to men to be
the groundwork of all sufferings together. And the second after it, yea rather before it, is
the affliction of the body. Who then was even so disabled? Who endured such disease? Who
received or saw any one else receive so great an affliction? No one. Little by little his body
was wasted, and a stream of worms on every side issued from his limbs, the running was
constant, and the evil smell which surrounded him was strong, and the body being destroyed
little by little, and decaying with such putrefaction, used to make food distasteful and hunger
was to him strange and unusual. For not even was he able to enjoy the nourishment which
was given to him. For saith he “I see my food to be loathsome.”620 Whenever then thou
fallest into weakness, O man, remember that body and that saintly flesh. For it was saintly
and pure, even when it had so many wounds. And if any one belong to the army, and then
unjustly and without any reasonable pretext, be hanged upon the pillory, and has his sides
rasped to pieces, let him not think the matter to be a reproach, nor let him give way to the
pain when he thinks upon this saint. But this man, says one, has much comfort and consolation
in knowing that God was bringing these sufferings upon him. This indeed especially
troubled and disturbed him, to think that the just God who had in every way been served
by him, was at war with him. And he was not able to find any reasonable pretext for what
took place, since, when at least he afterwards learned the cause, see what piety he shewed,
for when God said to him “Dost thou think that I have had dealings with thee in order that
thou mightest appear righteous?”621 conscious-stricken he says “I will lay my hand upon
my mouth, once have I spoken but to a second word I will not proceed,”622 and again “as
far as the hearing of the ear I have heard thee before, but now mine eye hath seen thee,
wherefore I have held myself to be vile, and am wasted away, and I consider myself to be
earth and ashes.”623</p>
<p>6. But if thou thinkest that this is sufficient for consolation, thou wilt thyself also be able
to experience this comfort. And even if thou dost not suffer any of these misfortunes at the
hands of God but owing to the insolence of men; and yet givest thanks and dost not blaspheme
him who is able to prevent them indeed, but who permits them for the sake of testing
thee: just as they who suffer at the hands of God are crowned, so also thou shalt obtain the
same reward, because thou hast borne nobly the calamities which were brought upon thee

from men, and didst give thanks to him who was able indeed to hinder them, but not willing.</p>
<p>Behold then! thou hast seen poverty and disease, and both in the extremest degree
brought upon this just man. Dost thou wish that I should shew thee the warfare at nature’s
hands, in such excessive degree waged then against this noble man? He lost ten children,
the ten at one fell swoop, the ten in the very bloom of youth, ten who displayed much virtue,
and that not by the common law of nature, but by a violent and pitiable death. Who could
be able to recount so great a calamity? No one. Whenever therefore thou losest son and
daughter together, have recourse to this just man, and thou shalt find altogether much
comfort for thyself. Were these then the only misfortunes which happened to him? The
desertion and treachery of his friends, and the gibes, and raillery, and the mockery and derision,
and the tearing in pieces by all, was something intolerable. For the character of
calamities is not of such a kind, that they who reproach us about our calamities are wont to
vex our soul. Not only was there no one to soothe him but many even on many sides beset
him with taunts. And thou seest him lamenting this bitterly, and saying “but even you too
fell upon me.”624 And he calls them pitiless, and says “My neighbours have rejected me,
and my servants spake against me, and I called the sons of my concubines, and they turned
away from me.”625 “And others” saith he “sport upon me, and I became the common talk
of all.626 And my very raiment” saith he “abhorred me.”627 These things at least are unbearable
to hear, still more to endure in their reality, extreme poverty, and intolerable disease
new and strange, the loss of children so many and so good, and in such a manner, reproaches
and gibes, and insults from men. Some indeed mocked and some reproached and others
despised; not only enemies, but even friends; not only friends, but even servants, and they
not only mock and reproach, but even abhorred him, and this not for two or three, or ten
days, but for many months; and (a circumstance which happened in that man’s case alone)
not even had he comfort by night, but the delusions of terrors by night were a greater aggravation
of his misfortunes by day. For that he endured more grievous things in his sleep,
hear what he says “why dost thou frighten me in sleep, and terrify me in visions?”628 What
man of iron, what heart of steel could have endured so many misfortunes? For if each of
these was unbearable in itself, consider what a tumult their simultaneous approach excited.
But nevertheless he bore all these, and in all that happened to him he sinned not, nor was
there guile in his lips.</p>

<p>7. Let the sufferings of that man then be the medicines for our ills, and his grievous
surging sea the harbour of our sufferings, and in each of the accidents which befal us, let us
consider this saint, and seeing one person exhausting the misfortunes of the universe, we
shall conduct ourselves bravely in those which fall to our share, and as to some affectionate
mother, stretching forth her hands on all sides, and receiving and reviving her terrified
children, so let us always flee to this book, and even if the pitiable troubles of all men assail
us, let us take sufficient comfort for all and so depart. And if thou sayest, he was Job, and
for this reason bore all this, but I am not like him; thou suppliest me with a greater accusation
against thyself and fresh praise of him. For it is more likely that thou shouldest be able to
bear all this than he. Why pray? Because he indeed was before the day of grace and of the
law, when there was not much strictness of life, when the grace of the Spirit was not so great,
when sin was hard to fight against, when the curse prevailed and when death was terrible.
But now our wrestlings have become easier, all these things being removed after the coming
of Christ; so that we have no excuse, when we are unable to reach the same standard as he,
after so long a time, and such advantage, and so many gifts given to us by God. Considering
therefore all these things, that misfortunes were greater for him, and that when the conflict
was more grievous, then he stripped for the contest; let us bear all that comes upon us nobly,
and with much thankfulness, in order that we may be able to obtain the same crown as he,
by the grace and lovingkindness of Jesus Christ our Lord, with whom be glory to the Father
together with the Holy Spirit, now and always and for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>ST. CHRYSOSTOM:
HOMILY
ON THE PASSAGE (MATT. XXVI. 19), “FATHER IF IT BE
POSSIBLE LET THIS CUP PASS FROM ME,” ETC., AND AGAINST
MARCIONISTS AND MANICHÆANS.</p>
<p>TRANSLATED BY
REV. W. R. W. STEPHENS, M.A.,
PREBENDARY OF CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL, AND RECTOR OF WOOLBEDING,

<head>AGAINST MARCIONISTS AND MANICHÆANS.</head>
<p>On the passage “Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me, nevertheless not as I will but
as thou wilt:” and against Marcionists and Manichæans: also, that we ought not to rush
into danger, but to prefer the will of God before every other will.</p>
<p>1. I lately inflicted a severe stroke upon those who are grasping and wish to overreach
others;629 I did this not in order to wound them but in order to correct them; not because
I hate the men, but because I detest their wickedness. For so the physician also lances the
abscess, not as making an attack upon the suffering body, but as a means of contending with
the disorder and the wound. Well to-day let us grant them a little respite, that they may recover
from their distress, and not recoil from the remedy by being perpetually afflicted.
Physicians also act thus; after the use of the knife they apply plasters and drugs, and let a
few days pass whilst they devise things to allay the pain. Following their example let me
today, devising means for them to derive benefit from my discourse, start a question concerning
doctrine, directing my speech to the words which have been read. For I imagine
that many feel perplexed as to the reason why these words were uttered by Christ: and it is
probable also that any heretics who are present may pounce upon the words, and thereby
upset many of the more simple-minded brethren.</p>
<p>In order then to build a wall against their attack and to relieve those who are in perplexity
from bewilderment and confusion, let us take in hand the words which have been cited, and
dwell upon the passage, and dive into the depths of its meanings. For reading does not suffice
unless knowledge also be added to it. Even as the eunuch of Candace read, but until one
came who instructed him in the meaning of what he was reading he derived no great benefit
from it. In order therefore that you may not be in the same condition attend to what is said,
exert your understanding, let me have your mind disengaged from other thoughts, let your
eye be quick-sighted, your intention earnest: let your soul be set free from worldly cares,
that we may not sow our words upon the thorns, or upon the rock, or by the way side, but
that we may till a deep and rich field, and so reap an abundant harvest. For if you thus attend
to what is said you will render my labour lighter and facilitate the discovery of that which
you are seeking.</p>
<p>What then is the meaning of the passage which has been read “Father if it be possible
let this cup pass from me?” What does the saying mean? For we ought to unlock the passage
by first giving a clear interpretation of the words. What then does the saying mean? “Father
if it be possible take away the cross.” How sayest thou? is he ignorant whether this be possible
<note type="footnote">629 This was such a very common topic with Chrysostom that it affords no clue to the date of the Homily.</note>

<pb n="278"/>
or impossible? Who would venture to say this? Yet the words are those of one who is ignorant:
for the addition of the word “if,” is indicative of doubt: but as I said we must not attend to
the words merely, but turn our attention to the sense, and learn the aim of the speaker, and
the cause and the occasion, and by putting all these things together turn out the hidden
meaning. The unspeakable Wisdom then, who knoweth the Father even as the Father
knoweth the Son, how should he have been ignorant of this? For this knowledge concerning
His passion was not greater than the knowledge concerning His essential nature, which He
alone accurately knew. “For as the Father knoweth me” He says “even so know I the Father.”
630 And why do I speak of the only begotten Son of God? For even the prophets appear
not to have been ignorant of this fact, but to have known it clearly, and to have declared
beforehand with much assurance that so it must come to pass, and would certainly be.</p>
<p>Hear at least how variously all announce the cross. First of all the patriarch Jacob: for
directing his discourse to Him he says “Out of a tender shoot didst thou spring up:”631 by
the word shoot signifying the Virgin and the undefiled nature of Mary. Then indicating the
cross he said “Thou didst lie down and slumber as a lion, and as a lion’s whelp; who shall
raise him up?”632 Here he called death a slumbering and a sleep, and with death he combined
the resurrection when he said “who shall raise him up?” No one indeed save he himself—
wherefore also Christ said “I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take
it again,”633 and again “Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.”634 And what
is meant by the words “thou didst lie down and slumber as a lion?” For as the lion is terrible
not only when he is awake but even when he is sleeping, so Christ also not only before the
cross but also on the cross itself and in the very moment of death was terrible, and wrought
at that time great miracles, turning back the light of the sun, cleaving the rocks, shaking the
earth, rending the veil, alarming the wife of Pilate, convicting Judas of sin, for then he said
“I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood;”635 and the wife of Pilate declared
“Have nothing to do with that just man, for I have suffered many things in a dream because
of Him.”636 The darkness took possession of the earth, and night appeared at midday, then
death was brought to nought, and his tyranny was destroyed: many bodies at least of the
saints which slept arose. These things the patriarch declaring beforehand, and demonstrating
that, even when crucified, Christ would be terrible, said “thou didst lie down and slumber

as a lion.” He did not say thou shalt slumber but thou didst slumber, because it would certainly
come to pass. For it is the custom of the prophets in many places to predict things to
come as if they were already past. For just as it is impossible that things which have happened
should not have happened, so is it impossible that this should not happen, although it be
future. On this account they predict things to come under the semblance of past time, indicating
by this means the impossibility of their failure, the certainty of their coming to pass.
So also spake David, signifying the cross; “They pierced my hands and my feet.”637 He did
not say they “shall pierce” but “they pierced” “they counted all my bones.”638 And not only
does he say this, but he also describes the things which were done by the soldiers. “They
parted my garments among themselves, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.”639 And
not only this but he also relates they gave Him gall to eat, and vinegar to drink. For he says
“they gave me gall for my food, and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.”640 And
again another one says that they smote him with a spear, for “they shall look on Him whom
they pierced.”641 Esaias again in another fashion predicting the cross said “He was led as a
sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, so openeth he not his
mouth.” “In his humiliation his judgment was taken away.”642</p>
<p>2. Now observe I pray how each one of these writers speaks as if concerning things
already past, signifying by the use of this tense the absolute inevitable certainty of the event.
So also David, describing this tribunal, said, “Why did the heathen rage and the people
imagine vain things? The Kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together
against the Lord and against his Christ.”643 And not only does he mention the trial, and the
cross, and the incidents on the cross, but also him who betrayed him, declaring that he was
his familiar companion and guest. “For,” he saith, “he that eateth bread with me did magnify
his heel against me.”644 Thus also does he foretell the voice which Christ was to utter on
the cross saying “My God, My God why hast thou forsaken me?”645 and the burial also does
he describe: “They laid me in the lowest pit, in dark places, and in the shadow of death.”646
And the resurrection: “thou shalt not leave my soul in hell, neither shalt thou suffer thy

Holy One to see corruption;”647 and the ascension: “God has gone up with a merry noise,
the Lord with the sound of the trump.”648 And the session on the right hand: “The Lord
said to my Lord sit thou on my right hand until I make thy foes thy footstool.”649 But Esaias
also declares the cause; saying, “for the transgressions of my people is He brought to
death,”650 and because all have strayed like sheep, therefore is he sacrificed.”651 Then also
he adds mention of the result, saying “by his stripes we have all been healed:”652 and “he
hath borne the sins of many.”653 The prophets then knew the cross, and the cause of the
cross and that which was effected by it, and the burial and the resurrection, and the ascension,
and the betrayal, and the trial, and described them all with accuracy: and is He who sent
them and commanded them to speak these things ignorant of them Himself? What reasonable
man would say that? Seest thou that we must not attend merely to the words? For this is not
the only perplexing passage, but what follows is more perplexing. For what does He say?
“Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me.” Here he will be found to speak not only
as if ignorant, but as if deprecating the cross: For this is what He says. “If it be permissible
let me not be subjected to crucifixion and death.” And yet when Peter, the leader of the
apostles, said this to Him, “Be it far from thee Lord, this shall not happen unto Thee,” He
rebuked him so severely as to say; “get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence unto me,
for thou savourest not the things which be of God, but those which be of men:”654 although
a short time before he had pronounced him blessed. But to escape crucifixion seemed to
Him so monstrous a thing, that him who had received the revelation from the Father, him
whom He had pronounced blessed, him who had received the keys of Heaven, He called
Satan, and an offence, and accused him of not savouring the things which be of God because
he said to Him, “Be it far from thee Lord, this shall never be unto Thee”—namely crucifixion.
He then who thus vituperated the disciple, and poured such an invective upon him as actually
to call him Satan (after having bestowed such great praise on him), because he said “avoid
crucifixion,” how could He desire not to be crucified? and how after these things when
drawing the picture of the good shepherd could He declare this to be the special proof of
his virtue, that he should be sacrificed for the sake of the sheep, thus saying, “I am the good
shepherd; the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep?”655 Nor did He even stop

there, but also added, “but he that is an hireling and not the shepherd seeth the wolf coming
and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth.”656 If then it is the sign of the good shepherd to sacrifice
himself, and of the hireling to be unwilling to undergo this, how can He who calls Himself
the good shepherd beseech that he may not be sacrificed? And how could He say “I lay down
my life of myself”? For if thou layest down thy life of thyself, how canst thou beseech another
that thou mayest not lay it down? And how is it that Paul marvels at Him on account of this
declaration, saying “Who being in the form of God counted it not a prize to be on an
equality with God, but emptied Himself taking the form of a servant, being made in the
likeness of men, and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself, becoming
obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross.”657 And He Himself again speaks in
this wise, “For this cause doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life that I may take
it again.”658 For if He does not desire to lay it down, but deprecates the act, and beseeches
the Father, how is it that He is loved on this account? For love is of those who are like minded.
And how does Paul say again “Love one another even as Christ also loved us and gave
Himself for us?”659 And Christ Himself when He was about to be crucified said “Father,
the hour has come: glorify thy Son,”660 speaking of the cross as glory: and how then does
He deprecate it here when He urges it there? For that the cross is glory listen to what the
evangelist says “the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.”661
Now the hearing of this expression is “grace was not yet given because the enmity towards
men was not yet destroyed by reason that the cross had not yet done its work.” For the cross
destroyed the enmity of God towards man, brought about the reconciliation, made the earth
Heaven, associated men with angels, pulled down the citadel of death, unstrung the force
of the devil, extinguished the power of sin, delivered the world from error, brought back
the truth, expelled the Demons, destroyed temples, overturned altars, suppressed the sacrificial
offering, implanted virtue, founded the Churches. The cross is the will of the Father,
the glory of the Son, the rejoicing of the Spirit, the boast of Paul, “for,” he says, “God forbid
that I should boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.”662 The cross is that which is
brighter than the sun, more brilliant than the sunbeam: for when the sun is darkened then
the cross shines brightly: and the sun is darkened not because it is extinguished, but because
it is overpowered by the brilliancy of the cross. The cross has broken our bond, it has made

the prison of death ineffectual, it is the demonstration of the love of God. “For God so loved
the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him should
not perish.”663 And again Paul says “If being enemies we were reconciled to God by the
death of His Son.”664 The cross is the impregnable wall, the invulnerable shield, the safeguard
of the rich, the resource of the poor, the defence of those who are exposed to snares, the
armour of those who are attacked, the means of suppressing passion, and of acquiring virtue,
the wonderful and marvellous sign. “For this generation seeketh after a sign: and no sign
shall be given it save the sign of Jonas;”665 and again Paul says, “for the Jews ask for a sign
and the Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified.”666 The cross opened Paradise,
it brought in the robber, it conducted into the kingdom of Heaven the race of man which
was about to perish, and was not worthy even of earth. So great are the benefits which have
sprung and do spring from the cross, and yet doth He not desire to be crucified I ask? Who
would venture to say this? And if He did not desire it who compelled Him, who forced Him
to it? and why did He send prophets beforehand announcing that He would be crucified, if
He was not to be, and did not wish to undergo it? And for what reason does He call the cross
a cup, if He did not desire to be crucified? For that is the word of one who signifies the desire
which he has concerning the act. For as the cup is sweet to those who are thirsty so also was
crucifixion to Him: wherefore also He said “With desire have I desired to eat this Passover
with you,”667 and this He meant not absolutely, but relatively, because after that evening
the cross was awaiting Him.</p>
<p>3. He then who calls the thing glory, and rebukes the disciple because he was trying to
hinder Him, and proves that what constitutes the good shepherd is his sacrificing himself
on behalf of the sheep, and declares that he earnestly longs for this thing, and willingly goes
to meet it, how is it that He beseeches it may not come to pass? And if He did not wish it
what difficulty was there in hindering those who came for that purpose? But in fact you
behold Him hastening towards the deed. At least when they came upon Him He said “Whom
seek ye?” and they replied “Jesus.” Then He saith to them “Lo! I am He: and they went
backward and fell to the ground.”668 Thus having first crippled them and proved that He
was able to escape their hands, He then surrendered Himself, that thou mightest learn that
not by compulsion or force, or the tyrannical power of those who attacked Him, did He
unwillingly submit to this, but willingly with purpose and desire, preparing for it a long

time before. Therefore also were prophets sent beforehand, and patriarchs foretold the
events, and by means of words and deeds the cross was prefigured. For the sacrifice of Isaac
also signified the cross to us: wherefore also Christ said “Abraham your father rejoiced to
see my glory and he saw it and was glad.”669 The patriarch then was glad beholding the
image of the cross, and does He Himself deprecate it? Thus Moses also prevailed over Amalek
when he displayed the figure of the cross: and one may observe countless things happening
in the Old Testament descriptive by anticipation of the cross. For what reason then was this
the case if He who was to be crucified did not wish it to come to pass? And the sentence
which follows this is yet more perplexing. For having said “Let this cup pass from me He
added “nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt.”670 For herein as far as the actual expression
is concerned we find two wills opposed to one another: if at least the Father desires
Him to be crucified, but He Himself does not desire it. And yet we everywhere behold Him
desiring and purposing the same things as the Father. For when He says “grant to them, as
I and Thou are one that they also may be one in us,”671 it is equivalent to saying that the
purpose of the Father and of the Son is one. And when He says “The words which I speak
I speak not myself, but the Father which dwelleth in me, He doeth these works,”672 He indicates
the same thing. And when He says “I have not come of myself”673 and “I can of my
own self do nothing”674 he does not say this as signifying that He has been deprived of authority,
either to speak or to act (away with the thought!), but as desiring to prove the concord
of his purpose, both in words and deeds, and in every kind of transaction, to be one and the
same with the Father, as I have already frequently demonstrated. For the expression “I speak
not of myself” is not an abrogation of authority but a demonstration of agreement. How
then does He say here “Nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt”? Perhaps I have excited
a great conflict in your mind, but be on the alert: for although many words have been uttered
I know well that your zeal is still fresh: for the discourse is now hastening on to the solution.
Why then has this form of speech been employed? Attend carefully, The doctrine of the
incarnation was very hard to receive. For the exceeding measure of His lovingkindness and
the magnitude of His condescension were full of awe, and needed much preparation to be
accepted. For consider what a great thing it was to hear and to learn that God the ineffable,
the incorruptible, the unintelligible, the invisible, the incomprehensible, in whose hand are
the ends of the earth,675 who looketh upon the earth, and causeth it to tremble, who toucheth

the mountains, and maketh them smoke,676 the weight of whose condescension not even
the Cherubim were able to bear but veiled their faces by the shelter of their wings, that this
God who surpasses all understanding, and baffles all calculation, having passed by angels,
archangels, and all the spiritual powers above, deigned to become man, and to take flesh
formed of earth and clay, and enter the womb of a virgin, and be borne there the space of
nine months, and be nourished with milk, and suffer all things to which man is liable.
Inasmuch then as that which was to happen was so strange as to be disbelieved by many
even when it had taken place, He first of all sends prophets beforehand, announcing this
very fact. For instance the patriarch predicted it saying “Thou didst spring from a tender
shoot my son: thou didst lie down and slumber as a lion;”677 and Esaias saying “Behold the
Virgin shall conceive and bear a son and they shall call His name Emmanuel;”678 and elsewhere
again “We beheld Him as a young child, as a root in a dry ground;”679 and by the dry
ground he means the virgin’s womb. And again “unto us a child is born, unto us a son is
given,”680 and again “there shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall
spring out of his root.”681 And Baruch in the book of Jeremiah says “this is our God: no
other shall be reckoned by the side of Him: He found out every path of knowledge and gave
it to Jacob His servant, and Israel his beloved. After these things also He appeared upon the
earth, and held converse with men.”682 And David signifying His incarnate presence said
“He shall come down like the rain into a fleece of wool, and like the drop which distills upon
the earth”683 because He noiselessly and gently entered into the Virgin’s womb.</p>
<p>4. But these proofs alone did not suffice, but even when He had come, lest what had
taken place should be deemed an illusion, He warranted the fact not only by the sight but
by duration of time and by passing through all the phases incident to man. For He did not
enter once for all into a man matured and completely developed, but into a virgin’s womb,
so as to undergo the process of gestation and birth and suckling and growth, and by the
length of the time and the variety of the stages of growth to give assurance of what had come
to pass. And not even here were the proofs concluded, but even when bearing about the
body of flesh He suffered it to experience the infirmities of human nature and to be hungry,
and thirsty, and to sleep and feel fatigue; finally also when He came to the cross He suffered

it to undergo the pains of the flesh. For this reason also streams of sweat flowed down from
it and an angel was discovered strengthening it, and He was sad and down-cast: for before
He uttered these words He said “my soul is troubled, and exceeding sorrowful ever unto
death.”684 If then after all these things have taken place the wicked mouth of the devil
speaking through Marcion of Pontus, and Valentinus, and Manichæus of Persia and many
more heretics, has attempted to overthrow the doctrine of the Incarnation and has vented
a diabolical utterance declaring that He did not become flesh, nor was clothed with it, but
that this was mere fancy, and illusion, a piece of acting and pretence, although the sufferings,
the death, the burial, the thirst, cry aloud against this teaching; supposing that none of these
things had happened would not the devil have sown these wicked doctrines of impiousness
much more widely? For this reason, just as He hungered, as He slept, as He felt fatigue, as
He ate and drank, so also did He deprecate death, thereby manifesting his humanity, and
that infirmity of human nature which does not submit without pain to be torn from this
present life. For had He not uttered any of these things, it might have been said that if He
were a man He ought to have experienced human feelings. And what are these? in the case
of one about to be crucified, fear and agony, and pain in being torn from present life: for a
sense of the charm which surrounds present things is implanted in human nature: on this
account wishing to prove the reality of the fleshly clothing, and to give assurance of the incarnation
He manifests the actual feelings of man with full demonstration.</p>
<p>This is one consideration, but there is another no less important. And what is this?
Christ having come to earth wished to instruct men in all virtue: now the instructor teaches
not only by word, but also by deed: for this is the teacher’s best method of teaching. A pilot
for instance when he makes the apprentice sit by his side shows him how he handles the
rudder, but he also joins speech to action, and does not depend upon words alone or example
alone: in like manner also an architect when he has placed by his side the man who is intended
to learn from him how a wall is constructed, shows him the way by means of action as well
as by means of oral teaching; so also with the weaver, and embroiderer, and gold refiner,
and coppersmith;—and every kind of art has teachers who instruct both orally and practically.
Inasmuch then as Christ Himself came to instruct us in all virtue, He both tells us what
ought to be done, and does it. “For,” he says, “he who does and teaches the same shall be
called great in the kingdom of heaven.”685 Now observe; He commanded men to be lowlyminded,
and meek, and He taught this by His words: but see how He also teaches it by His
deeds. For having said “Blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are the meek,”686 He shows
how these virtues ought to be practised. How then did He teach them? He took a towel and

<pb n="286"/>
girded Himself and washed the disciples’ feet.687 What can match this lowliness of mind?
for He teaches this virtue no longer by His words only but also by His deeds. Again He
teaches meekness and forbearance by His acts. How so? He was struck on the face by the
servant of the high priest, and said “If I have spoken evil bear witness of the evil: but if well
why smitest thou me?”688 He commanded men to pray for their enemies: this also again
He teaches by means of His acts: for when He had ascended the cross He said “Father forgive
them for they know not what they do.”689 As therefore He commanded men to pray so does
He Himself pray, instructing thee to do so by his own unflagging utterances of prayer. Again
He commanded us to do good to those who hate us, and to deal fairly with those who treat
us despitefully:690 and this He did by his own acts: for he cast devils out of the Jews, who
said that He Himself was possessed by a devil, He bestowed benefits on His persecutors, He
fed those who were forming designs against Him, He conducted into His kingdom those
who were desiring to crucify Him. Again He said to His disciples “Get you no gold nor silver
neither brass in your purses,”691 thus training them for poverty: and this also He taught by
His example, thus saying, “Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son
of man hath not where to lay His head.”692 And He had neither table nor dwelling nor
anything else of that kind: not because He was at a loss to obtain them, but because He was
instructing men to go in that path. After the same manner then he taught them also to pray.
They said to Him “Teach us to pray.”693 Therefore also He prays, in order that they may
learn to pray. But it was necessary for them not merely to learn to pray but also how they
ought to pray: for this reason He delivered to them a prayer in this form: “Our Father which
art in Heaven hallowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come: Thy will be done, as in Heaven,
so on earth. Give us this day our daily bread: and forgive us our debts as we also forgive our
debtors: and lead us not into temptation:”694 that is into danger, into snares. Since then He
commanded them to pray “lead us not into temptation,” He instructs them in this very
precept by putting it in practice Himself, saying “Father if it be possible, let this cup pass
away from me,” thus teaching all the saints not to plunge into dangers, not to fling themselves
into them but to wait for their approach, and to exhibit all possible courage, only not to
rush forwards themselves, or to be the first to advance against terrors. Why so, pray? both

to teach us lowliness of mind, and also to deliver us from the charge of vainglory. On this
account it is said also in this passage that when He had spoken these words “He went away
and prayed:” and after He had prayed He speaks thus to His disciples “Could ye not watch
with me one hour? Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation.”695 Seest thou He
not only prays but also admonishes? “For the Spirit indeed is willing,” He said, “but the flesh
is weak.”696 Now this He said by way of emptying their soul of vanity, and delivering them
from pride, teaching them self-restraint, training them to practice moderation. Therefore
the prayer which He wished to teach them, He Himself also offered, speaking after the
manner of men, not according to His Godhead (for the divine nature is impassable) but
according to His manhood. And He prayed as instructing us to pray, and even to seek deliverance
from distress; but, if this be not permitted, then to acquiesce in what seems good to
God. Therefore He said “Nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt:” not because He had
one will and the Father another; but in order that He might instruct men even if they were
in distress and trembling, even if danger came upon them, and they were unwilling to be
torn from present life, nevertheless to postpone their own will to the will of God: even as
Paul also when he had been instructed practically exhibited both these principles; for he
besought that temptations might be removed from him, thus saying “For this thing I besought
the Lord thrice:”697 and yet since it did not please God to remove it, he says “Wherefore I
take pleasure in infirmities, in insults, in persecutions.”698 But perhaps what I have said is
not quite clear: therefore I will make it clearer. Paul incurred many dangers and prayed that
he might not be exposed to them. Then he heard Christ saying “my grace is sufficient for
thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness.”699 As soon then as he saw what the will
of God was, he in future submitted his will to God’s will. By means of this prayer then Christ
taught both these truths, that we should not plunge into dangers, but rather pray that we
may not fall into them; but if they come upon us we should bear them bravely, and postpone
our own will to the will of God. Knowing these things then let us pray that we may never
enter into temptation: but if we do enter it let us beseech God to give us patience and courage,
and let us honour His will in preference to every will of our own. For then we shall pass
through this present life with safety, and shall obtain the blessings to come: which may we
all receive by the favour and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom be to the
Father, together with the Holy Ghost, glory, might, honour, now and for ever world without
end. Amen.</p>

<head>HOMILY ON THE PARALYTIC LET DOWN
THROUGH THE ROOF.</head>
<p>1. Having lately come across the incident of the paralytic 700 who lay upon his bed beside
the pool, we discovered a rich and large treasure, not by delving in the ground, but by diving
into his heart: we found a treasure not containing silver and gold and precious stones, but
endurance, and philosophy, and patience and much hope towards God, which is more
valuable than any kind of jewel or source of wealth. For material riches are liable to the
designs of robbers, and the tales of false accusers, and the violence of housebreakers, and
the villany of servants, and when they have escaped all these things, they often bring the
greatest ruin upon those who possess them by exciting the eyes of the envious, and consequently
breeding countless storms of trouble. But the spiritual riches escape all these occasions
of mischief and are superior to all abuse of this kind, laughing to scorn both robbers,
and housebreakers, and slanderers, and false accusers and death itself. For they are not
parted from the possessor by death, but on the contrary the possession becomes then more
especially secured to the owners, and they accompany them on their journey to the other
world, and are transplanted with them to the future life, and become marvellous advocates
of those with whom they depart hence, and render the judge propitious to them.</p>
<p>This wealth we found in great abundance stored in the soul of the paralytic. And you
are witnesses who with great zeal drew up draughts of this treasure yet without exhausting
it. For such is the nature of spiritual wealth; it resembles fountains of water, or rather exceeds
their plenteousness, being most abundant when it has many to draw upon it. For when it
enters into any man’s soul it is not divided, not diminished, but coming in its entireness to
each remains continually unconsumed, being incapable of ever failing: which was just what
took place at that time. For although so many have applied to the treasure, and all are
drawing upon it as much as they can—but why do I speak of you, seeing that it has made
countless persons rich from that time to the present day, and yet abides in its original perfection?
Let us not then grow weary in having recourse to this source of spiritual wealth:
but as far as possible let us now also draw forth draughts from it, and let us gaze upon our
merciful Lord, gaze upon His patient servant. He had been thirty and eight years struggling
with an incurable infirmity and was perpetually plagued by it, yet he did not repine, he did
not utter a blasphemous word, he did not accuse his Maker, but endured his calamity bravely
<note type="footnote">700 The allusion is most probably to Homily XII. against the Anomoeans, in which Chrysostom proves the
equality of the Divine Son with God the Father by a reference to the cure of the paralytic by the pool of Bethesda.
This Homily against the Anomoeans was delivered at Constantinople, A.D. 398.</note>

<pb n="290"/>
and with much meekness. And whence is this manifest? you say: for Scripture has not told
us anything clearly concerning his former life, but only that he had been thirty-eight years
in his infirmity; it has not added a word to prove that he did not show discontent, or anger
or petulance. And yet it has made this plain also, if any one will pay careful attention to it,
not looking at it curiously and carelessly. For when you hear that on the approach of Christ
who was a stranger to him, and regarded merely as a man, he spoke to him with such great
meekness, you may be able to perceive his former wisdom. For when Jesus said to him “Wilt
thou be made whole?” he did not make the natural reply “thou seest me who have been this
long time lying sick of the palsy, and dost thou ask me if I wish to be made whole? hast thou
come to insult my distress, to reproach me and laugh me to scorn and make a mock of my
calamity? He did not say or conceive anything of this kind but meekly replied “Yea Lord.”701
Now if after thirty-eight; years he was thus meek and gentle, when all the vigour and strength
of his reasoning faculties was broken down, consider what he is likely to have been at the
outset of his trouble. For be assured that invalids are not so hard to please at the beginning
of their disorder, as they are after a long lapse of time: they become most intractable, most
intolerable to all, when the malady is prolonged. But as he, after so many years, was so wise,
and replied with so much forbearance, it is quite clear that during the previous time also he
had been bearing that calamity with much thankfulness.</p>
<p>Considering these things then let us imitate the patience of our fellow-servant: for his
paralysis is sufficient to brace up our souls: for no one can be so supine and indolent after
having observed the magnitude of that calamity as not to endure bravely all evils which may
befall him, even if they are more intolerable than all that were ever known. For not only his
soundness but also his sickness has become a cause of the greatest benefit to us: for his cure
has stimulated the souls of the hearers to speak the praise of the Lord, and his sickness and
infirmity has encouraged you to patience, and urged you to match his zeal; or rather it has
exhibited to you the lovingkindness of God. For the actual deliverance of the man to such
a malady, and the protracted duration of his infirmity is a sign of the greatest care for his
welfare. For as a gold refiner having cast a piece of gold into the furnace suffers it to be
proved by the fire until such time as he sees it has become purer: even so God permits the
souls of men to be tested by troubles until they become pure and transparent and have
reaped much profit from this process of sifting: wherefore this is the greatest species of benefit.</p>
<p>2. Let us not then be disturbed, neither dismayed, when trials befall us. For if the gold
refiner sees how long he ought to leave the piece of gold in the furnace, and when he ought
<note type="footnote">701 We must suppose that Chrysostom considered such words to be implied in the answer actually given.
They are not in the text of John v. 7, but it seems scarcely possible that Chrysostom should have forgotten the
passage, or that the quotation should not have been subsequently corrected if he thought it misleading.</note>

<pb n="291"/>
to draw it out, and does not allow it to remain in the fire until it is destroyed and burnt up:
much more does God understand this, and when He sees that we have become more pure,
He releases us from our trials so that we may not be overthrown and cast down by the
multiplication of our evils. Let us then not be repining, or faint-hearted, when some unexpected
thing befalls us; but let us suffer Him who knows these things accurately, to prove
our hearts by fire as long as He pleases: for He does this for a useful purpose and with a view
to the profit of those who are tried.</p>
<p>On this account a certain wise man admonishes us saying “My Son, if thou come to
serve the Lord prepare thy soul for temptation, set thy heart aright and constantly endure
and make not haste in time of trouble;”702 “yield to Him” he says, “in all things,” for He
knoweth exactly when it is right to pluck us out of the furnace of evil. We ought therefore
everywhere to yield to Him and always to give thanks, and to bear all things contentedly,
whether He bestows benefits or chastisement upon us, for this also is a species of benefit.
For the physician, not only when he bathes and nourishes the patient and conducts him
into pleasant gardens, but also when he uses cautery and the knife, is a physician all the
same: and a father not only when he caresses his son, but also when he expels him from his
house, and when he chides and scourges him, is a father all the same, no less than when he
praises him. Knowing therefore that God is more tenderly loving than all physicians, do not
enquire too curiously concerning His treatment nor demand an account of it from Him,
but whether He is pleased to let us go free or whether He punishes, let us offer ourselves for
either alike; for He seeks by means of each to lead us back to health, and to communion
with Himself, and He knows our several needs, and what is expedient for each one, and how
and in what manner we ought to be saved, and along that path He leads us. Let us then follow
whithersoever He bids us, and let us not too carefully consider whether He commands us
to go by a smooth and easy path, or by a difficult and rugged one: as in the case of this
paralytic. It was one species of benefit indeed that his soul should be purged by the long
duration of his suffering, being delivered to the fiery trial of affliction as to a kind of furnace;
but it was another benefit no less than this that God was present with him in the midst of
the trials, and afforded him great consolation. He it was who strengthened him, and upheld
him, and stretched forth a hand to him, and suffered him not to fall. But when you hear that
it was God Himself do not deprive the paralytic of his meed of praise, neither him nor any
other man who is tried and yet steadfastly endures. For even if we be infinitely wise, even
if we are mightier and stronger than all men, yet in the absence of His grace we shall not be
able to withstand even the most ordinary temptation. And why do I speak of such insignificant
and abject beings as we are? For even if one were a Paul, or a Peter, or a James, or a
John, yet if he should be deprived of the divine help he would easily be put to shame, over-
<note type="footnote">702 Ecclus. i. 1, 2.</note>

<pb n="292"/>
thrown, and laid prostrate. And on behalf of these I will read you the words of Christ Himself:
for He saith to Peter “Behold Satan hath asked to have you that he may sift you as wheat,
but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.”703 What is the meaning of “sift”? to turn
and twist, and shake and stir and shatter, and worry, which is what takes place in the case
of things which are winnowed: but I he says have restrained him, knowing that you are not
able to endure the trial, for the expression “that thy faith fail not” is the utterance of one
who signifies that if he had permitted it his faith would have failed. Now if Peter who was
such a fervent lover of Christ and exposed his life for Him countless times and sprang into
the foremost rank in the Apostolic band, and was pronounced blessed by his Master, and
called Peter on this account because he kept a firm and inflexible hold of the faith, would
have been carried away and fallen from profession if Christ had permitted the devil to try
him as much as he desired, what other man will be able to stand, apart from His help?
Therefore also Paul saith “But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above
that ye are able, but will with the temptation also make the way of escape that ye may be
able to bear it.”704 For not only does He say that He does not suffer a trial to be inflicted
beyond our strength, but even in that which is proportioned to our strength He is present
carrying us through it, and bracing us up, if only we ourselves first of all contribute the
means which are at our disposal, such as zeal, hope in Him, thanksgiving, endurance, patience.
For not only in the dangers which are beyond our strength, but in those which are
proportioned to it, we need the divine assistance, if we are to make a brave stand; for elsewhere
also it is said “even as the sufferings of Christ abound to us, even so our comfort also
aboundeth through Christ, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, by
the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.”705 So then he who comforted
this man is the same who permitted the trial to be inflicted upon him. And now observe
after the cure what tenderness He displays. For He did not leave him and depart, but having
found him in the temple he saith “behold! thou art made whole; sin no more lest some worse
thing happen unto thee.”706 For had He permitted the punishment because He hated him
He would not have released him, He would not have provided for his future safety: but the
expression “lest some worse thing happen unto thee” is the utterance of one who would
check coming evils beforehand. He put an end to the disease, but did not put an end to the
struggle: He expelled the infirmity but did not expel the dread of it, so that the benefit which
had been wrought might remain unmoved. This is the part of a tender-hearted physician,
not only to put an end to present pains, but to provide for future security, which also Christ

<note type="footnote">706 John v. 14.</note>

<pb n="293"/>
did, bracing up his soul by the recollection of past events. For seeing that when the things
which distress us have departed, the recollection of them oftentimes departs with them, He
wishing it to abide continually, saith “sin no more lest some worse thing happen unto thee.”</p>
<p>3. Moreover it is possible to discern His forethought and consideration not only from
this, but also from that which seems to be a rebuke. For He did not make a public exposure
of his sins, but yet He told him that he suffered what he did suffer on account of his sins,
but what those sins were He did not disclose; nor did He say “thou hast sinned” or “thou
hast transgressed,” but He indicated the fact by one simple utterance “sin no more;” and
having said so much as just to remind him of it He put him more on the alert against future
events, and at the same time He made manifest to us all his patience and courage and wisdom,
having reduced him to the necessity of publicly lamenting his calamity, and having displayed
his own earnestness on the man’s behalf, “for while I am coming,” he says, “another steppeth
down before me:”707 yet he did not publicly expose his sins. For just as we ourselves desire
to draw a veil over our sins even so does God much more than we: on this account He
wrought the cure in the presence of all, but He gives the exhortation or the advice privately.
For He never makes a public display of our sins, except at any time He sees men insensible
to them. For when He says “ye saw me hungry, and fed me not: and thirsty and gave me no
drink,”708 He speaks thus at the present time in order that we may not hear these words in
time to come. He threatens, He exposes us in this world, that He may not have to expose
us in the other: even as He threatened to overthrow the city of the Ninevites709 for the very
reason that He might not overthrow it. For if He wished to publish our sins He would not
announce beforehand that He would publish them: but as it is He does make this announcement
in order that being sobered by the fear of exposure, if not also by the fear of punishment
we may purge ourselves from them all. This also is what takes place in the case of baptism:
for He conducts the man to the pool of water without disclosing his sins to any one; yet He
publicly presents the boon and makes it manifest to all, while the sins of the man are known
to no one save God Himself and him who receives the forgiveness of them. This also was
what took place in the case of this paralytic, He makes the reproof without the presence of
witnesses, or rather the utterance is not merely a reproof but also a justification; He justifies
Himself as it were for evil-entreating him so long, telling him and proving to him that it
was not without cause and purpose that He had suffered him to be so long afflicted, for He
reminded him of his sins, and declared the cause of his infirmity. “For having found him,”
we read, “in the temple, He said unto him, sin no more lest some worse thing happen unto
thee.”</p>

<pb n="294"/>
<p>And now since we have derived so much profit from the account of the former paralytic
let us turn to the other who is presented to us in St. Matthew’s Gospel. For in the case of
mines where any one happens to find a piece of gold he makes a further excavation again
in the same place: and I know that many of those who read without care imagine that one
and the same paralytic is presented by the four evangelists: but it is not so. Therefore you
must be on the alert, and pay careful attention to the matter. For the question is not concerned
with ordinary matters, and this discourse when it has received its proper solution will be
serviceable against both Greeks and Jews and many of the heretics. For thus all find fault
with the evangelists as being at strife and variance: yet this is not the fact, Heaven forbid!
but although the outward appearance is different, the grace of the Spirit which works upon
the soul of each is one, and where the grace of the Spirit is, there is love, joy, and peace; and
there war and disputation, strife and contention are not. How then shall we make it clear
that this paralytic is not the same as the other, but a different man? By many tokens, both
of place and time, and season, and day, and from the manner of the cure, and the coming
of the physician and the loneliness of the man who was healed. And what of this? some one
will say: for have not many of the evangelists given diverse accounts of other signs? Yes, but
it is one thing to make statements which are diverse, and another, statements which are
contradictory; for the former causes no discord or strife: but that which is now presented
to us is a strong case of contradiction unless it be proved that the paralytic at the pool was
a different man from him who is described by the other three evangelists. Now that you
may understand what is the difference between statements which are diverse and contradictory,
one of the evangelists has stated that Christ carried the cross,710 another that Simon
the Cyrenian carried it:711 but this causes no contradiction or strife. “And how,” you say,
“is there no contradiction between the statements that he carried and did not carry?” Because
both took place. When they went out of the Prætorium Christ was carrying it: but as they
proceeded Simon took it from Him and bore it. Again in the case of the robbers, one says
that the two blasphemed:712 another that one of them checked him who was reviling the
Lord.713 Yet in this again there is no contradiction: because here also both things took place,
and at the beginning both the men behaved ill: but afterwards when signs occurred, when
the earth shook and the rocks were rent, and the sun was darkened, one of them was converted,
and became more chastened, and recognized the crucified one and acknowledged
his kingdom. For to prevent your supposing that this took place by some constraining force
of one impelling him from within, and to remove your perplexity, he exhibits the man to

you on the cross while he is still retaining his former wickedness in order that you may
perceive that his conversion was effected from within and out of his own heart assisted by
the grace of God and so he became a better man.</p>
<p>4. And it is possible to collect many other instances of this kind from the Gospels, which
seem to have a suspicion of contradiction, where there is no real contradiction, the truth
being that some incidents have been related by this writer, others by that; or if not occurring
at the same hour one author has related the earlier event, another the later; but in the present
case there is nothing of this kind, but the multitude of the evidences which I have mentioned
proves to those who pay any attention whatever to the matter, that the paralytic was not the
same man in both instances. And this would be no slight proof to demonstrate that the
evangelists were in harmony with each other and not at variance. For if it were the same
man the discord is great between the two accounts: but if it be a different one all material
for dispute has been destroyed.</p>
<p>Well then let me now state the actual reasons why I affirm that this man is not the same
as that. What are they? The one is cured in Jerusalem, the other in Capernaum; the one by
the pool of water, the other in some house; there is the evidence from place: the former
during the festival: there is the evidence from the special season: the former had been thirty
and eight years suffering from infirmity: concerning the other the evangelist relates nothing
of that kind: there is the evidence from time: the former was cured on the Sabbath: there is
the evidence from the day: for had this man also been cured on the Sabbath Matthew would
not have passed by the fact in silence nor would the Jews who were present have held their
peace: for they who found fault for some other reason even when a man was not cured on
the Sabbath would have been yet more violent in their accusation against Christ if they had
got an additional handle from the argument of the special day. Moreover this man was
brought to Christ: to the other Christ Himself came, and there was no man to assist him.
“Lord,” said he, “I have no man:” whereas this man had many who came to his aid, who
also let him down through the roof. And He healed the body of the other man before his
soul: for after he had cured the paralysis He then said “Behold thou art made whole, sin no
more:” but not so in this case, but after He had healed his soul, for He said to him “Son be
of good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee,” He then cured his paralysis. That this man then is
not the same as the other has been clearly demonstrated by these proofs, but it now remains
for us to turn to the beginning of the narrative and see how Christ cured the one and the
other, and why differently in each case: why the one on the Sabbath and the other not on
the Sabbath, why He came Himself to the one but waited for the other to be brought to Him,
why He healed the body of the one and the soul of the other first. For He does not these
things without consideration and purpose seeing that He is wise and prudent. Let us then
give our attention and observe Him as He performs the cure. For if in the case of physicians
when they use the knife or cautery or operate in any other way upon a maimed and crippled

<pb n="296"/>
patient, and cut off a limb, many persons crowd round the invalid and the physician who
is doing these things, much more ought we to act thus in this case, in proportion as the
physician is greater and the malady more severe, being one which cannot be corrected by
human art, but only by divine grace. And in the former case we have to see the skin being
cut, and matter discharging, and gore set in motion, and to endure much discomfort produced
by the spectacle, and great pain and sorrow not merely from the sight of the wounds,
but also from the suffering undergone by those who are subjected to this burning or cutting:
for no one is so stony-hearted as to stand by those who are suffering these things, and hear
them shrieking, without being himself overcome and agitated, and experiencing much depression
of spirit; but yet we undergo all this owing to our desire to witness the operation.
But in this case nothing of that kind has to be seen, no application of fire, no plunging in of
an instrument, no flowing of blood, no pain or shrieking of the patient; and the reason of
this is, the wisdom of the healer, which needs none of these external aids, but is absolutely
self-sufficient. For it is enough that He merely utters a command and all distress ceases.
And the wonder is not only that He effects the cure with so much ease, but also without
pain, causing no trouble to those who are being healed.</p>
<p>Seeing then that the marvel is greater and the cure more important, and the pleasure
afforded to the spectators unalloyed by any kind of sorrow, let us now carefully contemplate
Christ in the act of healing. “And He entered into a boat and crossed over and came into
His own city: and behold they brought to him a man sick of the palsy lying on a bed: and
Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy “Son! be of good cheer: thy sins are
forgiven.”714 Now they were inferior to the centurion in respect of their faith, but superior
to the impotent man by the pool. For the former neither invited the physician nor brought
the sick man to the physician; but approached Him as God and said “Speak the word only
and my servant shall be healed.”715 Now these men did not invite the physician to the house,
and so far they are on an equality with the centurion: but they brought the sick man to the
physician and so far they are inferior, because they did not say “speak the word only.” Yet
they are far better than the man lying by the pool. For he said “Lord I have no man when
the water is troubled to put me into the pool:” but these men knew that Christ had no need
either of water, or pool, or anything else of that kind: nevertheless Christ not only released
the servant of the centurion but the other two men also from their maladies, and did not
say: “because thou hast proffered a smaller degree of faith the cure which thou receivest
shall be in proportion;” but He dismissed the man who displayed the greater faith with eulogy
and honour, saying “I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.”716 On the man who
<note type="footnote">714 Matt. ix. 1, 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">715 Luke vii. 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">716 Luke vii. 9.</note>

<pb n="297"/>
exhibited less faith than this one he bestowed no praise yet He did not deprive him of a cure,
no! not even him who displayed no faith at all. But just as physicians when curing the same
disorder receive from some person a hundred gold pieces, from others half, from others
less and from some nothing at all: even so Christ received from the centurion a large and
unspeakable degree of faith, but from this man less and from the other not even an ordinary
amount, and yet He healed them all. For what reason then did He deem the man who made
no deposit of faith worthy of the benefit? Because his failure to exhibit faith was not owing
to indolence, or to insensibility of soul, but to ignorance of Christ and having never heard
any miracle in which He was concerned either small or great. On this account therefore the
man obtained indulgence: which in fact the evangelist obscurely intimates when he says,
“for he wist not who it was,”717 but he only recognized Him by sight when he lighted upon
Him the second time.</p>
<p>5. There are indeed some who say that this man was healed merely because they who
brought him believed; but this is not the fact. For “when He saw their faith” refers not merely
to those who brought the man but also to the man who was brought. Why so? “Is not one
man healed,” you say, “because another has believed?” For my part I do not think so unless
owing to immaturity of age or excessive infirmity he is in some way incapable of believing.
How then was it you say that in the case of the woman of Canaan the mother believed but
the daughter was cured? and how was it that the servant of the centurion who believed rose
from the bed of sickness and was preserved. Because the sick persons themselves were not
able to believe. Hear then what the woman of Canaan says: “My daughter is grievously vexed
with a devil718 and sometimes she falleth into the water and sometimes into the fire:”719
now how could she believe whose mind was darkened and possessed by a devil, and was
never able to control herself, not in her sound senses? As then in the case of the woman of
Canaan so also in the case of the centurion; his servant lay ill in the house, not knowing
Christ, himself, nor who He was. How then was he to believe in one who was unknown to
him, and of whom he had never yet obtained any experience? But in the case before us we
cannot say this: for the paralytic believed. Whence is this manifest? From the very manner
of his approach to Christ. For do not attend simply to the statement that they let the man
down through the roof: but consider how great a matter it is for a sick man to have the
fortitude to undergo this. For you are surely aware that invalids are so faint-hearted and
difficult to please as often to decline the treatment administered to them on their sick bed,
and to prefer bearing the pain which arises from their maladies to undergoing the annoyance

<pb n="298"/>
caused by the remedies. But this man had the fortitude to go outside the house, and to be
carried into the midst of the market place, and to exhibit himself in the presence of a crowd.
And it is the habit of sick folk to die under their disorder rather than disclose their personal
calamities. This sick man however did not act thus, but when he saw that the place of assembly
was filled, the approaches blocked, the haven of refuge obstructed, he submitted to
be let down through the roof. So ready in contrivance is desire, so rich in resource is love.
“For he also that seeketh findeth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.”720 The man
did not say to his friends “What is the meaning of this? why make this ado? why push on?
Let us wait until the house is cleared and the assembly is dissolved: the crowds will withdraw,
we shall then be able to approach him privately and confer about these matters. Why should
you expose my misfortunes in the midst of all the spectators, and let me down from the
roof-top, and behave in an unseemly manner?” That man said none of these things either
to himself or to his bearers, but regarded it as an honour to have so many persons made
witnesses of his cure. And not from this circumstance only was it possible to discern his
faith but also from the actual words of Christ. For after he had been let down and presented
Christ said to him, “Son! be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee.” And when he heard
these words he was not indignant, he did not complain, he did not say to the physician
“What mean you by this? I came to be healed of one thing and you heal another. This is an
excuse and a pretence and a screen of incompetence. Do you forgive sins which are invisible?”
He neither spoke nor thought any of these things, but waited, allowing the physician to adopt
the method of healing which He desired. For this reason also Christ did not go to him, but
waited for him to come, that He might exhibit his faith to all. For could He not have made
the entrance easy? But He did none of these things; in order that He might exhibit the man’s
zeal and fervent faith to all. For as He went to the man who had been suffering thirty and
eight years because he had no one to aid him, so did He wait for this man to come to him
because he had many friends that He might make his faith manifest by the man being brought
to Him, and inform us of the other man’s loneliness by going to him, and disclose the
earnestness of the one and the patience of the other to all and especially to those who were
present. For some envious and misanthropical Jews were accustomed to grudge the benefits
done to their neighbours and to find fault with His miracles, sometimes on account of the
special season, saying that He healed on the sabbath day; sometimes on account of the life
of those to whom the benefit was done, saying “if this man were a prophet He would have
known who the woman was who touched Him:”721 not knowing that it is the special mark
of a physician to associate with the infirm and to be constantly seen by the side of the sick,
not to avoid them, or hurry from their presence—which in fact was what He expressly said
<note type="footnote">720 Luke xi. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">721 Luke vii. 39.</note>

<pb n="299"/>
to those murmurers; “They that are whole have no need of a physician but they that are
sick.”722 Therefore in order to prevent their making the same accusations again He proves
first of all that they who come to Him are deserving of a cure on account of the faith which
they exhibit. For this reason He exhibited the loneliness of one man, and the fervent faith
and zeal of the other: for this reason He healed the one on the Sabbath, the other not on the
Sabbath: in order that when you see them accusing and rebuking Christ on another day you
may understand that they accused him on the former occasion also not because of their respect
for the law, but because they could not contain their own malice. But why did He not
first address Himself to the cure of the paralytic, but said, “Son! be of good cheer, thy sins
are forgiven thee?” He did this very wisely. For it is a habit with physicians to destroy the
originating cause of the malady before they remove the malady itself. Often for example
when the eyes are distressed by some evil humour and corrupt discharge, the physician,
abandoning any treatment of the disordered vision, turns his attention to the head, where
the root and origin of the infirmity is: even so did Christ act: He represses first of all the
source of the evil. For the source and root and mother of all evil is the nature of sin. This it
is which enervates our bodies: this it is which brings on disease: therefore also on this occasion
He said, “Son! be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee.” And on the other He said, “Behold!
thou art made whole, sin no more lest some worse thing happen unto thee,” intimating
to both that these maladies were the offspring of sin. And in the beginning and outset of
the word disease as the consequence of sin attacked the body of Cain. For after the murder
of his brother, after that act of wickedness, his body was subject to palsy.723 For trembling
is the same thing as palsy. For when the strength which regulates a living creature becomes
weakened, being no longer able to support all the limbs, it deprives them of their natural
power of direction, and then having become unstrung they tremble and turn giddy.</p>
<p>6. Paul also demonstrated this: for when he was reproaching the Corinthians with a
certain sin he said, “For this cause many are weak and sickly among you.” Therefore also
Christ first removes the cause of the evil, and having said “Son! be of good cheer, thy sins
are forgiven thee,” He uplifts the spirit and rouses the downcast soul: for the speech became
an efficient cause and having entered into the conscience it laid hold of the soul itself and
cast out of it all distress. For nothing creates pleasure and affords confidence so much as
freedom from self-reproach. For where remission of sins is there is sonship. Even so at least
we are not able to call God Father until we have washed away our sins in the pool of the
sacred water. It is when we have come up from thence, having put off that evil load, that we

<pb n="300"/>
say “Our Father which art in Heaven.” But in the case of the man who was infirm thirty and
eight years why did He not act thus, but cured his body first of all? Because by that long
period of time his sins had been exhausted: for the magnitude of a trial can lighten the load
of sins; as indeed we read was the case with Lazarus, that he received his evil things in full,
and thereupon was comforted: and again in another place we read, “Comfort ye my people,
say ye to the heart of Jerusalem, that she hath received of the Lord’s hand double for her
sins.”724 And again the prophet says “O Lord give us peace, for thou hast requited all things
to us,”725 indicating that penalties and punishments work forgiveness of sins; and this we
might prove from many passages. It seems to me then that the reason why He said nothing
to that man about remission of sins, but only secured him against the future, was because
the penalty for his sins had been already worked out by the long duration of his sickness:
or if this was not the reason, it was because he had not yet attained any high degree of belief
concerning Christ that the Lord first addressed Himself to the lesser need, and one which
was manifest and obvious, the health of the body; but in the case of the other man He did
not act thus, but inasmuch as this man had more faith, and a loftier soul, He spoke to him
first of all concerning the more dangerous disease: with the additional object of exhibiting
his equality of rank with the Father. For just as in the former case He healed on the Sabbath
day because He wished to lead men away from the Jewish mode of observing it, and to take
occasion from their reproaches to prove Himself equal with the Father: even so in this instance
also, knowing beforehand what they were going to say, He uttered these words that
He might use them as a starting-point and a pretext for proving His equality of rank with
the Father. For it is one thing when no one brings an accusation or charge to enter spontaneously
upon a discourse about these things, and quite another when other persons give occasion
for it, to set about the same work in the order and shape of a defence. For the nature
of the former demonstration was a stumbling block to the hearers: but the other was less
offensive, and more acceptable, and everywhere we see Him doing this, and manifesting
His equality not so much by words as by deeds. This at any rate is what the Evangelist implied
when he said that the Jews persecuted Jesus not only because He broke the Sabbath but also
because He said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with God,726 which is a
far greater thing, for He effected this by the demonstration of His deeds. How then do the
envious and wicked act, and those who seek to find a handle in every direction? “Why does
this man blaspheme?” they say for “no man can forgive sins save God alone.”727 As they
persecuted Him there because He broke the Sabbath, and took occasion from their reproaches
<note type="footnote">724 Isa. xl. 1, 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">725 Isa. xxvi. 12.</note>
<note type="footnote">726 John v. 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">727 Mark ii. 7.</note>

<pb n="301"/>
to declare His equality with the Father in the form of a defence, saying “my Father worketh
hitherto and I work,”728 so here also starting from the accusations which they make He
proves from these His exact likeness to the Father. For what was it they said? “No man can
forgive sins save God alone.” Inasmuch then as they themselves laid down this definition,
they themselves introduced the rule, they themselves declared the law, He proceeds to entangle
them by means of their own words. “You have confessed,” He says, “that forgiveness
of sins is an attribute of God alone: my equality therefore is unquestionable.” And it is not
these men only who declare this but also the prophet thus saying: “who is God as thou?”
and then, indicating His special attribute he adds “taking away iniquity and passing over
unrighteousness.”729 If then any one else appears thus doing the same thing He also is God,
God even as that one is God. But let us observe how Christ argues with them, how meekly
and gently, and with all tenderness. “And behold some of the scribes said within themselves:
this man blasphemeth.” They did not utter the word, they did not proclaim it through the
tongue, but reasoned in the secret recesses of their heart. How then did Christ act? He made
public their secret thoughts before the demonstration which was concerned with the cure
of the paralytic’s body, wishing to prove to them the power of His Godhead. For that it is
an attribute of God alone, a sign of His deity to shew the secrets of His mind, the Scripture
saith “Thou alone knowest men’s hearts.”730 Seest thou that this word “alone,” is not used
with a view of contrasting the Son with the Father. For if the Father alone knows the heart,
how does the Son know the secrets of the mind? “For He Himself” it is said, “knew what
was in man;”731 and Paul when proving that the knowledge of secret things is a special attribute
of God says, “and He that searchest the heart,”732 shewing that this expression is
equivalent to the appellation “God.” For just as when I say “He who causeth rain said,” I
signify none other than God by mentioning the deed, since it is one which belongs to Him
alone: and when I say “He who maketh the sun to rise,” without adding the word God, I yet
signify Him by mentioning the deed: even so when Paul said “He who searcheth the hearts,”
he proved that to search the heart is an attribute of God alone. For if this expression had
not been of equal force with the name “God” for pointing out Him who was signified, he
would not have used it absolutely and by itself. For if the power were shared by Him in
common with some created being, we should not have known who was signified, the community
of power causing confusion in the mind of the hearers. Inasmuch then as this appears
<note type="footnote">728 John v. 17.</note>
<note type="footnote">729 Micah vii. 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">730 1 Kings viii. 39.</note>
<note type="footnote">731 John ii. 25.</note>
<note type="footnote">732 Rom. viii. 27.</note>

<pb n="302"/>
to be a special attribute of the Father, and yet is manifested of the Son whose equality becomes
thence unquestionable, therefore we read “why think ye evil in your hearts? for whether is
easier: to say: Thy sins are forgiven thee or to say arise and walk?”</p>
<p>7. See moreover He makes a second proof of His power of forgiving sins. For to forgive
sins is a very much greater act than to heal the body, greater in proportion as the soul is
greater than the body. For as paralysis is a disease of the body, even so sin is a disease of the
soul: but although this is the greater it is not palpable: whereas the other although it be less
is manifest. Since then He is about to use the less for a demonstration of the greater proving
that He acted thus on account of their weakness, and by way of condescension to their feeble
condition He says “whether is easier? to say thy sins are forgiven thee or to say arise and
walk?” For what reason then should He address Himself to the lesser act on their account?
Because that which is manifest presents the proof in a more distinct form. Therefore He did
not enable the man to rise until He had said to them “But that ye may know that the Son of
man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith He to the sick of the palsy) arise and
walk:” as if He had said: forgiveness of sins is indeed a greater sign: but for your sakes I add
the less also since this seems to you to be a proof of the other. For as in another case when
He praised the centurion for saying “speak the word only and my servant shall be healed:
for I also say to this man go and he goeth and to the other come and he cometh,” He confirmed
his opinion by the eulogy which He pronounced: and again when He reproved the
Jews for finding fault with Him on the Sabbath day saying that He transgressed the law, He
proved that He had authority to alter laws: even so in this instance also when some said “He
maketh Himself equal with God by promising that which belongs only to the Father,” He
having upbraided and accused them and proved by His deeds that He did not blaspheme
supplied us with indisputable evidence that He could do the same things as the Father who
begat Him. Observe at least the manner in which He pleases to establish the fact that what
belongs to the Father only, belongs also to Himself: for He did not simply enable the paralytic
to get up, but also said “but that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth
to forgive sins:” thus it was his endeavour and earnest desire to prove above all things that
He had the same authority as the Father.</p>
<p>8. Let us then carefully hold fast all these things, both those which were spoken yesterday
and the day before that, and let us beseech God that they may abide immoveably in our
heart, and let us contribute zeal on our side, and constantly meet in this place. For in this
way we shall preserve the truths which have been formerly spoken, and we shall add others
to our store; and if any of them slip from our memory through the lapse of time we shall
easily be able to recover them by the aid of continual teaching. And not only will the doctrines
abide sound and uncorrupt but our course of life will have the benefit of much diligent care
and we shall be able to pass through this present state of existence with pleasure and cheerfulness.
For whatever kind of suffering is oppressing our soul when we come here will easily

<pb n="303"/>
be got rid of: seeing that now also Christ is present, and he who approaches Him with faith
will readily receive healing from Him. Suppose some one is struggling with perpetual poverty,
and at a loss for necessary food, and often goes to bed hungry, if he has come in here, and
heard Paul saying that he passed his time in hunger and thirst and nakedness, and that he
experienced this not on one or two or three days, but constantly (this at least is what he indicates
when he says “up to the present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked”),733
he will receive ample consolation, learning by means of these words that God has not permitted
him to be in poverty because He hated him or abandoned him: for if this were the
effect of hatred, He would not have permitted it in the case of Paul who was of all men especially
dear to Him: but He permitted it out of His tender love and providential care, and by
way of conducting him to a higher degree of spiritual wisdom. Has some other man a body
which is beset with disease and countless sufferings? The condition of these paralytics may
be an ample source of consolation and besides these the blessed and brave disciple of Paul
who was continually suffering from disorders, and never had any respite from prolonged
infirmity, even as Paul also said “Use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often
infirmities,”734 where he does not speak merely of infirmities as such. Or another having
been subjected to false accusation has acquired a bad reputation with the public, and this is
continually vexing and gnawing his soul: he enters this place and hears “Blessed are ye when
men shall reproach you and say all manner of evil against you falsely: rejoice ye and be exceeding
glad for great is your reward in Heaven:”735 then he will lay aside all despondency
and receive every kind of pleasure: for it is written “leap for joy, and be exceeding glad when
men cast out your name as evil.”736 In this manner then God comforts those that are evil
spoken of, and them that speak evil He puts in fear after another manner saying “every evil
word which men shall speak they shall give an account thereof whether it be good or evil.”737</p>
<p>Another perhaps has lost a little daughter or a son, or one of his kinsfolk, and he also
having come here listens to Paul groaning over this present life and longing to see that which
is to come, and oppressed by his sojourn in this world, and he will go away with a sufficient
remedy for his grief when he has heard him say “Now concerning them that are asleep I
would not have you ignorant brethren that ye sorrow not even as others who have no
hope.”738 He did not say concerning the dying, but “concerning them that are asleep”
proving that death is a sleep. As then if we see any one sleeping we are not disturbed or
<note type="footnote">733 1 Cor. iv. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">734 1 Tim. v. 23.</note>
<note type="footnote">735 Matt. v. 11, 12.</note>
<note type="footnote">736 Luke vi. 22, 23.</note>
<note type="footnote">737 Matt. xii. 36.</note>
<note type="footnote">738 1 Thess. iv. 13.</note>

<pb n="304"/>
distressed, expecting that he will certainly get up: even so when we see any one dead, let us
not be disturbed or dejected for this also is a sleep, a longer one indeed, but still a sleep. By
giving it the name of slumber He comforted the mourners and overthrew the accusation of
the unbelievers. If you mourn immoderately over him who has departed you will be like
that unbeliever who has no hope of a resurrection. He indeed does well to mourn, inasmuch
as he cannot exercise any spiritual wisdom concerning things to come: but thou who hast
received such strong proofs concerning the future life, why dost thou sink into the same
weakness with him? Therefore it is written “now concerning them that are asleep we would
not have you ignorant that ye sorrow not even as others who have no hope.”</p>
<p>And not only from the New Testament but from the Old also it is possible to receive
abundant consolation. For when you hear of Job after the loss of his property, after the destruction
of his herds, after the loss not of one, or two, or three, but of a whole troop of sons
in the very flower of their age, after the great excellence of soul which he displayed, even if
thou art the weakest of men, thou wilt easily be able to repent and regain thy courage. For
thou, O man, hast constantly attended thy sick son, and hast seen him laid upon the bed,
and hast heard him uttering his last words, and stood beside him whilst he was drawing his
last breath and hast closed his eyes, and shut his mouth: but he was not present at the death
struggle of his sons, he did not see them breathing their last gasp, but the house became the
common grave of them all, and on the same table brains and blood were poured forth, and
pieces of wood and tiles, and dust, and fragments of flesh, and all these things were mingled
together in like manner. Nevertheless after such great calamities of this kind he was not
petulant, but what does he say—“The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; as it seemed
good unto the Lord even so has it come to pass, blessed be the name of the Lord for ever.”739
Let this speech be our utterance also over each event which befalls us; whether it be loss of
property, or infirmity of body, or insult, or false accusation or any other form of evil incident
to mankind, let us say these words “The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; as it seemed
good to the Lord so has it come to pass; blessed be the name of the Lord for ever.” If we
practise this spiritual wisdom, we shall never experience any evil, even if we undergo
countless sufferings, but the gain will be greater than the loss, the good will exceed the evil:
by these words thou wilt cause God to be merciful unto thee, and wilt defend thyself against
the tyranny of Satan. For as soon as thy tongue has uttered these words forthwith the Devil
hastens from thee: and when he has hastened away, the cloud of dejection also is dispelled
and the thoughts which afflict us take to flight, hurrying off in company with him, and in
addition to all this thou wilt win all manner of blessings both here and in Heaven. And you
have a convincing example in the case of Job, and of the Apostle, who having for God’s sake
despised the troubles of this world, obtained the everlasting blessings. Let us then be trustful
<note type="footnote">739 Job i. 21, LXX. version.</note>

<pb n="305"/>
and in all things which befall us let us rejoice and give thanks to the merciful God, that we
may pass through this present life with serenity, and obtain the blessings to come, by the
grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ to whom be glory, honour and might always,
now and ever, world without end. Amen.</p>

HOMILY
TO THOSE WHO HAD NOT ATTENDED THE ASSEMBLY:
AND ON THE APOSTOLIC SAYING, “IF THINE ENEMY HUNGER,
FEED HIM, ETC. (ROM. XII. 20), AND CONCERNING RESENTMENT
OF INJURIES.</p>

<head>TO THOSE WHO HAD NOT ATTENDED THE ASSEMBLY.</head>
<p>To those who had not attended the assembly; on the apostolic saying, “If thy enemy hunger
feed him,” and concerning resentment of injuries.</p>
<p>1. I did no good as it seems by the prolonged discourse which I lately addressed to you
with a view to kindling your zeal for the assemblies here:740 for again our Church is destitute
of her children. Wherefore also I am again compelled to seem vexatious and burdensome,
reproving those who are present, and finding fault with those who have been left behind:
with them because they have not put away their sloth, and with you because you have not
given a helping hand to the salvation of your brethren. I am compelled to seem burdensome
and vexatious, not on behalf of myself, or my own possessions, but on your behalf and for
your salvation, which is more precious to me than anything else. Let him who pleases take
it in bad part, and call me insolent and impudent, yet will I not cease continually annoying
him for the same purpose; for nothing is better for me than this kind of impudence. For it
may be, it may be, that this at least if nothing else, will put you to shame, and that to avoid
being perpetually importuned concerning the same things, ye will take part in the tender
care of your brethren. For what profit is there to me in praise when I do not see you making
advances in virtue? and what harm is there from the silence of the hearers when I behold
your piety increasing? For the praise of the speaker does not consist in applause, but in the
zeal of the hearers for godliness: not in noise made just at the time of hearing, but in lasting
earnestness. As soon as applause has issued from the lips it is dispersed in air and perishes;
but the moral improvement of the hearers brings an imperishable and immortal reward
both to him who speaks and to them who obey. The praise of your cheers makes the
speaker illustrious here, but the piety of your soul affords the teacher much confidence before
the judgment-seat of Christ. Wherefore if any one loves the speaker, let him not desire the
applause but the profit of the hearers. To neglect our brethren is no ordinary wrong, but
one which brings extreme punishment, and an inexorable penalty. And the case of the man
who buried the talent proves this: he was not reproached at least on account of his own life:
for as regarded the deposit itself he did not turn out a bad man, since he restored it intact:
nevertheless he did turn out a bad man as regarded his management of the deposit. For he
did not double that which was entrusted to him; and so was punished. Whence it is manifest
that even if we are earnest and well trained, and have much zeal about hearing the holy
<note type="footnote">740 The date of this Homily cannot be determined, but the allusions which it contains to the Imperial palace
and guard, and some other points of internal evidence prove that it was delivered at Constantinople.</note>

<pb n="308"/>
scriptures this does not suffice for our salvation. For the deposit must be doubled, and it
becomes doubled when together with our own salvation we undertake to make some provision
for the good of others. For the man in the parable said “Lo! there thou hast that is
thine:” but this did not serve him for a defence: for it was said to him “thou oughtest to have
put the money to the exchangers.”741</p>
<p>And observe I pray how easy the commands of the Master are: for men indeed make
those who lend out capital sums at interest answerable for recalling them; “you have made
the deposit,” one says, “you must call it in: I have no concern with the man who has received
it.” But God does not act thus; He only commands us to make the deposit, and does not
render us liable for the recall. For the speaker has the power of advising, not of persuading.
Therefore he says: “I make thee answerable for depositing only, and not for the recall.” What
can be easier than this? And yet the servant called the master hard, who was thus gentle and
merciful. For such is the wont of the ungrateful and indolent; they always try to shift the
blame of their offences from themselves to their master. And therefore the man was thrust
out with torture and bonds into the outer darkness. And lest we should suffer this penalty
let us deposit our teaching with the brethren, whether they be persuaded by it, or not. For
if they be persuaded they will profit both themselves and us: and if they are not, they involve
themselves indeed in inevitable punishment, but will not be able to do us the slightest injury.
For we have done our part, by giving them advice: but if they do not listen to it no harm
will result to us from that. For blame would attach to us not for failing to persuade, but for
failing to advise: and after prolonged and continual exhortation and counsel they and not
we, have to reckon henceforth with God.</p>
<p>I have been anxious at any rate to know clearly, whether you continue to exhort your
brethren, and if they remain all the time in the same condition of indolence: otherwise I
would never have given you any trouble: as it is, I have fears that they may remain uncorrected
in consequence of your neglect and indifference. For it is impossible that a man who continually
has the benefit of exhortation and instruction should not become better and more
diligent. The proverb which I am about to cite is certainly a common one, nevertheless it
confirms this very truth. For “a perpetual dropping of water” it says, “wears a rock,” yet
what is softer than water? and what is harder than a rock? Nevertheless perpetual action
conquers nature: and if it conquers nature much more will it be able to prevail over the
human will. Christianity is no child’s play, my beloved: no matter of secondary importance.
I am continually saying these things, and yet I effect nothing.</p>
<p>2. How am I distressed, think you, when I call to mind that on the festival days the
multitudes assembled resemble the broad expanse of the sea, but now not even the smallest
part of that multitude is gathered together here? Where are they now who oppress us with
<note type="footnote">741 Matt. xxv. 27.</note>

<pb n="309"/>
their presence on the feast days? I look for them, and am grieved on their account when I
mark what a multitude are perishing of those who are in the way of salvation,742 how large
a loss of brethren I sustain, how few are reached by the things which concern salvation, and
how the greater part of the body of the Church is like a dead and motionless carcase. “And
what concern is that to us?” you say. The greatest possible concern if you pay no attention
to your brethren, if you do not exhort and advise, if you put no constraint on them, and do
not forcibly drag them hither, and lead them away out of their deep indolence. For that one
ought not to be useful to himself alone, but also to many others, Christ declared plainly,
when He called us salt,743 and leaven,744 and light:745 for these things are useful and profitable
to others. For a lamp does not shine for itself, but for those who are sitting in darkness:
and thou art a lamp not that thou mayest enjoy the light by thyself, but that thou mayest
bring back yonder man who has gone astray. For what profit is a lamp if it does not give
light to him who sits in darkness? and what profit is a Christian when he benefits no one,
neither leads any one back to virtue? Again salt is not an astringent to itself but braces up
those parts of the body which have decayed, and prevents them from falling to pieces and
perishing. Even so do thou, since God has appointed thee to be spiritual salt, bind and brace
up the decayed members, that is the indolent and sordid brethren, and having rescued them
from their indolence as from some form of corruption, unite them to the rest of the body
of the Church. And this is the reason why He called you leaven: for leaven also does not
leaven itself, but, little though it is, it affects the whole lump however big it may be. So also
do ye: although ye are few in number, yet be ye many and powerful in faith, and in zeal towards
God. As then the leaven is not weak on account of its littleness, but prevails owing
to its inherent heat, and the force of its natural quality, so ye also will be able to bring back
a far larger number than yourselves, if you will, to the same degree of zeal as your own. Now
if they make the summer season their excuse: for I hear of their saying things of this kind,
“the present stifling heat is excessive, the scorching sun is intolerable, we cannot bear being
trampled and crushed in the crowd, and to be steaming all over with perspiration and oppressed
by the heat and confined space:” I am ashamed of them, believe me: for such excuses
<note type="footnote">742 τῶν σωζομ™νων, this signifies “members of the Church,” merely, who, as such, are heirs of salvation, or

are womanish: indeed even in their case who have softer bodies, and a weaker nature, such
pretexts do not suffice for justification. Nevertheless, even if it seems a disgrace to make a
reply to a defence of this kind, yet is it necessary. For if they put forward such excuses as
these and do not blush, much more does it behove us not to be ashamed of replying to these
things. What then am I to say to those who advance these pretexts? I would remind them
of the three children in the furnace and the flame, who when they saw the fire encircling
them on all sides, enveloping their mouth and their eyes and even their breath, did not cease
singing that sacred and mystical hymn to God, in company with the universe, but standing
in the midst of the pyre sent up their song of praise to the common Lord of all with greater
cheerfulness than they who abide in some flowery field:746 and together with these three
children I should think it proper to remind them also of the lions which were in Babylon,
and of Daniel and the den:747 and not of this one only but also of another den, and the
prophet Jeremiah, and the mire in which he was smothered up to the neck.748 And emerging
from these dens, I would conduct these persons who put forward heat as an excuse into the
prison and exhibit Paul to them there, and Silas bound fast in the stocks, covered with bruises
and wounds lacerated all over their body with a mass of stripes, yet singing praises to God
at midnight and celebrating their holy vigil. For is it not a monstrous thing that those holy
men, both in the furnace and the fire, and the den, and amongst wild beasts, and mire, and
in a prison and the stocks, and amidst stripes and gaolers, and intolerable sufferings, never
complained of any of these things, but were continually uttering prayers and sacred songs
with much energy and fervent zeal, whilst we who have not undergone any of their innumerable
sufferings small or great, neglect our own salvation on account of a scorching sun and
a little short lived heat and toil, and forsaking the assembly wander away, depraving ourselves
by going to meetings which are thoroughly unwholesome? When the dew of the divine oracles
is so abundant dost thou make heat thy excuse? “The water which I will give him,” saith
Christ “shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life;”749 and again; “He
that believeth on me as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living
water.”750 Tell me; when thou hast spiritual wells and rivers, art thou afraid of material
heat? Now in the market place where there is so much turmoil and crowding, and scorching
wind, how is it that you do not make suffocation and heat an excuse for absenting yourself?
For it is impossible for you to say that there you can enjoy a cooler temperature, and that
all the heat is concentrated here with us:—the truth is exactly the reverse; here indeed owing

to the pavement floor, and to the construction of the building in other respects (for it is
carried up to a vast height), the air is lighter and cooler: whereas there the sun is strong in
every direction, and there is much crowding, and vapour and dust, and other things which
add to discomfort far more than these. Whence it is plain that these senseless excuses are
the offspring of indolence and of a supine disposition, destitute of the fire of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>3. Now these remarks of mine are not so much directed to them, as to you who do not
bring them forward, do not rouse them from their indolence, and draw them to this table
of salvation. Household slaves indeed when they have to discharge some service in common,
summon their fellow slaves, but you when you are going to meet for this spiritual ministry
suffer your fellow servants to be deprived of the advantage by your neglect. “But what if
they do not desire it?” you say. Make them desire it by your continual importunity: for if
they see you insisting upon it they certainly will desire it. Nay these things are a mere excuse
and pretence. How many fathers at any rate are there here who have not their sons standing
with them? Was it so difficult for thee to bring hither some of thy children? Whence it is
clear that the absence of all the others who remain outside is due not only to their own indolence,
but also to your neglect. But now at least, if never before, rouse yourselves up, and
let each person enter the Church accompanied by a member of his family: let them incite
and urge one another to the assembly here, the father his son, the son his father, the husbands
their wives, and the wives their husbands, the master his slave, brother his brother, friend
his friend: or rather let us not summon friends only but also enemies to this common
treasury of good things. If thy enemy sees thy care for his welfare, he will undoubtedly relinquish
his hatred.</p>
<p>Say to him: “art thou not ashamed and dost thou not blush before the Jews who keep
their sabbath with such great strictness, and from the evening of it abstain from all work?
And if they see the sun verging towards setting on the day of the Preparation they break off
business, and cut short their traffic: and if any one who has been making a purchase from
them, before the evening, comes in the evening bringing the price, they do not suffer
themselves to take it, or to accept the money.” And why do I speak of the price of market
wares and transaction of business? Even if it were possible to receive a treasure they would
rather lose the gain than trample on their law. Are the Jews then so strict, and this when
they keep the law out of due season, and cling to an observance of it which does not profit
them, but rather does them harm: and wilt thou, who art superior to the shadow, to whom
it has been vouchsafed to see the Sun of Righteousness, who art ranked as a citizen of the
Heavenly commonwealth, wilt thou not display the same zeal as those who unseasonably
cleave to what is wrong, thou who hast been entrusted with the truth, but although thou art
summoned here for only a short part of the day, canst thou not endure to spend even this
upon the hearing of the divine oracles? and what kind of indulgence, pray, could you obtain?
and what answer will you have to make which is reasonable and just? It is utterly impossible

<pb n="312"/>
that one who is so indifferent and indolent should ever obtain indulgence, even if he should
allege the necessities of worldly affairs ten thousand times over as an excuse. Do you not
know that if you come and worship God and take part in the work which goes on here, the
business you have on hand is made much easier for you? Have you worldly anxieties? Come
here on that account that by the time you spend here you may win for yourself the favour
of God, and so depart with a sense of security; that you may have Him for your ally, that
you may become invincible to the dæmons because you are assisted by the heavenly hand.
If you have the benefit of prayers uttered by the fathers, if you take part in common prayer,
if you listen to the divine oracles, if you win for yourself the aid of God, if, armed with these
weapons, you then go forth, not even the devil himself will be able henceforth to look you
in the face, much less wicked men who are eager to insult and malign you. But if you go
from your house to the market place, and are found destitute of these weapons, you will be
easily mastered by all who insult you. This is the reason why both in public and private affairs,
many things occur contrary to our expectation, because we have not been diligent about
spiritual things in the first place, and secondarily about the secular, but have inverted the
order. For this reason also the proper sequence and right arrangement of things has been
upset, and all our affairs are full of much confusion. Can you imagine what distress and
grief I suffer when I observe, that if a public holy day and festival is at hand there is a concourse
of all the inhabitants of the city, although there is no one to summon them; but when
the holy day and festival are past, even if we should crack our voice by continuing to call
you all day long there is no one who pays any heed? For often when turning these things
over in my mind I have groaned heavily, and said to myself: What is the use of exhortation
or advice, when you do everything merely by the force of habit, and do not become a whit
more zealous in consequence of my teaching? For whereas in the festivals you need no exhortation
from me, but, when they are past you profit nothing by my teaching, do you not
show that my discourse, so far as you are concerned, is superfluous?</p>
<p>4. Perhaps many of those who hear these things are grieved. But such is not the sentiment
of the indolent: else they would put away their carelessness, like ourselves, who are daily
anxious about your affairs. And what gain do you make by your secular transactions in
proportion to the damage you sustain? It is impossible to depart from any other assembly,
or gathering, in the possession of so much gain as you receive from the time spent here,
whether it be the law court, or council-chamber, or even the palace itself. For we do not
commit the administration of nations or cities nor the command of armies to those who
enter here, but another kind of government more dignified than that of the empire itself;
or rather we do not ourselves commit it, but the grace of the spirit.</p>
<p>What then is the government, more dignified than that of the empire, which they who
enter here receive? They are trained to master untoward passions, to rule wicked lusts, to
command anger, to regulate ill-will, to subdue vainglory. The emperor, seated on the imper-

<pb n="313"/>
ial throne, and wearing his diadem, is not so dignified as the man who has elevated his own
inward right reason to the throne of government over base passions, and by his dominion
over them has bound as it were a glorious diadem upon his brow. For what profit is there,
pray, in purple, and raiment wrought with gold, and a jewelled crown, when the soul is in
captivity to the passions? What gain is there in outward freedom when the ruling element
within us is reduced to a state of disgraceful and pitiable servitude. For just as when a fever
penetrates deep, and inflames all the inward parts, there is no benefit to be got from the
outward surface of the body, although it is not affected in the same way: even so when our
soul is violently carried away by the passion within, no outward government, not even the
imperial throne, is of any profit, since reason is deposed from the throne of empire by the
violent usurpation of the passions, and bows and trembles beneath their insurrectionary
movements. Now to prevent this taking place prophets and apostles concur on all sides in
helping us, repressing our passions, and expelling all the ferocity of the irrational element
within us, and committing a mode of government to us far more dignified than the empire.
This is why I said that they who deprive themselves of this care751 receive a blow in the vital
parts, sustaining greater damage than can be inflicted from any other quarter inasmuch as
they who come here get greater gain than they could derive from any other source: even as
Scripture has declared. The law said “Thou shalt not appear before the Lord empty;”752 that
is, enter not into the temple without sacrifices. Now if it is not right to go into the house of
God without sacrifices, much more ought we to enter the assembly accompanied by our
brethren: for this sacrifice and offering is better than that, when thou bringest a soul with
thee into the Church. Do you not see doves which have been trained, how they hunt for
others when they are let out? Let us also do this. For what kind of excuse shall we have, if
irrational creatures are able to hunt for an animal of their own species, while we who have
been honoured with reason and so much wisdom neglect this kind of pursuit? I exhorted
you in my former discourse with these words: “Go, each of you to the houses of your
neighbours, wait for them to come out, lay hold of them, and conduct them to their common
mother: and imitate those who are mad upon theatre going, who diligently arrange to meet
each other and so wait at early dawn to see that iniquitous spectacle.” Yet I have not effected
anything by this exhortation. Therefore I speak again and shall not cease speaking, until I
have persuaded you. Hearing profits nothing unless it is accompanied by practice. It makes
our punishment heavier, if we continually hear the same things and do none of the things
which are spoken. That the chastisement will be heavier, hear the statement of Christ. “If I
had not come and spoken to them they had not sin: but now they have no cloke for their
<note type="footnote">751 i.e., the care of their brethren. That this is the meaning appears from what follows.</note>
<note type="footnote">752 Exod. xxiii. 15.</note>

<pb n="314"/>
sin.”753 And the Apostle says “for not the hearers of the law shall be justified.”754 These
things He says to the hearers; but when He wishes to instruct the speaker also, that even he
will not gain anything from his teaching unless his behaviour is in close correspondence
with his doctrine, and his manner of life is in harmony with his speech, hear how the Apostle
and the prophet address themselves to him: for the latter says “but to the sinner said God,
why dost thou preach my laws and takest my covenant in thy mouth, whereas thou hast
hated instruction?”755 And the Apostle, addressing himself to these same again who thought
great things of their teaching, speaks on this wise: “Thou art confident that thou thyself art
a leader of the blind, a light of those who are in darkness, an instructor of the foolish, a
teacher of babes: thou therefore that teachest another teachest thou not thyself?”756 Inasmuch
then as it could neither profit me the speaker to speak, nor you the hearers to hear, unless
we comply with the things which are spoken, but rather would increase our condemnation,
let us not limit the display of our zeal to hearing only, but let us observe what is said, in our
deeds. For it is indeed a good thing to spend time continually in hearing the divine oracles:
but this good thing becomes useless when the benefit to be derived from hearing is not
linked with it.</p>
<p>Therefore that you may not assemble here in vain I shall not cease beseeching you with
all earnestness, as I have often besought you before, “conduct your brethren to us, exhort
the wanderers, counsel them not by word only but also by deed.” This is the more powerful
teaching—that which comes through our manners and behaviour—Even if you do not utter
a word, but yet, after you have gone out of this assembly, by your mien, and your look, and
your voice and all the rest of your demeanour you exhibit to the men who have been left
behind the gain which you have brought away with you, this is sufficient for exhortation
and advice. For we ought to go out from this place as it were from some sacred shrine, as
men who have descended from heaven itself, who have become sedate, and philosophical,
who do and say everything in proper measure: and when a wife sees her husband returning
from the assembly, and a father his son, and a friend his friend, and an enemy his enemy,
let them all receive an impression of the benefit which you have derived from coming here:
and they will receive it, if they perceive that you have become milder, more philosophical,
more devout. Consider what privileges you enjoy who hast been initiated into the mysteries,
757 with what company thou offerest up that mystic hymn, with what company thou

<note type="footnote">757 i.e., admitted to Holy Communion, which catechumens were not permitted to witness.</note>

<pb n="315"/>
criest aloud the “Ter sanctus.” Teach “them that are without” that thou hast joined the
chorus of the Seraphim, that thou art ranked as a citizen of the commonwealth above, that
thou hast been enrolled in the choir of Angels, that thou hast conversed with the Lord, that
thou hast been in the company of Christ. If we regulate ourselves in this way we shall not
need to say anything, when we go out to those who are left behind: but from our advantage
they will perceive their own loss and will hasten hither, so as to enjoy the same benefits
themselves. For when, merely by the use of their senses, they see the beauty of your soul
shining forth, even if they are the most stupid of men, they will become enamoured of your
goodly appearance. For if corporeal beauty excites those who behold it, much more will
symmetry of soul be able to move the spectator, and stimulate him to equal zeal. Let us then
adorn our inward man, and let us be mindful of the things which are said here, when we go
out: for there especially is it a proper time to remember them; and just as an athlete displays
in the lists the things which he has learned in the training school: even so ought we to display
in our transactions in the world without the things which we have heard here.</p>
<p>5. Bear in mind then the things which are said here, that when you have gone out and
the devil lays hold of you either by means of anger or vainglory, or any other passion, you
may call to remembrance the teaching which you have received here and may be able easily
to shake off the grasp of the evil one. Do you not see the wrestling-masters in the practising
grounds, who, after countless contests having obtained exemption from wrestling on account
of their age, sit outside the lines by the side of the dust and shout to those who are wrestling
inside, telling one to grasp a hand, or drag a leg, or seize upon the back, and by many other
directions of that kind, saying, “if you do so and so you will easily throw your antagonist,”
they are of the greatest service to their pupils? Even so do thou look to thy training master,
the blessed Paul, who after countless victories is now sitting outside the boundary, I mean
this present life, and cries aloud to us who are wrestling, shouting out by means of his
Epistles, when he sees us overcome by wrath and resentment of injuries, and choked by
passion; “if thy enemy hunger feed him, if he thirst give him drink;”758—a beautiful precept
full of spiritual wisdom, and serviceable both to the doer and the receiver. But the reminder
of the passage causes much perplexity, and does not seem to correspond to the sentiment
of him who uttered the former words. And what is the nature of this? the saying that “by so
doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.” For by these words he does a wrong both
to the doer and the receiver: to the latter by setting his head on fire, and placing coals upon
it; for what good will he get from receiving food and drink in proportion to the evil he will
suffer from the heaping of coals on his head? Thus then the recipient of the benefit is
wronged, having a greater vengeance inflicted on him, but the benefactor also is injured in
another way. For what can he gain from doing good to his enemies when he acts in the hope
<note type="footnote">758 Rom. xii. 20.</note>

<pb n="316"/>
of revenge? For he who gives meat and drink to his enemy for the purpose of heaping coals
of fire on his head would not become merciful and kind, but cruel and harsh, having inflicted
an enormous punishment by means of a small benefit. For what could be more unkind than
to feed a person for the purpose of heaping coals of fire on his head? This then is the contradiction:
and now it remains that the solution should be added, in order that by those very
things which seem to do violence to the letter of the law you may clearly see all the wisdom
of the lawgiver. What then is the solution?</p>
<p>That great and noble-minded man was well aware of the fact that to be reconciled quickly
with an enemy is a grievous and difficult thing; grievous and difficult, not on account of its
own nature, but of our moral indolence. But he commanded us not only to be reconciled
with our enemy, but also to feed him; which was far more grievous than the former. For if
some are infuriated by the mere sight of those who have annoyed them, how would they be
willing to feed them when they were hungry? And why do I speak of the sight infuriating
them? If any one makes mention of the persons, and merely introduces their name in society,
it revives the wound in our imagination, and increases the heat of passion. Paul then being
aware of all these things and wishing to make what was hard and difficult of correction
smooth and easy, and to persuade one who could not endure to see his enemy, to be ready
to confer that benefit already mentioned upon him, added the words about coals of fire, in
order that a man prompted by the hope of vengeance might hasten to do this service to one
who had annoyed him. And just as the fisherman surrounding the hook on all sides with
the bait presents it to the fishes in order that one of them hastening to its accustomed food
may be captured by means of it and easily held fast: even so Paul also wishing to lead on the
man who has been wronged to bestow a benefit on the man who has wronged him does not
present to him the bare hook of spiritual wisdom, but having covered it as it were with a
kind of bait, I mean the “coals of fire,” invites the man who has been insulted, in the hope
of inflicting punishment, to confer this benefit on the man who has annoyed him; but when
he has come he holds him fast in future, and does not let him make off, the very nature of
the deed attaching him to his enemy; and he all but says to him: “if thou art not willing to
feed the man who has wronged thee for piety’s sake: feed him at least from the hope of
punishing him.” For he knows that if the man once sets his hand to the work of conferring
this benefit, a starting-point is made and a way of reconciliation is opened for him. For
certainly no one would have the heart to regard a man continually as his enemy to whom
he has given meat and drink, even if he originally does this in the hope of vengeance. For
time as it goes on relaxes the tension of his anger. As then the fisherman, if he presented
the bare hook would never allure the fish, but when he has covered it gets it unawares into
the mouth of the creature who comes up to it: so also Paul if he had not advanced the expectation
of inflicting punishment would never have persuaded those who were wronged to
undertake to benefit those who had annoyed them. Wishing then to persuade those who

<pb n="317"/>
recoiled in disgust, and were paralysed by the very sight of their enemies, to confer the
greatest benefits upon them, he made mention of the coals of fire, not with a view of
thrusting the persons in question into inexorable punishment, but in order that when he
had persuaded those who were wronged to benefit their enemies in the expectation of
punishing them, he might afterwards in time persuade them to abandon their anger altogether.</p>
<p>6. Thus then did he encourage the man who has been wronged; but observe also how
he unites again the man who has done the wrong to him who has been provoked. First of
all by the very manner of the benefit: (for there is no one so degraded and unfeeling as to
be unwilling, when he receives meat and drink, to become the servant and friend of him
who does this for him): and in the second place through the dread of vengeance. For the
passage, “by so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head” seems indeed to be addressed
to the person who gives the food; but it more especially touches him who has caused the
annoyance, in order that through fear of this punishment he may be deterred from remaining
continually in a state of enmity, and being aware that the reception of food and drink might
do him the greatest mischief if he constantly retains his animosity, may suppress his anger.
For thus he will be able to quench the coals of fire. Wherefore the proposed punishment
and vengeance both induces the one who has been wronged to benefit him who has annoyed
him, and it deters and checks him who has given the provocation, and impels him to reconciliation
with the man who gives him meat and drink. Paul therefore linked the two persons
by a twofold bond, the one depending on a benefit, the other on an act of vengeance. For
the difficulty is to make a beginning and to find an opening for the reconciliation: but when
that has once been cleared in whatever way it may be, all which follows will be smooth and
easy. For even if at first the man who has been annoyed feeds his enemy in the hope of
punishing him, yet becoming his friend by the act of giving him food he will be able to expel
the desire of vengeance. For when he has become a friend he will no longer feed the man
who has been reconciled to him, with an expectation of this kind. Again he who has given
the provocation, when he sees the man who has been wronged electing to give him meat
and drink, casts out all his animosity, both on account of this deed, and also of his fear of
the punishment which is in store for him, even if he be excessively hard and harsh and stony
hearted, being put to shame by the benevolence of him who gives him food, and dreading
the punishment reserved for him, if he continues to be an enemy after accepting the food.</p>
<p>For this reason Paul did not stop even here in his exhortation, but when he has emptied
each side of wrath he proceeds to correct their disposition, saying, “be not overcome of evil.”
“For if,” he says, “you continue to bear resentment and to seek revenge you seem indeed to
conquer your enemy, but in reality you are being conquered by evil, that is, by wrath: so
that if you wish to conquer, be reconciled, and do not make an attack upon your adversary;”
for a brilliant victory is that in which by means of good, that is to say by forbearance, you

<pb n="318"/>
overcome evil, expelling wrath and resentment. But the injured man, when inflamed with
passion would not have borne these words. Therefore when he had satisfied his wrath he
proceeded to conduct him to the best reason for reconciliation, and did not permit him to
remain permanently animated by the wicked hope of vengeance. Dost thou perceive the
wisdom of the lawgiver? And that you may learn that he introduced this law only on account
of the weakness of those who would not otherwise be content to make terms amongst
themselves, hear how Christ, when He ordained a law on this same subject did not propose
the same reward, as the Apostle; but, having said “Love your enemies, do good to them that
hate you,” which means give them food and drink, He did not add “for in so doing ye shall
heap coals of fire on their heads:” but what did He say? “that ye may become like your
Father who is in Heaven.”759 Naturally so, for He was discoursing to Peter, James, and John
and the rest of the apostolic band: therefore He proposed that reward. But if you say that
even on this understanding the precept is onerous you improve once more the defence
which I am making for Paul, but you deprive yourself of every plea of indulgence. For I can
prove to you that this which seems to you onerous was accomplished under the Old Dispensation
when the manifestation of spiritual wisdom was not so great as it is now. For this
reason also Paul did not introduce the law in his own words, but used the very expressions
which were employed by him who originally brought it in, that he might leave no room for
excuse to those who do not observe it: for the precept “if thine enemy hunger feed him, if
he thirst give him drink” is not the utterance of Paul in the first instance, but of Solomon.760
For this reason he quoted the words that he might persuade the hearer that for one who has
been advanced to such a high standard of wisdom to regard an old law as onerous and
grievous which was often fulfilled by the men of old time, is one of the basest things possible.
Which of the ancients, you ask, fulfilled it? There were many, but amongst others David
especially did so more abundantly. He did not indeed merely give food or drink to his enemy,
but also rescued him several times from death, when he was in jeopardy; and when he had
it in his power to slay him he spared him once, twice, yea many times. As for Saul he hated
and abhorred him so much after the countless good services which he had done, after his
brilliant triumphs, and the salvation which he had wrought in the matter of Goliath, that
he could not bear to mention him by his own name, but called him after his father. For once
when a festival was at hand, and Saul, having devised some treachery against him, and
contrived a cruel plot, did not see him arrive—“where,” said he, “is the son of Jesse?”761 He
called him by his father’s name, both because on account of his hatred he could not endure
the recollection of his proper name, and also because he thought to damage the distinguished
<note type="footnote">759 Matt. v. 44.</note>

<note type="footnote">761 1 Sam. xx. 23.</note>

<pb n="319"/>
position of that righteous man by a reference to his low birth;—a miserable and despicable
thought: for certainly, even if he had some accusation to bring against the father this could
in no wise injure David. For each man is answerable for his own deeds, and by these he can
be praised and accused. But as it was, not having any evil deed to mention, he brought forward
his low birth, expecting by this means to throw his glory into the shade, which in fact
was the height of folly. For what kind of offence is it to be the child of insignificant and
humble men, “the son of Jesse,” but when David found him sleeping inside the cave, he did
not call him the “son of Kish,” but by his title of honour: “for I will not lift up my hand,” he
said, “against the Lord’s anointed.”762 So purely free was he from wrath and resentment of
injuries: he calls him the Lord’s anointed who had done him such great wrongs, who was
thirsting for his blood, who after his countless good services had many times attempted to
destroy him. For he did not consider how Saul deserved to be treated, but he considered
what was becoming for himself both to do and to say, which is the greatest stretch of moral
wisdom. How so? When thou hast got thy enemy in a prison, made fast by a twofold, or
rather by a triple chain, confinement of space, dearth of assistance, and necessity of sleep,
dost thou not demand a penalty and punishment of him? “No,” he says; “for I am not now
regarding what he deserves to suffer, but what it behoves me to do.” He did not look to the
facility for slaying, but to the accurate observance of the moral wisdom which was becoming
to him. And yet which of the existing circumstances was not sufficient to prompt him to
the act of slaughter? Was not the fact that his enemy was delivered bound into his hands a
sufficient inducement? For you are aware I suppose that we hasten more eagerly to deeds
for which facilities abound, and the hope of success increases our desire to act, which was
just what happened then in his case.</p>
<p>Well! did the captain who then counselled and urged him to the deed,763 did the memory
of past events induce him to slay? no one of these things moved him: in fact the very facility
for slaughter averted him from it: for he bethought him that God had put Saul in his hands
for the purpose of furnishing ample ground and opportunity for the exercise of moral wisdom.
You then perhaps admire him, because he did not cherish the memory of any of his
past evils: but I am much more astonished at him for another reason. And what is this? that
the fear of future events did not impel him to lay violent hands on his enemy. For he knew
clearly that if Saul escaped his hands, he would again be his adversary; yet he preferred exposing
himself to danger by letting go the man who had wronged him, to providing for his
own security by laying violent hands upon his foe. What could equal then the great and
generous spirit of this man, who, when the law commanded eye to be plucked out for eye,
and tooth for tooth, and retaliation on equal terms,764 not only abstained from doing this,
<note type="footnote">762 1 Sam. xxvi. 11.</note>
<note type="footnote">763 Abishai. 1 Sam. xxvi. 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">764 Deut. xix. 21.</note>

<pb n="320"/>
but exhibited a far greater measure of moral wisdom? At least if he had slain Saul at that
time he would have retained credit for moral wisdom unimpaired, not merely because he
had acted on the defensive, not being himself the originator of violence, but also because
by his great moderation he was superior to the precept “an eye for an eye.” For he would
not have inflicted one slaughter in return for one; but, in return for many deaths, which
Saul endeavoured to bring on him, having attempted to slay him not once or twice but many
times, he would have brought only one death on Saul; and not only this, but if he had proceeded
to avenge himself out of fear of the future, even this, combined with the things already
mentioned, would procure him the reward of forbearance without any deduction. For he
who is angry on account of the things which have been done to him, and demands satisfaction
would not be able to obtain the praise of forbearance: but when a man dismisses the consideration
of all past evils, although they are many and painful, but is compelled to take steps
for self-defence from fear of the future, and by way of providing for his own security, no
one would deprive him of the rewards of moderation.</p>
<p>7. Nevertheless David did not act even thus, but found a novel and strange form of
moral wisdom: and neither the remembrance of things past, nor the fear of things to come,
nor the instigation of the captain, nor the solitude of the place, nor the facility for slaying,
nor anything else incited him to kill; but he spared the man who was his enemy, and had
given him pain just as if he was some benefactor, and had done him much good. What kind
of indulgence then shall we have, if we are mindful of past transgressions, and avenge
ourselves on those who have given us pain, whereas that innocent man who had undergone
such great sufferings and expected more and worse evils to befall him in consequence of
saving his enemy, is seen to spare him, so as to prefer incurring danger himself and to live
in fear and trembling, rather than put to a just death the man who would cause him endless
troubles?</p>
<p>His moral wisdom then we may perceive, not only from the fact that he did not slay
Saul, when there was so strong a compulsion, but also that he did not utter an irreverent
word against him, although he who was insulted would not have heard him. Yet we often
speak evil of friends when they are absent, he on the contrary not even of the enemy who
had done him such great wrong. His moral wisdom then we may perceive from these things:
but his lovingkindness and tender care from what he did after these things. For when he
had cut off the fringe of Saul’s garment, and had taken away the bottle of water he withdrew
afar off and stood and shouted, and exhibited these things to him whose life he had preserved,
doing so not with a view to display and ostentation, but desiring to convince him by his
deeds that he suspected him without a cause as his enemy, and aiming therefore at winning
him into friendship. Nevertheless when he had even thus failed to persuade him, and could
have laid hands on him, he again chose rather to be an exile from his country and to sojourn
in a strange land, and suffer distress every day, in procuring necessary food than to remain

<pb n="321"/>
at home and vex his adversary. What spirit could be kinder than his? He was indeed justified
in saying “Lord remember David and all his meekness.”765 Let us also imitate him, and let
us neither say nor do evil to our enemies, but benefit them according to our power: for we
shall do more good to ourselves than to them. “For if ye forgive your enemies,” we are told
“ye shall be forgiven.”766 Forgive base offences that thou mayest receive a royal pardon for
thy offences; but if any one has done thee great wrongs, the greater the wrongs you forgive,
the greater will be the pardon which you will receive. Therefore we have been instructed to
say “Forgive us, as we forgive,” that we may learn that the measure of our forgiveness takes
its beginning in the first place from ourselves. Wherefore in proportion to the severity of
the evil which the enemy does to us is the greatness of the benefit which he bestows. Let us
then be earnest and eager to be reconciled with those who have vexed us, whether their
wrath be just or unjust. For if thou art reconciled here, thou art delivered from judgment
in the other world; but if in the interval while the hatred is still going on, death interrupting
steps in and carries the enmity away with it, it follows of necessity that the trial of the case
should be brought forward in the other world. As then many men when they have a dispute
with one another, if they come to a friendly understanding together outside the law court
save themselves loss, and alarm, and many risks, the issue of the case turning out in accordance
with the sentiment of each party; but if they severally entrust the affair to the judge the
only result to them will be loss of money, and in many cases a penalty, and the permanent
endurance of their hatred; even so here if we come to terms during our present life we shall
relieve ourselves from all punishment; but if while remaining enemies we depart to that
terrible tribunal in the other world we shall certainly pay the utmost penalty at the sentence
of the judge there, and shall both of us undergo inexorable punishment: he who is unjustly
wroth because he is thus unjustly disposed, and he who is justly wroth, because he has,
however justly, cherished resentment. For even if we have been unjustly ill-treated, we ought
to grant pardon to those who have wronged us. And observe how he urges and incites those
who have unjustly given pain to reconciliation with those whom they have wronged. “If
thou offerest thy gift before the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought
against thee, go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother.”767 He did not say, “assemble,
and offer thy sacrifice” but “be reconciled and then offer it.” Let it lie there, he says, in order
that the necessity of making the offering may constrain him who is justly wroth to come to
terms even against his will. See how he again prompts us to go to the man who has provoked
us when he says “Forgive your debtors in order that your Father may also forgive your
<note type="footnote">765 Psalm cxxxii. 1, the LXX. translation has not very accurately rendered the original. “Trouble,” or “anxiety,”
as in our English version, is the meaning of the word here rendered “meekness.”</note>

<note type="footnote">767 Matt. v. 23, 24.</note>

<pb n="322"/>
trespasses.” For He did not propose a small reward, but one which far exceeds the magnitude
of the achievement. Considering all these things then, and counting the recompense which
is given in this case and remembering that to wipe away sins does not entail much labour
and zeal, let us pardon those who have wronged us. For that which others scarcely accomplish,
I mean the blotting out of their own sins by means of fasting and lamentations, and prayers,
and sackcloth, and ashes, this it is possible for us easily to effect without sackcloth and ashes
and fasting if only we blot out anger from our heart, and with sincerity forgive those who
have wronged us. May the God of peace and love, having banished from our soul all wrath
and bitterness, and anger, deign to grant that we being closely knit one to another according
to the proper adjustment of the parts,768 may with one accord, one mouth and one soul
continually offer up our hymns of thanksgiving due to Him: for to Him be glory and power
for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

HOMILY
AGAINST PUBLISHING THE ERRORS OF THE BRETHREN,

<head>AGAINST PUBLISHING THE ERRORS OF THE
BRETHREN.</head>
<head>HOMILY.</head>
<p>Upon the not publishing the errors of the Brethren, nor uttering imprecations upon enemies.</p>
<p>1. I account you happy for the zeal, beloved, with which you flock into the Father’s
house. For from this zeal I have ground for feeling confidence about your health also with
respect to the soul; for indeed the school of the Church is an admirable surgery—a surgery,
not for bodies, but for souls. For it is spiritual, and sets right, not fleshly wounds, but errors
of the mind,769 and of these errors and wounds the medicine is the word. This medicine is
compounded, not from the herbs growing on the earth, but from the words proceeding
from heaven—this no hands of physicians, but tongues of preachers have dispensed. On
this account it lasts right through; and neither is its virtue impaired by length of time, nor
defeated by any strength of diseases. For certainly the medicines of physicians have both
these defects; for while they are fresh they display their proper strength, but when much
time has passed; just as those bodies which have grown old; they become weaker; and often
too the difficult character of maladies is wont to baffle them; since they are but human.
Whereas the divine medicine is not such as this; but after much time has intervened, it still
retains all its inherent virtue. Ever since at least Moses was born (for from thence dates the
beginning of the Scripture) it has healed so many human beings; and not only has it not lost
its proper power, but neither has any disease ever yet overcome it. This medicine it is not
possible to get by payment of silver; but he who has displayed sincerity of purpose and disposition
goes his way having it all. On account of this both rich and poor alike obtain the
benefit of this healing process. For where there is a necessity to pay down money the man
of large means indeed shares the benefit; but the poor man often has to go away deprived
of the gain, since his income does not suffice him for the making up of the medicine. But
in this case, since it is not possible to pay down silver coin, but it is needful to display faith
and a good purpose, he who has paid down these with forwardness of mind, this is he who
most reaps the advantage; since indeed these are the price paid for the medicinal treatment.
And the rich and the poor man share the benefit alike; or rather it is not alike that they share
the benefit, but often the poor man goes away in the enjoyment of more. What ever can be
<note type="footnote">769 διανοίας. In Chrysostom equivalent to the νοῦς of St. Paul (Rom. xii. 2); the moral and spiritual mind.

<pb n="325"/>
the reason? It is because the rich man, possessed beforehand by many thoughts, having the
pride and puffed-up temper belonging to wealthiness; living with carelessness and lazy ease
as companions, receives the medicine of the hearing of the Scriptures not with much attention,
nor with much earnestness; but the poor man, far removed from delicate living and
gluttony and indolence; spending all his time in handicraft and honest labours; and gathering
hence much love of wisdom for the soul; becomes thereby more attentive and free from
slackness, and is wont to give his mind with more accurate care to all that is said: whence
also, inasmuch as the price he has paid is higher, the benefit which he departs having reaped
is greater.</p>
<p>2. It is not as absolutely bringing an accusation against those who are wealthy that I say
all this; nor as praising the poor without reference to circumstances: for neither is wealth
an evil, but the having made a bad use of wealth; nor is poverty a virtue, but the having made
a virtuous use of poverty. That rich man who was in the time of Lazarus was punished,770
not because he was rich, but because he was cruel and inhuman. And that poor man who
rested in the bosom of Abraham was praised, not because he was poor, but because he had
borne his poverty with thankfulness.</p>
<p>For of things—(now attend carefully to this saying; for it will avail to put into you sufficient
religious knowledge, and to cast out all unsound reasoning, and to bring about your
having your judgment right concerning the truth of things)—well, of things some are by
nature morally good, and others the contrary; and others neither good nor evil, but they
occupy the intermediate position. A good thing piety is by nature, impiety an evil thing; a
good thing virtue, an evil thing wickedness; but wealth and poverty in themselves are neither
the one nor the other; but from the will of those who use them they become either the one
or the other. For if thou hast used thy wealth for purposes of philanthropy, the thing becomes
to thee a foundation of good; but if for rapine and grasping and insolence, thou hast turned
the use of it to the direct opposite; but for this wealth is not chargeable, but he who has used
his wealth for insolence. So also we may say of poverty: if thou have borne it nobly by giving
thanks to the Master, what has been done becomes to thee a cause and ground for receiving
crowns; but if on account of this thou blaspheme thy Creator, and accuse Him for His
providence, thou hast again used the thing to an evil purpose. But just as in that case it is
not wealth that is responsible for the avarice, but the person who has made a bad use of
wealth, so also here we are not to lay the blame of the blasphemy on poverty, but on him
who did not choose to bear the thing in a sober spirit. For in every case both the praise and
the blame belong to our own will and choice. Good is wealth, yet not absolutely, but to him
only to whom it is not sin; and again poverty is wicked, but not absolutely, but only in the

<pb n="326"/>
mouth of the impious, because he is discontented, because he blasphemes, because he is
indignant, because he accuses Him who has made him.</p>
<p>3. Let us not therefore accuse riches, nor revile poverty absolutely, but those who do
not will771 to use these virtuously; for the things themselves lie in the middle. But as I was
saying (for it is good to return to the former subject), both rich and poor enjoy the benefit
of the medicines administered here with the same boldness and freedom; and often the poor
with more earnestness. For the special excellence of the medicines is not this only, that they
heal souls, that their virtue is not destroyed by length of time, that they are not worsted by
any disease, that the benefit is publicly offered gratuitously, that the healing treatment is on
a footing of equality both for rich and poor—but they have another quality also not inferior
to these good points. Pray of what character is this? It is that we do not publicly expose those
who come to this surgery. For they who go off to the surgeries of the outside world, have
many who examine their wounds, and unless the physician have first uncovered the sore,
he does not apply the dressing; but here not so, but seeing as we do innumerable patients,
we go through the medical treatment of them in a latent manner. For not by dragging into
publicity those who have sinned do we thus noise abroad the sins committed by them; but
after putting forth our teaching, as common to all, we leave it entirely to the conscience of
the hearers; so that each may draw to himself from what is said the suitable medicine for
his own wound. For there proceeds the word of doctrine from the tongue of the speaker,
containing accusation of wickedness, praise of virtue, blame of lewdness, commendation
of chasteness, censure of pride, praise of gentleness, just as a medicine of varied and manifold
ingredients, compounded from every kind; and to take what is applicable to himself and
salutary is the part of each of the hearers. The word then issues openly, and settling into the
conscience of each, secretly both affords the healing treatment which comes from it, and
before the malady has been divulged, has often restored health.</p>
<p>4. You at all events heard yesterday how I extolled the power of prayer, how I reproached
those who pray with listlessness; without having publicly exposed one of them. Those then
who were conscious to themselves of earnestness, accepted that commendation of prayer,
and became still more earnest by the praises, while those who were conscious to themselves
of listlessness, accepted on the other hand the rebuking, and put off their carelessness. But
neither these nor those do we know; and this ignorance is serviceable to both—how, I now
tell you. He who has heard the commendations of prayer and is conscious to himself of
earnestness, were he to have many witnesses of the commendations, would have lapsed towards
pride; but, as it is, by having secretly accepted the praise, he is removed from all arrogance.
On the other hand he who is conscious to himself of listlessness, having heard the
<note type="footnote">771 'Εθ™λοντας. In its theological sense. “Θ™λημα σαρκός.” Not a classical, but an ecclesiastical word (John
i. 13). So our Lord, εἰ' τις θ™λει, has the will.</note>

<pb n="327"/>
accusation, has become better from the accusation, as having no one of men a witness of
the rebuking; and this was of no ordinary profit to him. For on account of the being flurried
at the opinion of the vulgar,772 so long as we may think that we escape notice in our
wickedness, we exert ourselves to become better; but when we have become notorious to
all, and have lost the consolation derived from the escaping notice, we grow more shameless
and remiss rather. And just as sores become more painful by being unbandaged and frequently
exposed to cold air, so also the soul after having sinned, if in the presence of many
it be rebuked for what it has done amiss, grows thereby more shameless. In order therefore
that this might not take place, the word administered its medicine to you covertly. And that
you may understand773 that the gain which this covert treatment has is great, hear what the
Christ says. “If thy brother have committed a fault against thee convince him of it,” and he
did not say “between him and the whole town,” nor, “between thee and the whole people,”774
but “only between thee and him.” Let the accusation, he says, be unwitnessed to, in order
that the change to amendment may be made easy of digestion. A great good surely, the
making the advice unpublished. Sufficient is the conscience, sufficient that incorruptible
judge. It is not so much thou who rebukest him who has done wrong as his own conscience
(that accuser is the sharper), nor dost thou do it with the more exact knowledge of the faults
committed. Add not therefore wound to wound by exposing him who has done wrong; but
administer for thyself the counsel unwitnessed. This therefore we are doing now—the very
thing that Paul also did, framing the indictment against him who among the Corinthians
had sinned without citing of witnesses. And hear how. “On this account,” he says, “brethren,
I have applied these figures of speech to myself and Apollos.” And yet not he himself nor
Apollos were they who had rent the people in schism and divided the Church; but all the
same he concealed the accusation, and just as by some masks, by hiding the countenances
of the defendants by his own and Apollos’ names, he afforded them power to amend of that
wickedness. And again, “Lest in some way after I have come God humble me, and I may
have to mourn many of those who have before sinned, and have not repented over the uncleanness
and lasciviousness which they had committed.”775 See how here also he indefinitely
mentions those who had sinned, in order that he might not, by openly bringing the accusation,
render the soul of those who had sinned more shameless. Therefore, just as we administer
our reproofs with so much sparing of your feelings, so do ye also with all seriousness
receive the correction; and attend with carefulness to what is said.</p>

<p>5. We discoursed to you yesterday about the power which is in prayer. I pointed out776
how the devil then lies in wait, deceiver that he is. For since he sees very great gain accruing
to us from prayer, then most he assails us, in order that he may disable us from our defence;
777 that he may send us off home empty-handed. And just as before magistrates, when
the officers of the court who are about the person of the magistrate have a hostile feeling
toward those who come before him, they by their staves drive them away to a distance,
preventing their coming near and resorting to lamentation and so obtaining compassion;
so also the devil, when he has seen us coming to the judge, drives us away to a distance, not
by any staff, but through our own slackness. For he knows, he knows clearly, that if they
have come to him in a sober spirit, and have told the sins committed, and have mourned
with their soul fervent, they will depart having received full forgiveness; for God loves
mankind; and on this account he is beforehand with them, and debars them from access,778
in order that they may obtain no one of the things which they need. But the soldiers of magistrates
with violence scare away those who are coming to them; but he with no compulsion,
but by deceiving us, and throwing us into security. On this account we are not deserving
even of allowance, since we voluntarily deprive ourselves of the good things. Prayer with
earnestness is a light of the understanding and soul—a light unquenchable and perpetual.
On this account he throws into our minds countless rubbish-heaps of imaginations; and
things which we never had imagined, these collecting together at the very moment of prayer
he pours down upon our souls. And just as winds often rushing from an opposite quarter
by a violent gust extinguish a lamp’s flame as it is being lighted, so also the devil, when he
has seen the flame of our prayer being kindled, blowing it on every side with the blasts of
countless thoughts, does not desist before and until he has quenched the light. But the very
thing which they who are kindling those lamps do, this let us also do. And what do they do?
When they see a violent wind coming, by laying their finger upon the opening of the lamp
they bar the entrance against the wind. For so long as he assails from without we shall be
able to stand against him; but when we have opened to him the doors of the mind, and have
received the enemy inside; after that we are no longer able to withstand even a little; but,
having on all sides completely extinguished the memory,779 just as a smoking lamp, he allows
our mouth to utter empty words. But just as they put their finger upon the opening of the
lamp, so let us lay consideration upon our mind: let us close off from the wicked spirit the
entrance, in order that he may not quench our light of prayer. Remember both those illus-

trations, both that of the soldiers and the magistrate, and that respecting the lamp. For with
this purpose we adduce to you these illustrations; with which we are conversant, in which
we live, in order that, after we have departed hence and have returned home, we may from
things of familiar occurrence receive a reminder of what has been said.</p>
<p>6. Prayer is a strong piece of armour and a great security. You heard yesterday how the
three children, fettered as they were, destroyed the power of the fire; how they trampled
down the blaze; how they overcame the furnace, and conquered the operation of the element.
Hear to-day again how the noble and great Isaac overcame the nature itself of bodies through
prayer. They destroyed780 the power of fire, this man to-day loosed the bonds of incapacitated
nature. And learn how he effected this. “Isaac,” it says, “prayed781 concerning his wife, because
she was barren.” This has to-day been read to you; yesterday the sermon was about
prayer; and to-day again there is a demonstration of the power of prayer. See how the grace
of the Spirit has ordered that what has been read to-day harmonises with what was said
yesterday. “Isaac,” it says, “prayed concerning Rebecca his wife, because she was barren.”
This first is worth inquiring into, for what cause she was barren. She was of a life admirable
and replete with much chastity—both herself and her husband. We cannot lay hold782 of
the life of those just ones, and say that the barrenness was the work of sin. And not only was
she herself barren, but also his mother Sarah, who had borne him; not only was his mother
barren and his wife, but also his daughter-in-law, the wife of Jacob, Rachel. What is the
meaning of this band of barren ones? All were righteous, all living in virtue, all were witnessed
to by God. For it was of them that He said, “I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob.” Of the same persons Paul also thus speaks. “For which cause God is
not ashamed to call himself their God.”783 Many are the commendations of them in the
New, many the praises of them in the Old Testament. On all sides they were bright and illustrious,
and yet they all had barren wives, and continued in childlessness until an advanced
period. When therefore thou seest man and wife living with virtue; when thou seest them
beloved of God, caring for piety, and yet suffering the malady of childlessness; do not suppose
that the childlessness is at all a retribution for sins. For many are God’s reasons for the dispensation,
and to us inexplicable; and for all we must be heartily thankful, and think those
only wretched who live in wickedness; not those who do not possess children. Often God
does it expediently, though we know not the cause of events. On this account in every case
it is our duty to admire His wisdom, and to glorify His unspeakable love of man.</p>

<p>7. Well,784 this consideration indeed is able to school us in moral character, but it is
necessary also to state the cause for which those women were barren. What then was the
cause? It was in order that when thou hast seen the Virgin bringing forth our common
Master, thou mightest not disbelieve. Wherefore exercise thy mind in the womb of the
barren; in order that when thou hast seen the womb, disabled and bound as it is, being
opened to the bearing of children from the grace of God, thou mightest not marvel at
hearing that a virgin has brought forth. Or rather even marvel and be astounded; but do
not disbelieve the marvel. When the Jew says to thee, “how did the virgin bear?” say to him
“how did she bear who was barren and enfeebled by old age?” There were then two
hindrances, both the unseasonableness of her age and the unserviceableness of nature; but
in the case of the Virgin there was one hindrance only, the not having shared in marriage.
The barren one therefore prepares the way for the virgin. And that thou mayest learn that
it was on this account that the barren ones had anticipated it, in order that the Virgin’s
childbirth might be believed, hear the words of Gabriel which were addressed to her—For
when he had come and said to her, “thou shalt conceive in the womb and bear a son, and
thou shalt call his name Jesus;” the Virgin was astonished and marvelled, and said, “how
will this be to me, since I know not a man.” What then said the Angel? “The Holy Ghost
shall come upon thee.” Seek not the sequence of nature, he says, when that which takes place
is above nature; look not round for marriage and throes of child-birth, when the manner
of the birth is too grand for marriage. “And how will this be,” she says, “since I know not a
husband.” And verily on this account shall this be, since thou knowest no husband. For
didst thou know a husband, thou wouldest not have been deemed worthy to serve this
ministry. So that, for the reason why thou disbelievest, for this believe. And thou wouldest
not have been deemed worthy to serve this ministry, not because marriage is an evil; but
because virginity is superior; and right it was that the entry of the Master should be more
august than ours; for it was royal, and the king enters through one more august. It was necessary
that He should both share as to birth, and be diverse from ours. Wherefore both
these things are managed.</p>
<p>For the being born from the womb is common in respect to us, but the being born
without marriage is a thing greater than on a level with us. And the gestation and conception
in the belly belongs to human nature; but that the pregnancy should take place without
sexual intercourse is too august for human nature.785 And for this purpose both these things

<pb n="331"/>
took place, in order that thou mayest learn both the pre-eminence and the fellowship with
thee of Him who was born.</p>
<p>8. And pray consider the wisdom of all that was done. Neither did the pre-eminence
injure the likeness and kinship to us, nor did the kinship to us dim the pre-eminence; but
both were displayed by all the circumstances; and the one had our condition in its entirety,
and the other what was diverse compared with us. But just as I was saying, on this account
the barren ones went before, in order that the Virgin’s child-birth might be believed, that
she786 might be led by the hand to faith in that promise and undertaking which she heard
from the angel, saying, “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the miraculous power787
of the Most High shall overshadow thee”—thus, he says, thou art able to bear. Look not to
the earth; it is from the heavens that the operation will come. That which takes place is a
grace of the Spirit; pray inquire not about nature and laws of marriage. But since those words
were too high for her, he wills to afford also another demonstration. But do thou, pray, observe
how the barren one leads her on the way to the belief in this. For since that demonstration
was too high for the Virgin’s intelligence, hear how he brought down what he said to
lower things also, leading her by the hand by sensible facts. For “behold,” he says, “Elizabeth
thy kinswoman—she also has conceived a son in her old age; and this month is the sixth to
her who was called barren.” Seest thou that the barren one was for the sake of the Virgin?
since with what object did he adduce to her the child-bearing of her kinswoman? with what
object did he say, “in her old age?” with what object did he add, “who was called barren?”
It was by way of inducing her by all these things, manifestly, to the believing the glad annunciation.
For this cause he spoke of both the age and the disabling effect of nature; for this
cause he awaited the time also which had elapsed from the conception; for he did not tell
to her the glad tidings immediately from the beginning,788 but awaited for a six-months
period to have passed to the barren one, in order that the puerperal swelling might, for the
rest, be a pledge of the pregnancy, and an indisputable demonstration might arise of the
conception. And pray again look at the intelligence of Gabriel. For he neither reminded
her789 of Sarah, nor of Rebecca, nor of Rachel; and yet they also were barren, and they had
grown old, and that which took place was a marvel; but the stories were ancient. Now things
new and recent and occurring in our generation are wont to induce us into the belief of
marvels more than those which are old. On this account having let those women alone, that
she should understand from her kinswoman Elizabeth herself what was coming upon her,

he brought it forward; so as from her to lead her to her own—that most awful and august
childbirth. For the child-birth of the barren one lay between ours and that of the Master
less indeed than that of the Virgin, but greater than ours. On this account it was by Elizabeth
lying between, just as by some bridge, that he lifted up the mind of the Virgin from the
travail which is according to nature, to that which is above nature.</p>
<p>9. I did desire to say more, and to teach you other reasons for which Rebecca, and Rachel,
were barren; but the time does not permit; urging on the discourse to the power of prayer.
For on this account indeed I have mooted all these points, that ye might understand how
the prayer of Isaac unbound the barrenness of his wife; and that prayer for so long a time.
“Isaac,” it says, “continually prayed about Rebecca his wife, and God listened to him.” For
do not suppose that he invoked God and had immediately been listened to; for he had spent
much time in praying to God. And if you desire to learn how much, I will tell you this too
with exactness. He had spent the number of twenty years in praying to God. Whence is this
manifest? from the sequence itself. For the Scripture, desiring to point out the faith and the
endurance and the love of wisdom of that righteous man, did not break off and leave untold
even the time, but made it also clear to us, covertly indeed, so as to rouse up our indolence;
but nevertheless did not allow it to be uncertain. Hear then how it covertly indicated to us
the time. “Now Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebecca, a daughter of Bethuel the
Syrian.” You hear how many years old he was when he brought home his wife: “Forty years
old,” it says, “he was when he took Rebecca.” But since we have learnt how many years old
he was when he married his wife, let us learn also when he after all became a father, and
how many years old he was then, when he begat Jacob; and we shall be able to see how long
a time his wife had remained barren; and that during all that time he continued to pray to
God. How many years old then was he when he begat Jacob? “Jacob,” it says, “came forth
laying hold with his right hand of his brother’s heel: on this account he called him Jacob,
and him Esau. Now Isaac was sixty years old when he begat them.” If therefore when he
brought Rebecca home he was forty years old, and when he begat the sons sixty, it is very
plain that his wife had remained barren for twenty years between, and during all this time
Isaac continued to pray to God.</p>
<p>10. After this do we not feel shame, and hide our faces, at seeing that righteous man for
twenty years persevering790 and not desisting; we ourselves after a first or second petition
often fainting and indignant? And yet he indeed had in large measure liberty of speech towards
God,791 and all the same he felt no discontent at the delay of the giving, but remained

patient, whereas we, laden with countless sins, living with an evil conscience, displaying no
good will towards the Master; if we are not heard before having spoken, are bewildered,
impatiently recoil, desist from asking—on this account we always retire with empty hands.
Who has for twenty years besought God for one thing, as this righteous man did? or rather
who for twenty months only? Yesterday I was saying that they are many who pray with
slackness, and yawning, and stretching themselves, and continually shifting their attitude,
and indulging in every carelessness in their prayers—but to-day I have found also another
damage attaching itself to their prayers more destructive than that one. For many, throwing
themselves prostrate, and striking the ground with their forehead, and pouring forth hot
tears, and groaning bitterly from the heart792 and stretching out their hands, and displaying
much earnestness, employ this warmth and forwardness against their own salvation. For it
is not on behalf of their own sins that they beseech God; nor are they asking forgiveness of
the offences committed by them; but they are exerting this earnestness against their enemies
entirely, doing just the same thing as if one, after whetting his sword, were not to use the
weapon against his enemies, but to thrust it through his own throat. So these also use their
prayers not for the remission of their own sins, but about revenge on their enemies; which
is to thrust the sword against themselves. This too the wicked one has devised, in order that
on all sides we may destroy ourselves, both through slackness and through earnestness. For
the one class by their carelessness in their prayers exasperate God, by displaying contempt
through their slackness; and the others, when they display earnestness, display the earnestness
on the other hand against their own salvation. “A certain person,” he (the devil) says, “is
slack: that is sufficient for me with a view to his obtaining nothing; this man is earnest and
thoroughly aroused; what then must be done to accomplish the same result? I cannot
slacken his earnestness, nor throw him into carelessness; I will contrive his destruction in
the other way. How so? I will manage that he use his earnestness for transgressing the law:”
(for the praying against one’s personal enemies is a transgression of law). “He shall depart
therefore not only having gained nothing by his earnestness, but also having endured the
hurt which is greater than that caused through slackness.” Such as these are the injuries of
the devil: the one sort he destroys through their remissness; and the other through their
earnestness itself, when it is shown not according to God’s laws.</p>
<p>11. But it is also worth hearing the very words of their prayer, and how the words are
of a puerile mind; of how infantile a soul. I am ashamed in truth when about to repeat them;
but it is absolutely necessary to repeat them, and to imitate that coarse tongue. What then
are the words? “Avenge me of my enemies, show them that I too have God (on my side).”

They do not then learn, man, that we have God, when we are indignant and angry and impatient;
but when we are gentle and meek and subdued, and practise all love of wisdom. So
also God said, “Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and
glorify your Father who is in the heavens.”793 Perceivest thou not that it is an insult to God,
the making a request to God against thine enemies? And how is it an insult? one will say.
Because He Himself said, “pray for your enemies;” and brought in this divine law. When
therefore thou claimest that the legislator should relax his own laws; and callest upon him
to legislate in opposition to himself; and supplicatest him who had forbidden thee to pray
against thine enemies to hear thee praying against thine enemies; thou art not praying in
doing this, nor calling upon him; but thou art insulting the lawgiver, and acting with
drunken violence towards him, who is sure to give to thee the good things which result from
prayer. And how is it possible to be heard when praying, tell me, when thou exasperatest
him who is sure to hear? For by doing these things thou art pushing thine own salvation
into a pit, and art rushing down a precipice, by striking thine enemy before the king’s eyes.794
For even if thou doest not this with the hands, with thy words thou strikest him, the thing
which thou darest not do even in the case of thy fellow-slaves. At least dare to do this in a
ruler’s presence, and though thou hast done countless public services, thou wilt straightway
surely be led away to execution. Then (I ask) in the presence of a ruler dost thou not dare
to insult thine equal, but when doing this in God’s presence, tell me, dost thou not shudder,
nor fear when in the time of entreaty and prayer being so savage and turning thyself into a
wild beast; and displaying greater want of feeling than he who demanded payment of the
hundred pence?795 For that thou art more insolent than he, listen to the story itself. A certain
man owed ten thousand talents to his master; then, not having (wherewith) to pay, he entreated
him to be long-suffering, in order that, his wife having been sold and his house and
his children, he might settle his master’s claim. And the master seeing him lamenting had
compassion on him, and remitted the ten thousand talents. He having gone out and found
another servant owing him a hundred pence, seizing his throat demanded them with great
cruelty and inhumanity. The Master having heard this threw him into the prison, and laid
on him again the debt of the ten thousand talents which he had before remitted; and he paid
the penalty of the cruelty shown towards his fellow-servant.</p>
<p>12. Now do thou consider in how much more unfeeling and insensible in a way thou
hast acted even than he, praying against thine enemies. He did not beg his master to demand,
but he himself demanded, the hundred pence; whereas thou even callest on the Master for
this shameless and forbidden demand. And he seized his fellow-servant’s throat not before

<pb n="335"/>
his lord’s eyes, but outside; while thou in the very moment of prayer, standing in the King’s
presence, doest this. And if he, for doing this without either having urged his master to the
demand, and after going forth, met with no forgiveness; thou, both stirring up the Master
to (exacting) this forbidden payment, and doing this before his eyes, what sort of penalty
will thou have to pay? tell me. But thy mind is inflamed by the memory of the enmity, and
swells, and thy heart rises,796 and when recurring in memory to him who has caused pain,
thou art unable to reduce the swelling of thy thought. But set against this inflammation the
memory resulting from thine own sins committed the fear resulting from the punishment
to come. Recall to memory for how many things thou art accountable to thy master, and
that for all those things thou owest Him satisfaction; and this fear will surely overcome that
anger; since indeed this is far more powerful than that passion. Recall the memory of hell
and punishment and vengeance during the time of thy prayer; and thou wilt not be able
even to receive thine enemy into thy mind.797 Make thy mind contrite, humble thy soul by
the memory of the offences committed by thee, and wrath will not be able even to trouble
thee. But the cause of all these evils is this, that we scrutinise the sins of all others with great
exactitude; while we let our own pass with great remissness. Whereas we ought to do the
contrary—to keep our own faults unforgotten; but never even to admit a thought of those
of others. If we do this we shall both have God propitious, and shall cease cherishing immortal
anger against our neighbours, and we shall never have any one as an enemy; and even if we
should have at any time we shall both quickly put an end to his enmity, and should obtain
speedy pardon for our own sins. For just as he who treasures up the memory of wrong
against his neighbour does not permit the punishment upon his own sins to be done away;
so he who is clear of anger will speedily be clear of sins also. For if we, wicked as we are and
enslaved to passion, on account of the commandment of God overlook all the faults committed
against us, much more will He who is a lover of mankind, and good, and free from
any passion, overlook our delinquencies, rendering to us the recompense of our kindly
spirit towards our neighbour in the forgiveness of our own sins: which God grant that we
may attain, by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory
and the dominion, to the ages of the ages. Amen.</p>

<head>INTRODUCTION TO THE TWO HOMILIES ON EUTROPIUS.</head>
<p>The interest of the two following discourses depends not only on their intrinsic value
as specimens of Chrysostom’s eloquence, but also on the singular and dramatic character
of the incidents which gave occasion to them.</p>
<p>Arcadius the Emperor of the East like his brother Honorius the Emperor of the West
was a man of feeble intellect. The history of the Empire under his reign is a melancholy record
of imbecility on the part of the nominal rulers: of faithlessness and unscrupulous ambition
on the part of their ministers. The chief administrator of affairs in the beginning of the reign
of Arcadius was Rufinus, an Aquitanian Gaul; the very model of an accomplished adventurer.
His intrigues, his arrogance, his rapacious avarice excited the indignation of the people, and
he was at last assassinated by the troops to whom he was making an oration in the presence
of the Emperor. His place in the favour and confidence of Arcadius was soon occupied by
the eunuch Eutropius. The career of this person was a strange one. Born a slave, in the region
of Mesopotamia, he had passed in boyhood and youth through the hands of many owners,
performing the most menial offices incident to his position. At length Arnithus, an old
military officer who had become his master, presented him to his daughter on her marriage;
and in the words of the poet Claudian, “the future consul of the East was made over as part
of a marriage dowry.”798 But the young lady after a time grew tired of the slave who was
becoming elderly and wrinkled, and without trying to sell him turned him out of her
household. He picked up a precarious living in Constantinople and was often in great want
until an officer of the court took pity on him, and procured him a situation in the lower
ranks of the imperial chamberlains. This was the beginning of his rise. By the diligence with
which he discharged his humble duties, by occasional witty sayings, and the semblance of
a fervent piety he attracted the notice of the great Emperor Theodosius (the father of Arcadius),
and gradually won his confidence so as to be employed on difficult and delicate missions.
On the death of Theodosius he became in the capacity of grand chamberlain the intimate
adviser and constant attendant of Arcadius and the most subtle and determined rival
of Rufinus. It was by his contrivance that the scheme of Rufinus for marrying his own
daughter to the Emperor was defeated: and that Eudoxia the daughter of a Frankish general
was substituted for her. After the murder of Rufinus the government was practically in his
hands; but he exercised his power more craftily than the vain and boastful Gaul. He contrived
at first to discharge all the duties which fell to his lot as chamberlain with humble assiduity,
and sought no other title than he already possessed. Slowly but surely however he climbed
to the summit of power by the simple process of putting out of the way on various pretexts
all dangerous competitors. He deprived his victims of their last hope of escape by abolishing
the right of the Church to afford shelter to fugitives. He sold the chief offices of the State,
<note type="footnote">798 In Eutrop. i. 104, 105.</note>

<pb n="338"/>
and the command of the provinces to the highest bidders. By surrounding the Emperor
with a crowd of frivolous companions, by dissipating his mind with a perpetual round of
amusements, by taking him every spring to Ancyra in Phrygia where he was subjected to
the enervating influence of a soft climate and luxurious style of living he made the naturally
feeble intellect of Arcadius more feeble still and withdrew it from the power of every superior
mind but his own. From the pettiest detail of domestic life to the most important affairs
of state, the wily minister at length ruled supreme. Arcadius was little more than a magnificently
dressed puppet, and the eunuch slave was the real master of half the Roman world.
It was by his advice that on the death of Nectarius in 397 that Chrysostom had been appointed,
very much against his own will, to the vacant See of Constantinople. If Eutropius expected
to find a complaisant courtier in the new Archbishop he certainly sustained a severe disappointment.
Some little pretences which he made of assisting the work of the Church by
patronising Chrysostom’s missionary projects could not blind the Archbishop to the gross
venality of his administration, or exempt him from the censure and warning of one who
was too honest and bold to be any respecter of persons. In fact when the Archbishop declaimed
against the cupidity and oppressions of the rich it was obvious to all that Eutropius
was the most signal example of these vices. At last the minister, not content to remain as he
was—enjoying the reality of power without the name—prepared the way for his own ruin
by inducing the Emperor to bestow on him the titles of Patrician and Consul. The acquisition
of these venerable names by the eunuch slave caused a profound sensation of shame and
indignation throughout the Empire, but especially in the Western capital, where they were
bound up with all the noblest and most glorious memories in the history of the Roman
people. The name of Eutropius was omitted from the Fasti or catalogue of consuls inscribed
in the Capitol at Rome. Amidst the general decadence and degeneracy of public spirit in
the Empire the West did not descend, could not have descended, to those depths of servile
adulation to which the Byzantines stooped at the inauguration of Eutropius as Consul. The
senate, and all the great officials military and civil poured into the palace of the Cæsars to
offer their homage, and emulated each other in the honor of kissing the hand and even the
wrinkled visage of the eunuch. They saluted him as the bulwark of the laws, and the second
father of the Emperor. Statues of bronze or marble were placed in various parts of the city
representing him in the costume of warrior or judge, and the inscriptions on them styled
him third founder of the city, after Byzas, and Constantine. No wonder that Claudian declaimed
with bitter sarcasm against “a Byzantine nobility and Greek divinities” and invokes
Neptune by a stroke of his trident to unseat and submerge the degenerate city which had
inflicted such a deep disgrace on the Empire.799 A blow indeed was about to fall upon the
eastern capital, directed not by the hand of a mythic deity, but of a stout barbarian soldier.
<note type="footnote">799 In Eutrop. ii. 39, 136.</note>

<pb n="339"/>
The consequences of it were averted from the city only by the sacrifice of the new consul
upon whom it fell with crushing effect. He sank never to rise again. Tribigild, a distinguished
gothic soldier who had been raised to the rank of Tribune in the Roman army, had demanded
higher promotion for himself and higher pay for a body of military colonists in Phrygia of
which he had the command. His petition had been coldly dismissed by Eutropius; Tribigild
resent the affront and with the troops which he commanded broke into revolt. Eutropius
entrusted the conduct of an expedition against him to one of his favorites, who suffered a
most ignominious defeat in which he perished, and the greater part of his army was cut to
pieces. Constantinople was convulsed with terror and indignation. Gäinas another Goth in
command of the city troops declared that he could do nothing to check the progress of the
revolt unless Eutropius was banished, the principal author of all the evils of the State. His
demand was backed by the Empress Eudoxia, who had experienced much insolence from
the minister. Eutropius was deprived of his official dignity, his property was declared confiscated,
and he was commanded to quit the palace instantly under pain of death. Whither
could the poor wretch fly who was thus in a moment hurled from the pinnacle of power
into the lowest depths of degradation and destitution. There was but one place to which he
could naturally turn in his distress—the sanctuary of the Church; but by the cruel irony of
his fate, a law of his own devising here barred his entrance. Yet he knew that the law prohibiting
asylum had been resented and resisted by the Church and it might be that the Archbishop
would connive at the violation of the obnoxious measure by the very person who
had passed it. He resolved to make the experiment. In the humblest guise of a suppliant,
tears streaming down his puckered cheeks, his scant grey hairs smeared with dust, he crept
into the Cathedral, drew aside the curtain in front of the altar and clung to one of the columns
which supported it. Here he was found by Chrysostom in a state of pitiable and abject terror,
for soldiers in search of him had entered the Church, and the clattering of their arms could
be heard on the other side of the thin partition which concealed the fugitive. With quivering
lips he craved the asylum of the church, and he was not repulsed as the destroyer of the
refuge which he now sought.800 Chrysostom rejoiced in the opportunity afforded to the
church of taking a noble revenge on her adversary.801 He concealed Eutropius in the sacristy,
confronted his pursuers, and refused to surrender him. “None shall violate the sanctuary
save over my body: the church is the bride of Christ who has entrusted her honor to me and
I will never betray it.” He desired to be conducted to the Emperor and taken like a prisoner
between two rows of spearmen from the Cathedral to the palace802 where he boldly vindicated
the church’s right of asylum in the presence of the Emperor. Arcadius promised to respect

the retreat of the fallen minister, and with difficulty persuaded the angry troops to accept
his decision. The next day was Sunday, and the Cathedral was thronged with a vast multitude
eager to hear what the golden mouth of the Archbishop would utter who had dared in defence
of the Church’s right to defy the law, and confront the tide of popular feeling. But few
probably were prepared to witness such a dramatic scene as was actually presented. The
Archbishop had just taken his seat in the “Ambon” or high reading desk a little westward
of the chancel from which he was wont to preach on the account of his diminutive stature,
and a sea of faces was upturned to him waiting for the stream of golden eloquence when
the curtain of the sanctuary was drawn aside and disclosed the cowering form of the
miserable Eutropius clinging to one of the columns of the Holy Table. Many a time had the
Archbishop preached to unheeding ears on the vain and fleeting character of worldly honor,
prosperity, luxury, and wealth: now he would force attention, and drive home his lesson to
the hearts of his vast congregation by pointing to a visible example of fallen grandeur in the
poor wretch who lay grovelling behind him.</p>
<p>Eutropius remained for some days within the precincts of the Church and then suddenly
departed. Whether he mistrusted the security of his shelter and hoped to make his escape
in disguise, or whether he surrendered himself on the understanding that exile would be
substituted for capital punishment cannot be certainly known. Chrysostom declared that
if he had not abandoned the Church, the Church would never have given him up.803 Anyhow
he was captured and conveyed to Cyprus, but soon afterwards he was tried at Constantinople
on various charges of high crimes and misdemeanors against the State, and condemned to
suffer capital punishment. He was taken to Chalcedon and there beheaded.804 The second
of the two following discourses was delivered a few days after Eutropius had quitted the
sanctuary of the Church.</p>

<head>EUTROPIUS, PATRICIAN AND CONSUL.</head>

<head>Homily I.</head>
<p>On Eutropius, the eunuch, Patrician and Consul.</p>
<p>1. “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity”—it is always seasonable to utter this but more especially
at the present time. Where are now the brilliant surroundings of thy consulship? where
are the gleaming torches? Where is the dancing, and the noise of dancers’ feet, and the
banquets and the festivals? where are the garlands and the curtains of the theatre? where is
the applause which greeted thee in the city, where the acclamation in the hippodrome and
the flatteries of spectators? They are gone—all gone: a wind has blown upon the tree shattering
down all its leaves, and showing it to us quite bare, and shaken from its very root; for
so great has been the violence of the blast, that it has given a shock to all these fibres of the
tree and threatens to tear it up from the roots. Where now are your feigned friends? where
are your drinking parties, and your suppers? where is the swarm of parasites, and the wine
which used to be poured forth all day long, and the manifold dainties invented by your
cooks? where are they who courted your power and did and said everything to win your
favour? They were all mere visions of the night, and dreams which have vanished with the
dawn of day: they were spring flowers, and when the spring was over they all withered: they
were a shadow which has passed away—they were a smoke which has dispersed, bubbles
which have burst, cobwebs which have been rent in pieces. Therefore we chant continually
this spiritual song—“Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.” For this saying ought to be continually
written on our walls, and garments, in the market place, and in the house, on the streets,
and on the doors and entrances, and above all on the conscience of each one, and to be a
perpetual theme for meditation. And inasmuch as deceitful things, and maskings and pretence
seem to many to be realities it behoves each one every day both at supper and at breakfast,
and in social assemblies to say to his neighbour and to hear his neighbour say in return
“vanity of vanities, all is vanity.” Was I not continually telling thee that wealth was a runaway?
But you would not heed me. Did I not tell thee that it was an unthankful servant? But you
would not be persuaded. Behold actual experience has now proved that it is not only a
runaway, and ungrateful servant, but also a murderous one, for it is this which has caused
thee now to fear and tremble. Did I not say to thee when you continually rebuked me for
speaking the truth, “I love thee better than they do who flatter thee?” “I who reprove thee
care more for thee than they who pay thee court?” Did I not add to these words by saying
that the wounds of friends were more to be relied upon than the voluntary kisses of en-

<pb n="342"/>
emies.805 If you had submitted to my wounds their kisses would not have wrought thee this
destruction: for my wounds work health, but their kisses have produced an incurable disease.
Where are now thy cup-bearers, where are they who cleared the way for thee in the market
place, and sounded thy praises endlessly in the ears of all? They have fled, they have disowned
thy friendship, they are providing for their own safety by means of thy distress. But I do not
act thus, nay in thy misfortune I do not abandon thee, and now when thou art fallen I protect
and tend thee. And the Church which you treated as an enemy has opened her bosom and
received thee into it; whereas the theatres which you courted, and about which you were
oftentimes indignant with me have betrayed and ruined thee. And yet I never ceased saying
to thee “why doest thou these things?” “thou art exasperating the Church, and casting thyself
down headlong,” yet thou didst hurry away from all my warnings. And now the hippodromes,
having exhausted thy wealth, have whetted the sword against thee, but the Church which
experienced thy untimely wrath is hurrying in every direction, in her desire to pluck thee
out of the net.</p>
<p>2. And I say these things now not as trampling upon one who is prostrate, but from a
desire to make those who are still standing more secure; not by way of irritating the sores
of one who has been wounded, but rather to preserve those who have not yet been wounded
in sound health; not by way of sinking one who is tossed by the waves, but as instructing
those who are sailing with a favourable breeze, so that they may not become overwhelmed.
And how may this be effected? by observing the vicissitudes of human affairs. For even this
man had he stood in fear of vicissitude would not have experienced it; but whereas neither
his own conscience, nor the counsels of others wrought any improvement in him, do ye at
least who plume yourselves on your riches profit by his calamity: for nothing is weaker than
human affairs. Whatever term therefore one may employ to express their insignificance it
will fall short of the reality; whether he calls them smoke, or grass, or a dream or spring
flowers, or by any other name; so perishable are they, and more naught than nonentities;806
but that together with their nothingness they have also a very perilous element we have a
proof before us. For who was more exalted than this man? Did he not surpass the whole
world in wealth? had he not climbed to the very pinnacle of distinction? did not all tremble
and fear before him? Yet lo! he has become more wretched than the prisoner, more pitiable
than the menial slave, more indigent than the beggar wasting away with hunger, having
every day a vision of sharpened swords and of the criminal’s grave, and the public executioner
leading him out to his death; and he does not even know if he once enjoyed past pleasure,
nor is he sensible even of the sun’s ray, but at mid day his sight is dimmed as if he were encompassed
by the densest gloom. But even let me try my best I shall not be able to present
<note type="footnote">805 Prov. xxvii. 6.</note>
<note type="footnote">806 τῶν οὐδεν ὀντων οὐδαμινώτερα.</note>

<pb n="343"/>
to you in language the suffering which he must naturally undergo, in the hourly expectation
of death. But indeed what need is there of any words from me, when he himself has clearly
depicted this for us as in a visible image? For yesterday when they came to him from the
royal court intending to drag him away by force, and he ran for refuge to the holy furniture,
807 his face was then, as it is now, no better than the countenance of one dead: and
the chattering of his teeth, and the quaking and quivering of his whole body, and his faltering
voice, and stammering tongue, and in fact his whole general appearance were suggestive of
one whose soul was petrified.</p>
<p>3. Now I say these things not by way of reproaching him, or insulting his misfortune,
but from a desire to soften your minds towards him, and to induce you to compassion, and
to persuade you to be contented with the punishment which has already been inflicted. For
since there are many inhuman persons amongst us who are inclined, perhaps, to find fault
with me for having admitted him to the sanctuary, I parade his sufferings from a desire to
soften their hardheartedness by my narrative.</p>
<p>For tell me, beloved brother, wherefore art thou indignant with me? You say it is because
he who continually made war upon the Church has taken refuge within it. Yet surely we
ought in the highest degree to glorify God, for permitting him to be placed in such a great
strait as to experience both the power and the lovingkindness of the Church:—her power
in that he has suffered this great vicissitude in consequence of the attacks which he made
upon her: her lovingkindness in that she whom he attacked now casts her shield in front of
him and has received him under her wings, and placed him in all security not resenting any
of her former injuries, but most lovingly opening her bosom to him. For this is more glorious
than any kind of trophy, this is a brilliant victory, this puts both Gentiles and Jews to shame,
this displays the bright aspect of the Church: in that having received her enemy as a captive,
she spares him, and when all have despised him in his desolation, she alone like an affectionate
mother has concealed him under her cloak,808 opposing both the wrath of the king, and
the rage of the people, and their overwhelming hatred. This is an ornament for the altar. A
strange kind of ornament, you say, when the accused sinner, the extortioner, the robber is
permitted to lay hold of the altar. Nay! say not so: for even the harlot took hold of the feet
of Jesus, she who was stained with the most accursed and unclean sin: yet her deed was no
reproach to Jesus, but rather redounded to His admiration and praise: for the impure woman
did no injury to Him who was pure, but rather was the vile harlot rendered pure by the
touch of Him who was the pure and spotless one. Grudge not then, O man. We are the servants
of the crucified one who said “Forgive them for they know not what they do.”809 But,
<note type="footnote">807 Holy vessels would be the literal rendering of the word (σκ™υεσι), but it is clear from what follows that
the altar is intended.</note>
<note type="footnote">808 Possibly an allusion to the curtain which in Eastern Churches, was drawn in front of the altar.</note>
<note type="footnote">809 Luke xxiii. 34.</note>

<pb n="344"/>
you say, he cut off the right of refuge here by his ordinances and divers kinds of laws. Yes!
yet now he has learned by experience what it was he did, and he himself by his own deeds
has been the first to break the law, and has become a spectacle to the whole world, and silent
though he is, he utters from thence a warning voice to all, saying “do not such things as I
have done, that ye suffer not such things as I suffer.” He appears as a teacher by means of
his calamity, and the altar emits great lustre, inspiring now the greatest awe from the fact
that it holds the lion in bondage; for any figure of royalty might be very much set off if the
king were not only to be seen seated on his throne arrayed in purple and wearing his crown,
but if also prostrate at the feet of the king barbarians with their hands bound behind their
backs were bending low their heads. And that no persuasive arguments have been used, ye
yourselves are witnesses of the enthusiasm, and the concourse of the people. For brilliant
indeed is the scene before us to day, and magnificent the assembly, and I see as large a
gathering here to-day as at the Holy Paschal Feast. Thus the man has summoned you here
without speaking and yet uttering a voice through his actions clearer than the sound of a
trumpet: and ye have all thronged hither to-day, maidens deserting their boudoirs, and
matrons the women’s chambers, and men the market place that ye may see human nature
convicted, and the instability of worldly affairs exposed, and the harlot-face which a few
days ago was radiant (such is the prosperity derived from extortion) looking uglier than any
wrinkled old woman, this face I say you may see denuded of its enamel and pigments by
the action of adversity as by a sponge.</p>
<p>4. Such is the force of this calamity: it has made one who was illustrious and conspicuous
appear the most insignificant of men. And if a rich man should enter the assembly he derives
much profit from the sight: for when he beholds the man who was shaking the whole world,
now dragged down from so high a pinnacle of power, cowering with fright, more terrified
than a hare or a frog, nailed fast to yonder pillar, without bonds, his fear serving instead of
a chain, panic-stricken and trembling, he abates his haughtiness, he puts down his pride,
and having acquired the kind of wisdom concerning human affairs which it concerns him
to have he departs instructed by example in the lesson which Holy Scripture teaches by
precept:—“All flesh is grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass: the grass withereth
and the flower faileth”810 or “They shall wither away quickly as the grass, and as the green
herb shall they quickly fail”811 or “like smoke are his days,”812 and all passages of that kind.
Again the poor man when he has entered and gazed at this spectacle does not think meanly
of himself, nor bewail himself on account of his poverty, but feels grateful to his poverty,
because it is a place of refuge to him, and a calm haven, and secure bulwark; and when he

<pb n="345"/>
sees these things he would many times rather remain where he is, than enjoy the possession
of all men for a little time and afterwards be in jeopardy of his own life. Seest thou how the
rich and poor, high and low, bond and free have derived no small profit from this man’s
taking refuge here? Seest thou how each man will depart hence with a remedy, being cured
merely by this sight? Well! have I softened your passion, and expelled your wrath? have I
extinguished your cruelty? have I induced you to be pitiful? Indeed I think I have; and your
countenances and the streams of tears you shed are proofs of it. Since then your hard rock
has turned into deep and fertile soil let us hasten to produce some fruit of mercy, and to
display a luxuriant crop of pity by falling down before the Emperor or rather by imploring
the merciful God so to soften the rage of the Emperor, and make his heart tender that he
may grant the whole of the favour which we ask. For indeed already since that day when
this man fled here for refuge no slight change has taken place; for as soon as the Emperor
knew that he had hurried to this asylum, although the army was present, and incensed on
account of his misdeeds, and demanded him to be given up for execution, the Emperor
made a long speech endeavouring to allay the rage of the soldiers, maintaining that not only
his offences, but any good deed which he might have done ought to be taken into account,
declaring that he felt gratitude for the latter, and was prepared to forgive him as a fellow
creature for deeds which were otherwise. And when they again urged him to avenge the
insult done to the imperial majesty, shouting, leaping, and brandishing their spears, he shed
streams of tears from his gentle eyes, and having reminded them of the Holy Table to which
the man had fled for refuge he succeeded at last in appeasing their wrath.</p>
<p>5. Moreover let me add some arguments which concern ourselves. For what pardon
could you deserve, if the Emperor bears no resentment when he has been insulted, but ye
who have experienced nothing of this kind display so much wrath? and how after this assembly
has been dissolved will ye handle the holy mysteries, and repeat that prayer by which
we are commanded to say “forgive us as we also forgive our debtors”813 when ye are demanding
vengeance upon your debtor? Has he inflicted great wrongs and insults on you? I will
not deny it. Yet this is the season not for judgment but for mercy; not for requiring an account,
but for showing loving kindness: not for investigating claims but for conceding them;
not for verdicts and vengeance, but for mercy and favour. Let no one then be irritated or
vexed, but let us rather beseech the merciful God to grant him a respite from death, and to
rescue him from this impending destruction, so that he may put off his transgression, and
let us unite to approach the merciful Emperor beseeching him for the sake of the Church,
for the sake of the altar, to concede the life of one man as an offering to the Holy Table. If
we do this the Emperor himself will accept us, and even before his praise we shall have the
approval of God, who will bestow a large recompense upon us for our mercy. For as he rejects
<note type="footnote">813 Matt. vi. 12.</note>

<pb n="346"/>
and hates the cruel and inhuman, so does He welcome and love the merciful and humane
man; and if such a man be righteous, all the more glorious is the crown which is wreathed
for him: and if he be a sinner, He passes over his sins granting this as the reward of compassion
shown to his fellow-servant. “For” He saith “I will have mercy and not sacrifice,”814
and throughout the Scriptures you find Him always enquiring after this, and declaring it to
be the means of release from sin. Thus then we shall dispose Him to be propitious to us,
thus we shall release ourselves from our sins, thus we shall adorn the Church, thus also our
merciful Emperor, as I have already said, will commend us, and all the people will applaud
us, and the ends of the earth will admire the humanity and gentleness of our city, and all
who hear of these deeds throughout the world will extol us. That we then may enjoy these
good things, let us fall down in prayer and supplication, let us rescue the captive, the fugitive,
the suppliant from danger that we ourselves may obtain the future blessings by the favour
and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory and power, now and for ever, world
without end. Amen.</p>

<p>After Eutropius having been found outside the Church had been taken captive.</p>
<p>1. Delectable indeed are the meadow, and the garden, but far more delectable the study
of the divine writings. For there indeed are flowers which fade, but here are thoughts which
abide in full bloom; there is the breeze of the zephyr, but here the breath of the Spirit: there
is the hedge of thorns, but here is the guarding providence of God; there is the song of cicadæ,
but here the melody of the prophets: there is the pleasure which comes from sight, but here
the profit which comes from study. The garden is confined to one place, but the Scriptures
are in all parts of the world; the garden is subject to the necessities of the seasons, but the
Scriptures are rich in foliage, and laden with fruit alike in winter and in summer. Let us then
give diligent heed to the study of the Scriptures: for if thou doest this the Scripture will expel
thy despondency, and engender pleasure, extirpate vice, and make virtue take root, and in
the tumult of life it will save thee from suffering like those who are tossed by troubled waves.
The sea rages but thou sailest on with calm weather; for thou hast the study of the Scriptures
for thy pilot; for this is the cable which the trials of life do not break asunder. Now that I lie
not events themselves bear witness. A few days ago the Church was besieged: an army came,
and fire issued from their eyes, yet it did not scorch the olive tree; swords were unsheathed,
yet no one received a wound; the imperial gates were in distress, but the Church was in se-
curity. And yet the tide of war flowed hither; for here the refugee was sought, and we withstood
them, not fearing their rage. And wherefore prithee? because we held as a sure pledge
the saying “Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church: and the gates of hell
shall not prevail against it.”815 And when I say the Church I mean not only a place but also
a plan of life:816 I mean not the walls of the Church but the laws of the Church. When thou
takest refuge in a Church, do not seek shelter merely in the place but in the spirit of the
place. For the Church is not wall and roof but faith and life.</p>
<p>Do not tell me that the man having been surrendered was surrendered by the Church;
if he had not abandoned the Church he would not have been surrendered. Do not say that
he fled here for refuge and then was given up: the Church did not abandon him but he
abandoned the Church. He was not surrendered from within the Church but outside its
walls. Wherefore did he forsake the Church? Didst thou desire to save thyself? Thou shouldst
have held fast to the altar. There were no walls here, but there was the guarding providence
of God. Wast thou a sinner? God does not reject thee: for “He came not to call the righteous
but sinners to repentance.”817 The harlot was saved when she clung to His feet. Have ye
<note type="footnote">815 Matt. xvi. 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">816 ὀυ τόπον μὀνον ‡λλὰ καὶ τρόπον.</note>
<note type="footnote">817 Matt. ix. 13.</note>

<pb n="348"/>
heard the passage read to-day? Now I say these things that thou mayest not hesitate to take
refuge in the Church. Abide with the Church, and the Church does not hand thee over to
the enemy: but if thou fliest from the Church, the Church is not the cause of thy capture.
For if thou art inside the fold the wolf does not enter: but if thou goest outside, thou art liable
to be the wild beast’s prey: yet this is not the fault of the fold, but of thy own pusillanimity.
The Church hath no feet. Talk not to me of walls and arms: for walls wax old with time, but
the Church has no old age. Walls are shattered by barbarians, but over the Church even
demons do not prevail. And that my words are no mere vaunt there is the evidence of facts.
How many have assailed the Church, and yet the assailants have perished while the Church
herself has soared beyond the sky? Such might hath the Church: when she is assailed she
conquers: when snares are laid for her she prevails: when she is insulted her prosperity increases:
she is wounded yet sinks not under her wounds; tossed by waves yet not submerged;
vexed by storms yet suffers no shipwreck; she wrestles and is not worsted, fights but is not
vanquished. Wherefore then did she suffer this war to be? That she might make more
manifest the splendour of her triumph. Ye were present on that day, and ye saw what weapons
were set in motion against her, and how the rage of the soldiers burned more fiercely than
fire, and I was hurried away to the imperial palace.818 But what of that? By the grace of God
none of those things dismayed me.</p>
<p>2. Now I say these things in order that ye too may follow my example. But wherefore
was I not dismayed? Because I do not fear any present terrors. For what is terrible? Death?
nay this is not terrible: for we speedily reach the unruffled haven. Or spoliation of goods?
“Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I depart;”819 or exile? “The earth
is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof;”820 or false accusation? “Rejoice and be exceeding glad,
when men shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for great is your reward in Heaven.”
821 I saw the swords and I meditated on Heaven; I expected death, and I bethought me
of the resurrection; I beheld the sufferings of this lower world, and I took account of the
heavenly prizes; I observed the devices of the enemy, and I meditated on the heavenly crown:
for the occasion of the contest was sufficient for encouragement and consolation. True! I
was being forcibly dragged away, but I suffered no insult from the act; for there is only one
real insult, namely sin: and should the whole world insult thee, yet if thou dost not insult
thyself thou art not insulted. The only real betrayal is the betrayal of the conscience: betray
not thy own conscience, and no one can betray thee. I was being dragged away and I saw
the events—or rather I saw my words turned into events, I saw my discourse which I had

uttered in words being preached in the market-place through the medium of actual events.
What kind of discourse? the same which I was always repeating. The wind has blown and
the leaves have fallen. “The grass has withered and the flower has faded.”822 The night has
departed and the day has dawned; the shadow has been proved vain and the truth has appeared.
They mounted up to the sky, and they came down to the level of earth: for the waves
which were swelling high have been laid low by means of merely human events. How? The
things which were taking place were a lesson. And I said to myself will posterity learn selfcontrol?
or before two days have passed by will these events have been abandoned to oblivion?
The warnings were sounding in their ears. Again let me utter, yet again I will speak. What
profit will there be? Certainly there will be profit. For if all do not hearken, the half will
hearken; and if not the half, the third part: and if not the third the fourth: and if not the
fourth, perhaps ten: and if not ten, perhaps five: and if not five perhaps one: and if not one,
I myself have the reward prepared for me. “The grass withereth and the flower fadeth; but
the word of God abideth for ever.”823</p>
<p>3. Have ye seen the insignificance of human affairs? have ye seen the frailty of power?
Have ye seen the wealth which I always called a runaway and not a runaway only, but also
a murderer. For it not only deserts those who possess it, but also slaughters them; for when
any one pays court to it then most of all does it betray him. Why dost thou pay court to
wealth which to-day is for thee, and to-morrow for another? Why dost thou court wealth
which can never be held fast? Dost thou desire to court it? dost thou desire to hold it fast?
Do not bury it but give it into the hands of the poor. For wealth is a wild beast: if it be tightly
held it runs away: if it be let loose it remains where it is; “For,” it is said, “he hath dispersed
abroad and given to the poor; his righteousness remaineth forever.”824 Disperse it then that
it may remain with thee; bury it not lest it run away. Where is wealth? I would gladly enquire
of those who have departed. Now I say these things not by way of reproach, God forbid, nor
by way of irritating old sores, but as endeavouring to secure a haven for you out of the
shipwreck of others. When soldiers and swords were threatening, when the city was in a
blaze of fury, when the imperial majesty was powerless, and the purple was insulted, when
all places were full of frenzy, where was wealth then? where was your silver plate? where
were your silver couches? where your household slaves? they had all betaken themselves to
flight; where were the eunuchs? they all ran away; where were your friends? they changed
their masks. Where were your houses? they were shut up. Where was your money? the
owner of it fled: and the money itself, where was that? it was buried. Where was it all hidden?
Am I oppressive and irksome to you in constantly declaring that wealth betrays those who

<pb n="350"/>
use it badly? The occasion has now come which proves the truth of my words. Why dost
thou hold it so tightly, when in the time of trial it profiteth thee nothing? If it has power
when thou fallest into a strait, let it come to thy aid, but if it then runs away what need hast
thou of it? events themselves bear witness. What profit was there in it? The sword was
whetted, death was impending, an army raging: there was apprehension of imminent peril;
and yet wealth was nowhere to be seen. Where did the runaway flee? It was itself the cause
which brought about all these evils, and yet in the hours of necessity it runs away. Nevertheless
many reproach me saying continually thou fasteneth upon the rich: while they on the
other hand fasten upon the poor. Well I do fasten upon the rich: or rather not the rich, but
those who make a bad use of their riches. For I am continually saying that I do not attack
the character of the rich man, but of the rapacious. A rich man is one thing, a rapacious
man is another: an affluent man is one thing, a covetous man is another. Make clear distinctions,
and do not confuse things which are diverse. Art thou a rich man? I forbid thee not.
Art thou a rapacious man? I denounce thee. Hast thou property of thy own? enjoy it. Dost
thou take the property of others? I will not hold my peace. Wouldest thou stone me for this?
I am ready to shed my blood: only I forbid thy sin. I heed not hatred, I heed not war: one
thing only do I heed, the advancement of my hearers. The rich are my children, and the
poor also are my children: the same womb has travailed with both, both are the offspring
of the same travail-pangs. If then thou fastenest reproaches on the poor man, I denounce
thee: for the poor man does not suffer so much loss as the rich. For no great wrong is inflicted
on the poor man, seeing that in his case the injury is confined to money; but in thy case the
injury touches the soul. Let him who wills cast me off, let him who wills stone me, let him
who wills hate me: for the plots of enemies are the pledges to me of crowns of victory, and
the number of my rewards will be as the number of my wounds.</p>
<p>4. So then I fear not an enemy’s plots: one thing only do I fear, which is sin. If no one
convicts me of sin, then let the whole world make war upon me. For this kind of war only
renders me more prosperous. Thus also do I wish to teach you a lesson. Fear not the devices
of a potentate, but fear the power of sin. No man will do thee harm, if thou dost not deal a
blow to thyself. If thou hast not sin, ten thousand swords may threaten thee, but God will
snatch thee away out of their reach: but if thou hast sin, even shouldest thou be in paradise
thou wilt be cast out. Adam was in paradise yet he fell; Job was on a dung hill, yet he was
crowned victorious. What profit was paradise to the one? or what injury was the dung hill
to the other? No man laid snares for the one, yet was he overthrown: the devil laid snares
for the other, and yet he was crowned. Did not the devil take his property? Yes, but he did
not rob him of his godliness. Did he not lay violent hands upon his sons? yes: but he did
not shake his faith. Did he not tear his body to pieces? yes but he did not find his treasure.
Did he not arm his wife against him? yes but he did not overthrow the soldier. Did he not
hurl arrows and darts at him? yes but he received no wounds. He advanced his engines but

<pb n="351"/>
could not shake the tower; he conducted his billows against him, but did not sink the ship.
Observe this law I beseech you, yea I clasp your knees, if not with the bodily hand, yet in
spirit, and pour forth tears of supplication. Observe this law I pray you, and no one can do
you harm. Never call the rich man happy; never call any man miserable save him who is
living in sin: and call him happy who lives in righteousness. For it is not the nature of their
circumstances, but the disposition of the men which makes both the one and the other.
Never be afraid of the sword if thy conscience does not accuse thee: never be afraid in war
if thy conscience is clear. Where are they who have departed? tell me. Did not all men once
bow down to them? did not those who were in authority tremble greatly before them? did
they not pay court to them? But sin has come, and all things are manifested in their true
lights; they who were attendants have become judges, the flatterers are turned into executioners;
they who once kissed his hands, dragged him themselves from the church, and he
who yesterday kissed his hand is to-day his enemy. Wherefore? Because neither did he yesterday
love him with sincerity. For the opportunity came and the actors were unmasked.
Didst thou not yesterday kiss his hands, and call him saviour, and guardian, and benefactor?
Didst thou not compose panegyrics without end? wherefore to-day dost thou accuse him?
Why yesterday a praiser, and to-day an accuser? why yesterday utter panegyrics, and to-day
reproaches? What means this change? what means this revolution?</p>
<p>5. But I am not like this: I was the subject of his plots, yet I became his protector. I
suffered countless troubles at his hands, yet I did not retaliate. For I copy the example of
my Master, who said on the cross, “Forgive them, for they know not what they do.” Now I
say these things that you may not be perverted by the suspicion of wicked men. Now many
changes have taken place, since I had the oversight of the city, and yet no one learns selfcontrol?
But when I say no one, I do not condemn all, God forbid. For it is impossible that
this rich soil when it has received seed, should not produce one ear of corn: but I am insatiable,
I do not wish many to be saved but all. And if but one be left in a perishing condition,
I perish also, and deem that the Shepherd should be imitated who had ninety-nine sheep,
and yet hastened after the one which had gone astray.825 How long will money last? how
long this silver and gold? how long these draughts of wine? how long the flatteries of slaves?
how long these goblets wreathed with garlands? how long these satanic drinking feasts, full
of diabolical activity?</p>
<p>Dost thou not know that the present life is a sojourn in a far country? for art thou a
citizen? Nay thou art a wayfarer. Understandest thou what I say? Thou art not a citizen, but
thou art a wayfarer, and a traveller. Say not: I have this city and that. No one has a city. The
city is above. Present life is but a journey. We are journeying on every day, while nature is
running its course. Some there are who store up goods on the way: some who bury jewellery
<note type="footnote">825 Luke xv. 4.</note>

<pb n="352"/>
on the road. Now when you enter an inn do you beautify the inn? not so, but you eat and
drink and hasten to depart. The present life is an inn: we have entered it, and we bring
present life to a close: let us be eager to depart with a good hope, let us leave nothing here,
that we may not lose it there. When you enter the inn, what do you say to the servant? Take
care where you put away our things, that you do not leave anything behind here, that
nothing may be lost, not even what is small and trifling, in order that we may carry everything
back to our home. Thou art a wayfarer and traveller, and indeed more insignificant than
the wayfarer. How so? I will tell you. The wayfarer knows when he is going into the inn, and
when he is going out; for the egress as well as the regress is in his own power: but when I
enter the inn, that is to say this present life, I know not when I shall go out: and it may be
that I am providing myself with sustenance for a long time when the Master suddenly
summons me saying “Thou fool, for whom shall those things be which thou hast prepared?
for on this very night thy soul is being taken from thee.”826 The time of thy departure is
uncertain, the tenure of thy possessions insecure, there are innumerable precipices, and
billows on every side of thee. Why dost thou rave about shadows? why desert the reality and
run after shadows?</p>
<p>6. I say these things, and shall not cease saying them, causing continual pain, and
dressing the wounds; and this not for the sake of the fallen, but of those who are still standing.
For they have departed, and their career is ended, but those who are yet standing have gained
a more secure position through their calamities. “What then,” you say, “shall we do?” Do
one thing only, hate riches, and love thy life—cast away thy goods; I do not say all of them,
but cut off the superfluities. Be not covetous of other men’s goods, strip not the widow,
plunder not the orphan, seize not his house: I do not address myself to persons but to facts.
But if any one’s conscience attacks him, he himself is responsible for it, not my words. Why
art thou grasping where thou bringest ill-will upon thyself? Grasp where there is a crown
to be gained. Strive to lay hold not of earth but of heaven. “The kingdom of Heaven belongs
to violent men and men of violence take it by force.”827 Why dost thou lay hold of the poor
man who reproaches thee? Lay hold of Christ who praises thee for it. Dost thou see thy
senselessness and madness? Dost thou lay hold of the poor man who has little? Christ says
“lay hold of me; I thank thee for it, lay hold of my kingdom and take it by violence.” If thou
art minded to lay hold of an earthly kingdom, or rather if thou art minded to have designs
upon it thou art punished; but in the case of the heavenly kingdom thou art punished if
thou dost not lay hold of it. Where worldly things are concerned there is ill-will, but where

spiritual there is love. Meditate daily on these things, and if two days hence thou seest another
riding in a chariot, arrayed in raiment of silk, and elated with pride, be not again dismayed
and troubled. Praise not a rich man, but only him who lives in righteousness. Revile
not a poor man, but learn to have an upright and accurate judgment in all things.</p>
<p>Do not hold aloof from the Church; for nothing is stronger than the Church. The Church
is thy hope, thy salvation, thy refuge. It is higher than the heaven, it is wider than the earth.
It never waxes old, but is always in full vigour. Wherefore as significant of its solidity and
stability Holy Scripture calls it a mountain: or of its purity a virgin, or of its magnificence a
queen; or of its relationship to God a daughter; and to express its productiveness it calls her
barren who has borne seven: in fact it employs countless names to represent its nobleness.
For as the master of the Church has many names: being called the Father, and the way,828
and the life,829 and the light,830 and the arm,831 and the propitiation,832 and the foundation,
833 and the door,834 and the sinless one,835 and the treasure,836 and Lord, and God,
and Son, and the only begotten, and the form of God,837 and the image838 of God so is it
with the Church itself: does one name suffice to present the whole truth? by no means. But
for this reason there are countless names, that we may learn something concerning God,
though it be but a small part. Even so the Church also is called by many names. She is called
a virgin, albeit formerly she was an harlot: for this is the miracle wrought by the Bridegroom,
that He took her who was an harlot and hath made her a virgin. Oh! what a new and strange
event! With us marriage destroys virginity, but with God marriage hath restored it. With
us she who is a virgin, when married, is a virgin no longer: with Christ she who is an harlot,
when married, becomes a virgin.</p>
<p>7. Let the heretic who inquires curiously into the nature of heavenly generation saying
“how did the Father beget the Son?” interpret this single fact, ask him how did the Church,
being an harlot, become a virgin? and how did she having brought forth children remain a
virgin? “For I am jealous over you,” saith Paul, “with a godly jealousy, for I espoused you

to one husband that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.”839 What wisdom and
understanding! “I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy.” What means this? “I am jealous,”
he says: art thou jealous seeing thou art a spiritual man? I am jealous he says as God
is. And hath God jealousy? yea the jealousy not of passion, but of love, and earnest zeal. I
am jealous over you with the jealousy of God. Shall I tell thee how He manifests His jealousy?
He saw the world corrupted by devils, and He delivered His own Son to save it. For words
spoken in reference to God have not the same force as when spoken in reference to ourselves:
for instance we say God is jealous, God is wroth, God repents, God hates. These words are
human, but they have a meaning which becomes the nature of God. How is God jealous?
“I am jealous over you with the jealousy of God.”840 Is God wroth? “O Lord reproach me
not in thine indignation.”841 Doth God slumber? “Awake, wherefore sleepest thou, O
Lord?”842 Doth God repent? “I repent that I have made man.”843 Doth God hate? “My soul
hateth your feasts and your new moons.”844 Well do not consider the poverty of the expres-
sions: but grasp their divine meaning. God is jealous, for He loves, God is wroth, not as
yielding to passion, but for the purpose of chastising, and punishing. God sleeps, not as
really slumbering, but as being long-suffering. Choose out the expression. Thus when thou
hearest that God begets the Son, think not of division but of the unity of substance. For God
has taken many of these words from us as we also have borrowed others from Him, that we
may receive honour thereby.</p>
<p>8. Dost thou understand what I have said? Attend carefully my beloved. There are divine
names, and there are human names. God has received from me, and He Himself hath given
to me. Give me thine, and take mine He says. Thou hast need of mine: I have no need of
thine, but thou hast of mine inasmuch as my nature is unmixed, but thou art a human being
encompassed with a body, seeking also corporeal terms in order that, by borrowing expressions
which are familiar to thee, thou who art thus encompassed with a body, mayest be
able to think on thoughts which transcend thy understanding. What kind of names hath
He received from me, and what kind hath He given to me? He Himself is God, and He hath
called me God; with Him is the essential nature as an actual fact, with me only the honour
of the name: “I have said ye are gods, and ye are all children of the most highest.”845 Here
are words, but in the other case there is the actual reality. He hath called me god, for by that

name I have received honour. He Himself was called man, he was called Son of man, he was
called the Way, the Door, the Rock. These words He borrowed from me; the others He gave
from Himself to me. Wherefore was He called the Way? That thou mightest understand
that by Him we have access to the Father. Wherefore was He called the Rock? that thou
mightest understand the secure and unshaken character of the faith. Wherefore was He
called the Foundation? That thou mightest understand that He upholdeth all things.
Wherefore was He called the Root? That thou mightest understand that in Him we have
our power of growth. Wherefore was He called the Shepherd? Because He feeds us.
Wherefore was He called a sheep? Because He was sacrificed for us and became a propitiatory
offering. Wherefore was He called the Life? Because He raised us up when we were dead.
Wherefore was He called the Light? Because He delivered us from darkness. Why was He
called an Arm? Because He is of one substance with the Father. Why was He called the
Word? Because He was begotten of the Father. For as my word is the offspring of my spirit,
even so was the Son begotten of the Father. Wherefore is He called our raiment? Because I
was clothed with Him when I was baptized. Why is He called a table? Because I feed upon
Him when I partake of the mysteries. Why is He called a house? Because I dwell in Him.
Why is He called an inmate of the house? Because we become His Temple. Wherefore is
He called the Head? Because I have been made a member of His. Why is He called a Bridegroom?
Because He hath taken me as His bride. Wherefore is He called undefiled? Because
He took me as a virgin. Wherefore is He called Master? Because I am His bondmaid.</p>
<p>9. For observe the Church, how, as I was saying, she is sometimes a bride, sometimes a
daughter, sometimes a virgin, sometimes a bondmaid, sometimes a queen, sometimes a
barren woman, sometimes a mountain, sometimes a garden, sometimes fruitful in children,
sometimes a lily, sometimes a fountain: She is all things. Therefore having heard these things,
think not I pray you that they are corporeal; but stretch thy thought further: for such things
cannot be corporeal. For example: the mountain is not the maid: the maid is not the bride:
the queen is not the bond-maid: yet the Church is all these things. Wherefore? because the
element in which they exist is not corporeal but spiritual. For in a corporeal sphere these
things are confined within narrow limits: but in a spiritual sphere they have a wide field of
operation. “The queen stood on thy right hand.”846 The queen? How did she who was downtrodden
and poor become a queen? and where did she ascend? the queen herself stood on
high by the side of the king. How? because the king became a servant; He was not that by
nature, but He became so. Understand therefore the things which belong to the Godhead,
and discern those which belong to the Dispensation. Understand what He was, and what
He became for thy sake, and do not confuse things which are distinct, nor make the argument
of his lovingkindness an occasion for blasphemy. He was lofty, and she was lowly: lofty not

by position but by nature. His essence was pure, and imperishable: His nature was incorruptible,
unintelligible, invisible, incomprehensible, eternal, unchangeable, transcending the
nature of angels, higher than the powers above, overpowering reason, surpassing thought,
apprehended not by sight but by faith alone. Angels beheld Him and trembled, the Cheru
bim veiled themselves with their wings, in awe. He looked upon the earth, and caused it to
tremble: He threatened the sea and dried it up:847 he brought rivers out of the desert: He
weighed the mountains in scales, and the valleys in a balance.848 How shall I express myself?
how shall I present the truth? His greatness hath no bounds, His wisdom is beyond reckoning,
His judgments are untraceable, His ways unsearchable.849 Such is His greatness and His
power, if indeed it is safe even to use such expressions. But what am I to do? I am a human
being and I speak in human language: my tongue is of earth and I crave forgiveness from
my Lord. For I do not use these expressions in a spirit of presumption, but on account of
the poverty of my resources arising from my feebleness and the nature of our human tongue.
Be merciful to me, O Lord, for I utter these words not in presumption but because I have
no others: nevertheless I do not rest content with the meanness of my speech, but soar upwards
on the wings of my understanding. Such is His greatness and power. I say this, that
without dwelling on the words, or on the poverty of the expressions, thou mayest also thyself
learn to act in the same way. Why dost thou marvel if I do this, inasmuch as He also does
the same, when He wishes to present something to our minds which transcends human
powers? Since He addresses human beings He uses also human illustration, which are indeed
insufficient to represent the thing spoken of, and cannot exhibit the full proportions of the
matter, yet suffice for the infirmity of the hearers.</p>
<p>10. Make an effort, and do not grow weary of my prolonged discourse. For as when He
manifests Himself, He is not manifested as He really is, nor is His bare essence manifested
(for no man hath seen God in His real nature; for when He is but partially revealed the
Cherubim tremble—the mountains smoke, the sea is dried up, the heaven is shaken, and if
the revelation were not partial who could endure it?) as then, I say, He does not manifest
Himself as He really is, but only as the beholder is able to see Him, therefore doth He appear
sometimes in the form of old age, sometimes of youth, sometimes in fire, sometimes in air,
sometimes in water, sometimes in armour, not altering his essential nature, but fashioning
His appearance to suit the various condition of those who are affected by it. In like manner
also when any one wishes to say anything concerning Him he employs human illustrations.
For instance I say: “He went up into the mountain and He was transfigured before them,
<note type="footnote">847 Is. li. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">848 Is. xl. 12. Septuagint.</note>
<note type="footnote">849 Rom. xi. 33. Chrysostom has transposed the order of the adjectives.</note>

<pb n="357"/>
and His countenance shone as the sun, and His raiment became white as snow.”850 He
disclosed, it is said, a little of the Godhead, He manifested to them the God dwelling amongst
them “and He was transfigured before them.” Attend carefully to the statement. The writer
says and He was transfigured before them, and His raiment shone as the light, and His
countenance was as the sun. When I said “such is His greatness and power” and added “be
merciful to me O Lord,” (for I do not rest satisfied with the expression but am perplexed,
having no other framed for the purpose) I wish you to understand, that I learned this lesson
from Holy Scripture. The evangelist then wished to describe His splendour and he says “He
shone.” How did He shine? tell me. Exceedingly. And how do you express this? He shone
“as the sun.” As the sun sayest thou? Yea. Wherefore? Because I know not any other luminary
more brilliant. And He was white sayest thou as snow? wherefore as snow? Because I know
not any other substance which is whiter. For that He did not really shine thus is proved by
what follows: the disciples fell to the ground. If he had shone as the sun the disciples would
not have fallen; for they saw the sun every day, and did not fall: but inasmuch as he shone
more brilliantly than the sun or snow, they, being unable to bear the splendour, fell to the
earth.</p>
<p>11. Tell me then, O evangelist, did He shine more brightly than the sun, and yet dost
thou say, “as the sun?” Yea: wishing to make that light known to thee, I know not any other
greater luminary, I have no other comparison which holds a royal place amongst luminaries.
I have said these things that thou mayest not rest contentedly in the poverty of the language
used: I have pointed out to thee the fall of the disciples: they fell to the earth, and were
stupified and overwhelmed with slumber. “Arise” He said, and lifted them up, and yet they
were oppressed. For they could not endure the excessive brightness of that shining, but
heavy sleep took possession of their eyes: so far did the light which was manifested exceed
the light of the sun. Yet the evangelist said “as the sun,” because that luminary is familiar
to us and surpasses all the rest.</p>
<p>But as I was saying, He who was thus great and powerful desired an harlot. I speak of
our human nature under that name. If a man indeed desire an harlot he is condemned, and
doth God desire one? Yea verily. Again a man desireth an harlot that he may become a fornicator:
but God that He may convert the harlot into a virgin: so that the desire of the man
is the destruction of her who is desired: but the desire of God is salvation to her who is desired.
And why did He who is so great and powerful desire an harlot? that He might become
the husband thereof. How doth He act? He doth not send to her any of His servants, He
sendeth not angel, archangel, Cherubim, or Seraphim; but He himself draws nigh Who loves
her. Again when thou hearest of love, deem it not sensuous. Cull out the thoughts which
<note type="footnote">850 Matt. xvii. 2: Mark ix. 2. Chrysostom mixes up the accounts of the two Evangelists, and does not quote
the exact words of either.</note>

<pb n="358"/>
are contained in the words, even as an excellent bee settles on the flowers, and takes the
honey comb, but leaves the herbs God desired an harlot, and how doth He act? He does not
conduct her on high; for He would not bring an harlot into Heaven, but He Himself comes
down. Since she could not ascend on high, He descends to earth. He cometh to the harlot,
and is not ashamed: He cometh to her secret dwelling place. He beholds her in her drunkenness.
And how doth He come? not in the bare essence of His original nature, but He becomes
that which the harlot was, not in intention but in reality does He become this, in order
that she may not be scared when she sees Him, that she may not rush away, and escape. He
cometh to the harlot, and becomes man. And how does He become this? He is conceived
in the womb, he increases little by little and follows like me the course of human growth.
Who is it who does this? the Deity as manifested, not the Godhead; the form of the servant
not that of the Master; the flesh which belongs to me, not the essential nature which belongs
to Him: He increases little by little, and has intercourse with mankind. Although He finds
the harlot, human nature, full of sores, brutalised, and oppressed by devils, how does He
act? He draws nigh to her. She sees Him and flees away. He calleth the wise men saying Why
are ye afraid? I am not a judge, but a physician. “I came not to judge the world but to save
the world.”851 Straightway He calleth the wise men. Oh! new and strange event. The immediate
first-fruits of His coming are wise men. He who upholds the world lieth in a manger,
and He who careth for all things is a nursling in swaddling bands. The temple is founded
and the God dwelleth therein. And wise men come and straightway worship Him: the
publican comes and is turned into an evangelist: the harlot comes and is turned into a
maiden: the Canaanitish woman comes and partakes of his lovingkindness. This is the mark
of one who loves, to forbear demanding an account of sins, and to forgive transgressions
and offences. And how does He act? He takes the sinner and espouses her to himself. And
what doth He give her? a signet ring. Of what nature? the Holy Spirit. Paul saith “now He
who establisheth us with you is God who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the
Spirit.”852 The Spirit then He giveth her. Next He saith “Did not I plant thee in a garden?”
She saith “yea.” And how didst thou fall from thence? “The devil came and cast me out of
the garden.” Thou wast planted in the garden and he cast thee out: behold I plant thee in
myself, I uphold thee. How? The devil dares not approach me. Neither do I take thee up
into Heaven; but something greater than Heaven is here: I carry thee in myself who am the
Lord of Heaven. The shepherd carries thee and the wolf no longer comes: or rather I permit
him to approach. And so the Lord carrieth our nature: and the devil approaches and is
worsted. “I have planted thee in myself:” therefore He saith “I am the root, ye are the
branches:”853 so He planted her in Himself. “But,” she saith, “I am a sinner and unclean.”

“Let not this trouble thee, I am a physician. I know my vessel, I know how it was perverted.
It was formerly a vessel of clay, and it was perverted. I remodel it by means of the laver of
regeneration and I submit it to the action of fire.” For observe: He took dust from the earth
and made the man; He formed him. The devil came, and perverted him. Then the Lord
came, took him again, and remoulded, and recast him in baptism, and He suffered not his
body to be of clay, but made it of a harder ware. He subjected the soft clay to the fire of the
Holy Spirit. “He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire:”854 He was baptized
with water that he might be remodelled, with fire that he might be hardened. Therefore the
Prophet speaking beforehand under divine guidance declared “Thou shalt dash them in
pieces like vessels of the potter.”855 He did not say like vessels of earthenware which every
one possesses: for by a potter’s vessels are meant those which the potter is fashioning on the
wheel: now the potter’s vessels are of clay, but ours are of harder ware. Speaking beforehand
therefore of the remoulding which is wrought by means of baptism he saith, “thou shalt
dash them in pieces like vessels of a potter”—He means that He remodels and recasts them.
I descend into the water of baptism, and the fashion of my nature is remoulded, and the fire
of the Spirit recasts it, and it is turned into a harder ware. And that my words are no empty
vaunt hear what Job says, “He hath made us as clay,”856 and Paul, “but we have this treasure
in earthen vessels.”857 But consider the strength of the earthen vessel: for it has been hardened
not by fire, but by the Spirit. How was it proved to be an earthen vessel? “Five times received
I forty stripes save one, thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned,”858 and yet the
earthen vessel was not shattered. “A day and a night have I been in the deep.” He hath been
in the deep, and the earthen vessel was not dissolved: he suffered shipwreck and the treasure
was not lost; the ship was submerged and yet the freight floated. “But we have this treasure”
he says. What kind of treasure? a supply of the Spirit, righteousness, sanctification, redemption.
Of what nature, tell me? “in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk.”859 “Æneas,
Jesus Christ maketh thee whole,”860 I say unto thee thou evil spirit, go out of him.861</p>
<p>12. Hast thou seen a treasure more brilliant than royal treasures? For what can the pearl
of a king do like that which the words of an Apostle effected? Set crowns innumerable upon
dead men, and they will not be raised: but one word went forth from an Apostle, and it

brought back revoked nature, and restored it to its ancient condition. “But we have this
treasure.” O treasure which not only is preserved, but also preserves the house where it is
stored up. Dost thou understand what I have said? The kings of the earth, and rulers when
they have treasures, prepare large houses, having strong walls, bars, doors, guards, and bolts
in order that the treasure may be preserved: but Christ did the contrary: He placed the
treasure not in a stone vessel but in an earthen one. If the treasure is great wherefore is the
vessel weak? But the reason why the vessel is weak is not because the treasure is great; for
this is not preserved by the vessel, but itself preserves the vessel. I deposit the treasure: who
is able henceforth to steal it? The devil has come, the world has come, multitudes have come,
and yet they have not stolen the treasure: the vessel has been scourged, yet the treasure was
not betrayed; it has been drowned in the sea, yet the treasure was not shipwrecked: it has
died yet the treasure survives. He gave therefore the earnest of the Spirit. Where are they
who blaspheme the Spirit’s majesty? Give ye heed. “He that establisheth us with you in Christ
is God who also hath given the earnest of the Spirit.”862 You all know that the earnest is a
small part of the whole; let me tell you how. Some one goes to buy a house at a great price;
and he says “give me an earnest that I may have confidence: or one goes to take a wife for
himself, he arranges about dowry and property, and he says “give me an earnest.” Observe:
in the purchase of a slave and in all covenants there is an earnest. Since then Christ made a
covenant with us (for He was about to take me as a bride) he also assigned a dowry to me
not of money, but of blood. But this dowry which He assigns is the bestowal of good things
“such as eye hath not seen, and ear hath not heard, neither hath entered into the heart of
man.”863 He assigned them for the dowry:—immortality, praise with the angels, release
from death, freedom from sin, the inheritance of a kingdom (so great are his riches), righteousness,
sanctification, deliverance from present evils, discovery of future blessings. Great
was my dowry. Now attend carefully: mark what He does. He came to take the harlot, for
so I call her, unclean as she was, that thou mightest understand the love of the bridegroom.
He came; He took me: He assigns me a dowry: He saith “I give thee my wealth.” How? “Hast
thou lost,” He saith, “paradise?” take it back. Hast thou lost thy beauty? take it back; take
all these things. But yet the dowry was not given to me here.</p>
<p>13. Observe, this is the reason why He speaks beforehand with reference to this dowry;
He warranted to me in the dowry the resurrection of the body,—immortality. For immortality
does not always follow resurrection, but the two are distinct. For many have risen, and
been again laid low, like Lazarus and the bodies of the saints.864 But in this case it is not so,
but the promise is of resurrection, immortality, a place in the joyful company of angels, the

meeting of the Son of Man in the clouds, and the fulfilment of the saying “so shall we ever
be with the Lord,”865 the release from death, the freedom from sin, the complete overthrow
of destruction. Of what kind is that? “Eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered
into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him.” Dost
thou give me good things which I know not? He saith “yea; only be espoused to me here,
love me in this world.” “Wherefore dost thou not give me the dowry here?” “It will be given
when thou hast come to my Father, when thou hast entered the royal palace. Didst thou
come to me! nay I came to thee. I came not that thou shouldst abide here but that I might
take thee and return. Seek not the dowry here: all depends on hope, and faith. “And dost
thou give me nothing in this world?” He answers. “Receive an earnest that thou mayest trust
me concerning that which is to come: receive pledges and betrothal gifts.” Therefore Paul
saith “I have espoused you.”866 As gifts of betrothal God has given us present blessings: they
are an earnest of the future; but the full dowry abides in the other world. How so? I will tell
you. Here I grow old, there I grow not old; here I die, there I die not, here I sorrow, there I
sorrow not; here is poverty, and disease, and intrigue, there nothing of that kind exists: here
is darkness and light, there is light alone: here is intrigue, there is liberty; here is disease,
there is health; here is life which has an end, there is life which hath no end; here is sin, there
is righteousness, and sin is banished; here is envy, there nothing of the kind exists. “Give
me these things” one says; “Nay! wait in order that thy fellow-servants also may be saved;
wait I say. He who establisheth us and hath given us the earnest”—what kind of earnest?
the Holy Spirit, the supply of the Spirit. Let me speak concerning the Spirit. He gave the
signet ring to the Apostles, saying “take this and give it to all.” Is the ring then portioned
out, and yet not divided? It is so. Let me teach you the meaning of the supply of the Spirit:
Peter received, and Paul also received the Holy Spirit. He went about the world, he released
sinners from their sins, he restored the lame, he clothed the naked, he raised the dead, he
cleansed the lepers, he bridled the devil, he strangled the demons, he held converse with
God, he planted a Church, levelled temples to the earth, overturned altars, destroyed vice,
established virtue, made angels of men.</p>
<p>14. All these things we were. But “the earnest” filled the whole world. And when I say
the whole I mean all which the sun shines upon, sea, islands, mountains, valleys, and hills.
Paul went hither and thither, like some winged creature, with one mouth only contending
against the enemy, he the tentmaker, who handled the workman’s knife and sewed skins
together: and yet this his craft was no hindrance to his virtue, but the tentmaker was stronger
than demons, the uneloquent man was wiser than the wise. Whence was this? He received
the earnest, he bore the signet ring and carried it about. All men saw that the King had es-

<pb n="362"/>
poused our nature: the demon saw it and retreated, he saw the earnest, and trembled and
withdrew: he saw but the Apostle’s garments867 and fled. O the power of the Holy Spirit.
He bestowed authority not on the soul, nor on the body, but even on raiment; nor on raiment
only but even on a shadow. Peter went about and his shadow put diseases to flight,868 and
expelled demons, and raised the dead to life. Paul went about the world, cutting away the
thorns of ungodliness, sowing broadcast the seeds of godliness, like an excellent ploughman
handling the ploughshare of doctrine. And to whom did he go? To Thracians, to Scythians,
to Indians, to Maurians, to Sardinians, to Goths, to wild savages, and he changed them all.
By what means? By means of “the earnest.” How was he sufficient for these things? By the
grace of the Spirit. Unskilled, ill-clothed, ill-shod he was upheld by Him “who also hath
given the earnest of the Spirit.” Therefore he saith “and who is sufficient for these things?869
But our sufficiency is of God, who hath made us sufficient as ministers of the new Testament,
not of the letter but of the Spirit.”870 Behold what the Spirit hath wrought: He found the
earth filled with demons and He has made it heaven. For meditate not on present things
but review the past in your thought. Formerly there was lamentation, there were altars
everywhere, everywhere the smoke and fumes of sacrifice, everywhere unclean rites and
mysteries, and sacrifices, everywhere demons holding their orgies, everywhere a citadel of
the devil, everywhere fornication decked with wreaths of honour; and Paul stood alone.
How did he escape being overwhelmed, or torn in pieces? How could he open his mouth?
He entered the Thebaid,871 and made captives of men, He entered the royal palace, and
made a disciple of the king.872 He entered the hall of judgment, and the judge saith to him
“almost thou persuadest me to become a Christian,”873 and the judge became a disciple. He
entered the prison, and took the jailor captive.874 He visited an island of barbarians, and
made a viper the instrument of his teaching.875 He visited the Romans, and attracted the
senate to his doctrine. He visited rivers, and desert places in all parts of the world. There is
no land or sea which has not shared in the benefits of his labours; for God has given human

nature the earnest of His signet, and when He gives it He saith: some things I give thee now,
and others I promise. Therefore the prophet saith concerning her “The queen did stand
upon thy right hand in a vesture woven with gold.” He does not mean a real vesture, but
virtue. Therefore the Scripture elsewhere saith “How camest thou in hither not having a
wedding garment?” so that here he does not mean a garment, but fornication, and foul and
unclean living. As then foul raiment signifies sin, so does golden raiment signify virtue. But
this raiment belonged to the king. He Himself bestowed the raiment upon her: for she was
naked, naked and disfigured. “The queen stood on thy right hand in a vesture woven with
gold.”876 He is speaking not of raiment but of virtue. Observe: the expression itself has great
nobility of meaning. He does not say “in a vesture of gold” but “in a vesture woven with
gold.” Listen intelligently. A vesture of gold is one which is gold throughout: but a vesture
woven with gold is one which is partly of gold, partly of silk. Why then did he say that the
bride wore not a vesture of gold, but one woven with gold? Attend carefully. He means the
constitution of the Church in its varied manifestations. For since we do not all belong to
one condition of life, but one is a virgin, another a widow, a third lives a life of devotion—so
the robe of the Church signifies the constitution of the Church.</p>
<p>15. Inasmuch then as our Master knew that if He carved out only one road for us, many
must shrink from it, He carved out divers roads. Thou canst not enter the kingdom it may
be by the way of virginity. Enter it then by the way of single marriage. Canst thou not enter
it by one marriage? Perchance thou mayest by means of a second marriage. Thou canst not
enter by the way of continence: enter then by the way of almsgiving: or thou canst not enter
by the way of almsgiving? then try the way of fasting. If thou canst not use this way, take
that—or if not that, then take this. Therefore the prophet spoke not of a garment of gold,
but of one woven with gold. It is of silk, or purple, or gold. Thou canst not be a golden part?
then be a silken one. I accept thee, if only thou art clothed in my raiment. Therefore also
Paul saith “If any man builds upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones.”877 Thou
canst not be the precious stone? then be the gold. Thou canst not be the gold? then be the
silver, if only thou art resting upon the foundation. And again elsewhere, “there is one glory
of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars.”878 Thou canst
not be a sun? then be a moon. Thou canst not be a moon? then be a star. Thou canst not be
a large star? be content to be a little one if only thou art in the Heaven. Thou canst not be a
virgin? then live continently in the married state, only abiding in the Church. Thou canst
not be without possessions? then give alms, only abiding in the Church, only wearing the
proper raiment, only submitting to the queen.879 The raiment is woven with gold, it is

manifold in texture. I do not bar the way against thee: for the abundance of virtues has
rendered the dispensation of the king easy in operation. “Clothed in a vesture woven with
gold, manifold in texture.” Her vesture is manifold: unfold, if you please, the deep meaning
of the expression here used, and fix your eyes upon this garment woven with gold. For here
indeed some live celibate, others live in an honourable estate of matrimony being not much
inferior to them: some have married once, others are widows in the flower of their age. For
what purpose is a paradise? and wherefore its variety? having divers flowers, and trees, and
many pearls. There are many stars, but only one sun: there are many ways of living, but only
one paradise; there are many temples, but only one mother of them all. There is the body,
the eye, the finger, but all these make up but one man. There is the same distinction between
the small, the great, and the less. The virgin hath need of the married woman; for the virgin
also is the product of marriage, that marriage may not be despised by her. The virgin is the
root of marriage: thus all things have been linked together, the small with the great, and the
great with the small. “The queen did stand on thy right hand clothed in a vesture wrought
with gold, manifold in texture.” Then follows “Hearken! O daughter.” The conductor of the
bride says that thou art about to go forth from thy home to the home of the bridegroom
who in his essential nature far surpasses thee. I am the conductor of the bride. “Hearken O
daughter.” Did she immediately become the wife? Yea: for here there is nothing corporeal.
For He espoused her as a wife, He loves her as a daughter, He provides for her as a handmaid,
He guards her as a virgin, He fences her round like a garden, and cherishes her like a
member: as a head He provides for her, as a root he causes her to grow, as a shepherd He
feeds her, as a bridegroom He weds her, as a propitiation He pardons her, as a sheep He is
sacrificed, as a bridegroom He preserves her in beauty, as a husband He provides for her
support. Many are the meanings in order that we may enjoy a part if it be but a small part
of the divine economy of grace. “Hearken O daughter” and behold, and look upon things
which are bridal and yet spiritual. Hearken O daughter. She was at first a daughter of demons,
a daughter of the earth, unworthy of the earth and now she has become a daughter of the
king. And this He wished who loved her. For he who loves does not investigate character:
love does not regard uncomeliness: on this account indeed is it called love because it oftentimes
hath affection for an uncomely person.880 Thus also did Christ. He saw one who was
uncomely (for comely I could not call her) and He loved her, and He makes her young, not
having spot or wrinkle. Oh what a bridegroom! adorning with grace the ungracefulness of
his bride! Hearken O daughter! hearken and behold! Two things He saith “Hearken” and
“Behold,” two which depend on thyself, one on thy eyes, the other on thy hearing. Now
since her dowry depended on hearing (and although some of you have been acute enough
<note type="footnote">880 The statement is grounded on a mistaken etymology. There is also an allusion to the proverbial blindness
of love.</note>

<pb n="365"/>
to perceive this already, let them tarry for those who are feebler: I commend those who have
anticipated the truth, and make allowances for those who only follow in their track) since
the dowry then depended on hearing—(and what is meant by hearing? faith: for “faith
cometh by hearing” faith as opposed to fruition, and actual experience) I said before that
He divided the dowry into two, and gave some portion to the bride for an earnest, whilst
He promised others in the future. What did He give her? He gave her forgiveness of sins,
remission of punishment, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, the body of the Lord,
the divine, spiritual Table, the resurrection of the dead. For all these things the Apostles
had. Therefore He gave some parts and promised others. Of some there was experience and
fruition, others depended upon hope and faith. Now listen. What did He bestow? Baptism
and the Sacrifice. Of these there is experience. What did He promise? Resurrection, immortality
of the body, union with angels, a place in the joyful company of archangels, and as a
citizen in His kingdom, immaculate life, the good things “which eye hath not seen, nor ear
heard nor have entered into the heart of man, things which God hath prepared for them
that love Him.”</p>
<p>16. Understand what is said, lest ye lose it: I am labouring to enable you to perceive it.
The dowry of the bride then was divided into two portions consisting of things present and
things to come; things seen and things heard, things given and things taken on trust, things
experienced, and things to be enjoyed hereafter; things belonging to present life, and things
to come after the resurrection. The former things you see, the latter you hear. Observe then
what He says to her that you may not suppose that she received the former things only,
though they be great and ineffable, and surpassing all understanding. “Hearken O daughter
and behold;” hear the latter things and behold the former that thou mayest not say “am I
again to depend on hope, again on faith, again on the future?” See now: I give some things,
and I promise others: the latter indeed depend on hope, but do thou receive the others as
pledges, as an earnest, as a proof of the remainder. I promise thee a kingdom: and let present
things be the ground of thy trust, thy trust in me. Dost thou promise me a kingdom? Yea.
I have given thee the greater part, even the Lord of the kingdom, for “he who spared not his
own son, but gave him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all
things?”881 Dost thou give me the resurrection of the body? Yea; I have given thee the
greater part. What is the nature of it? Release from sins. How is that the greater part? Because
sin brought forth death. I have destroyed the parent, and shall I not destroy the offspring?
I have dried up the root, and shall I not destroy the produce. “Hearken O daughter and behold.”
What am I to behold? Dead men raised to life, lepers cleansed, the sea restrained, the
paralytic braced up into vigour, paradise opened, loaves poured forth in abundance, sins
remitted, the lame man leaping, the robber made a citizen of paradise, the publican turned

into an evangelist, the harlot become more modest than the maid. Hear and behold. Hear
of the former things and behold these. Accept from present things a proof of the others;
concerning those I have given thee pledges, things which are better than they are. “What is
the meaning of this thy saying?” These things are mine. “Hearken O daughter and behold.”
These things are my dower to thee. And what doth the bride contribute? Let us see. What
I pray thee dost thou bring that thou mayest not be portionless? What can I, she answers,
bring to thee from heathen altars, and the steam of sacrifices and from devils? What have I
to contribute? what? sayest thou? Thy will and thy faith. “Hearken O daughter and behold.”
And what wilt thou have me do? “Forget thy own people.” What kind of people? the devils,
the idols, the sacrificial smoke, and steam, and blood. “Forget thy own people, and thy
father’s house.” Leave thy father and come after me. I left my Father, and came to thee, and
wilt thou not leave thy father? But when the word leave is used in reference to the Son do
not understand by it an actual leaving. What He means is “I condescended, I accommodated
myself to thee, I assumed human flesh.” This is the duty of the bridegroom, and of the bride,
that thou shouldest abandon thy parents, and that we should be wedded to one another.
“Hearken O daughter and behold, and forget thy own people, and thy father’s house.” And
what dost thou give me if I do forget them? “and the king shall desire thy beauty.” Thou
hast the Lord for thy lover. If thou hast Him for thy lover, thou hast also the things which
are his. I trust ye may be able to understand what is said: for the thought is a subtle one, and
I wish to stop the mouth of the Jews.</p>
<p>Now exert your minds I pray: for whether one hears, or forbears to hear I shall dig and
till the soil. “Hearken O daughter, and behold, forget also thy own people, and thy father’s
house, and the king shall desire thy beauty.” By beauty in this passage the Jew understands
sensible beauty; not spiritual but corporeal.</p>
<p>17. Attend, and let us learn what corporeal, and what spiritual beauty are. There is soul
and body: they are two substances: there is a beauty of body, and there is a beauty of soul.
What is beauty of body? an extended eyebrow, a merry glance, a blushing cheek, ruddy lips,
a straight neck, long wavy hair, tapering fingers, upright stature, a fair blooming complexion.
Does this bodily beauty come from nature, or from choice? Confessedly it comes from
nature. Attend that thou mayest learn the conception of philosophers. This beauty whether
of the countenance, of the eye, of the hair, of the brow, does it come from nature, or from
choice? It is obvious that it comes from nature. For the ungraceful woman, even if she cultivate
beauty in countless ways, cannot become graceful in body: for natural conditions are
fixed, and confined by limits which they cannot pass over. Therefore the beautiful woman
is always beautiful, even if she has no taste for beauty: and the ungraceful cannot make
herself graceful, nor the graceful ungraceful. Wherefore? because these things come from
nature. Well! thou hast seen corporeal beauty. Now let us turn inwards to the soul: let the
handmaid approach the mistress! let us turn I say to the soul. Look upon that beauty, or

rather listen to it: for thou canst not see it since it is invisible—Listen to that beauty. What
then is beauty of soul? Temperance, mildness, almsgiving, love, brotherly kindness, tender
affection, obedience to God, the fulfilment of the law, righteousness, contrition of heart.
These things are the beauty of the soul. These things then are not the results of nature, but
of moral disposition. And he who does not possess these things is able to receive them, and
he who has them, if he becomes careless, loses them. For as in the case of the body I was
saying that she who is ungraceful cannot become graceful; so in the case of the soul I say
the contrary that the graceless soul can become full of grace. For what was more graceless
than the soul of Paul when he was a blasphemer and insulter: what more full of grace when
he said “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith.”882
What was more graceless than the soul of the robber? what more full of grace when he heard
the words “Verily I say unto thee to-day shalt thou be with me in paradise?”883 What was
more graceless than the publican when he practised extortion? but what more full of grace
when he declared his resolution.884 Seest thou that thou canst not alter grace of body, for
it is the result not of moral disposition, but of nature. But grace of soul is supplied out of
our own moral choice. Thou hast now received the definition. Of what kind are they? that
the beauty of the soul proceeds from obedience to God. For if the graceless soul obeys God
it puts off its ungracefulness, and becomes full of grace. “Saul! Saul!” it was said, “why persecutest
thou me?” and he replied “and who art Thou Lord?” “I am Jesus.”885 And he obeyed,
and his obedience made the graceless soul full of grace. Again, He saith to the publican
“come follow me”886 and the publican rose up and became an apostle: and the graceless
soul became full of grace. Whence? by obedience. Again He saith to the fishermen “Come
ye after me and I will make you to become fishers of men:”887 and by their obedience their
minds became full of grace. Let us see then what kind of beauty He is speaking of here.
“Hearken O daughter and behold, and forget thy own people and thy father’s house, and
the king shall desire thy beauty.” What kind of beauty will he desire? the spiritual kind. How
so? because she is to “forget” He saith “hearken and forget.” These are acts of moral choice.
“Hearken!” he said: an ungraceful one hears and her ungracefulness being that of the body
is not removed. To the sinful woman He has said “Hearken,” and if she will obey she sees
what manner of beauty is bestowed upon her. Since then the ungracefulness of the bride
was not physical, but moral (for she did not obey God but transgressed) therefore he leads

her to another remedy. Thou didst become ungraceful then, not by nature, but by moral
choice: and thou didst become full of grace by obedience. “Hearken O daughter and behold
and forget thy own people, and thy father’s house, and the king shall desire thy beauty.”
Then that thou mayest learn that he does not mean anything visible to sense, when thou
hearest the word beauty, think not of eye, or nose, or mouth, or neck, but of piety, faith,
love, things which are within—“for all the glory of the king’s daughter is from within.” Now
for all these things let us offer thanks to God, the giver, for to Him alone belongeth glory,
honour, might, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>ST. CHRYSOSTOM:
A TREATISE
TO PROVE THAT NO ONE CAN HARM THE MAN WHO DOES
NOT INJURE HIMSELF.</p>
<p>TRANSLATED BY
REV. W. R. W. STEPHENS, M.A.,
PREBENDARY OF CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL, AND RECTOR OF WOOLBEDING,
SUSSEX.</p>
</div>

<div type="commentary" subtype="introduction">
<pb n="370"/>
<head>INTRODUCTION TO THE TREATISE THAT NO ONE CAN
HARM THE MAN WHO DOES NOT INJURE HIMSELF.</head>
<p>This very beautiful treatise was composed when St. Chrysostom was in exile, probably
not long before his death, and was sent with a letter to his great friend the deaconess
Olympias in Constantinople.</p>
<p>Plato in the 10th book of his Dialogue called the “Republic” employs an argument to
prove the immortality of the soul, so nearly resembling a portion of this treatise that I can
scarcely doubt St. Chrysostom had it in his mind. The following is the passage in the Platonic
dialogue as rendered in the excellent translation of Messrs. Davies U+0026 Vaughan. I omit a few
sentences here and there.</p>
<p>“Have you not learned, I asked, that our soul is immortal and never dies?</p>
<p>He looked at me and said in amazement. No really I have not: but can you maintain
this doctrine?</p>
<p>Yes as I am an honest man, I replied, and I think you could also. It is quite easy to do
it.</p>
<p>Proceed by all means.</p>
<p>So you call one thing good and another evil?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>And do we hold the same opinion as to the meaning of two terms?</p>
<p>What opinion do you hold?</p>
<p>I hold that the term evil comprises everything that destroys and corrupts, and the term
good everything that preserves and benefits.</p>
<p>So do I.</p>
<p>Again; do you maintain that everything has its evil and its good? Do you say for example
that the eyes are liable to the evil of ophthalmia, the entire body to disease, corn to mildew,
timber to rot, copper and iron to rust or in other words that almost everything is liable to
some connatural evil and malady?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>And is it not the case that, whenever an object is attacked by one of these maladies it is
impaired; and in the end completely broken up and destroyed by it?</p>
<p>Doubtless it is so?</p>
<p>Hence everything is destroyed by its own connatural evil and vice: otherwise if it be not
destroyed by this, there is nothing else that can corrupt it. For that which is good will never
destroy anything, nor yet that which is neither good nor evil.</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>

<pb n="371"/>
<p>If then we can find among existing things one which is liable to a particular evil which
can indeed mar it, but cannot break it up or destroy it, shall we not be at once certain that
a thing so constituted can never perish?</p>
<p>That would be a reasonable conclusion.</p>
<p>Well then is not the soul liable to a malady which renders it evil?</p>
<p>Certainly it is: all those things which we were lately discussing—injustice, intemperance,
cowardice, and ignorance—produce that result.”</p>
<p>Then having proved that although these things injure the soul they do not actually
destroy it he proceeds.</p>
<p>“Well, it is irrational to suppose that a thing can be destroyed by the depravity of another
thing, though it cannot be destroyed by its own.</p>
<p>True it is irrational.</p>
<p>Yes it is: for you must remember that we do not imagine that a body is to be destroyed
by the proper depravity of its food whatever that may be, whether mouldiness or rottenness
or anything else. But if the depravity of the food itself produces in the body a disorder
proper to the body, we shall assert that the body has been destroyed by its food remotely,
but by its own proper vice or disease, immediately: and we shall always disclaim the notion
that the body can be corrupted by the depravity of its food which is a different thing from
the body—that is to say, the notion that the body can be corrupted by an alien evil without
the introduction of its own native evil.</p>
<p>You are perfectly correct.</p>
<p>Then according to the same reasoning I continued, unless depravity of body introduces
into the soul depravity of soul let us never suppose that the soul can be destroyed by an alien
evil without the presence of its own peculiar disease: for that would be to suppose that one
thing can be destroyed by the evil of another thing.</p>
<p>That is a reasonable statement.</p>
<p>Well then let us either refute this doctrine and point out our mistake or else, so long as
it remains unrefuted, let us never assert that a fever or any other disease, or fatal violence,
or even the act of cutting up the entire body into the smallest possible pieces can have any
tendency to destroy the soul, until it has been demonstrated that in consequence of this
treatment of the body the soul itself becomes more unjust and more unholy. For so long as
a thing is exempt from its own proper evil, while an evil foreign to it appears in another
subject, let us not allow it to be said that this thing whether it be a soul or anything else is
in danger of being destroyed.</p>
<p>Well, certainly no one will prove that the souls of the dying become more unjust in
consequence of death.” Here follows a passage to prove that even injustice does not destroy
the soul, after which he proceeds,</p>

<pb n="372"/>
<p>“Surely then when the soul cannot be killed and destroyed by its own depravity and its
own evil, hardly will the evil which is charged with the destruction of another thing destroy
a soul or anything else beyond its own appropriate object.</p>
<p>Hardly: at least that is the natural inference.</p>
<p>Hence, as it is destroyed by no evil at all, whether foreign to it or its own, it is clear that
the soul must be always existing, and therefore immortal.</p>
<p>It must.”</p>
<p>If any one will compare this extract with chapters 2 to 6 in the following treatise he
cannot fail to be struck by the similarity of thought and language, although in the latter case
it is more apparent in the original than it can be in translation. The aim of the two writers
is not indeed identical: Chrysostom’s object is to prove that nothing can really injure a man
except sin—depravity of soul—Plato begins by proving this, and proceeds to maintain that
if even that which corrupts the soul cannot actually destroy it the soul must be imperishable.
They employ the same argument, only Plato carries it a step further than Chrysostom.</p>

<head>A TREATISE
TO PROVE THAT NO ONE CAN HARM THE MAN
WHO DOES NOT INJURE HIMSELF.</head>
<p>1. I know well that to coarse-minded persons, who are greedy in the pursuit of present
things, and are nailed to earth, and enslaved to physical pleasure, and have no strong hold
upon spiritual ideas, this treatise will be of a strange and paradoxical kind: and they will
laugh immoderately, and condemn me for uttering incredible things from the very outset
of my theme. Nevertheless, I shall not on this account desist from my promise, but for this
very reason shall proceed with great earnestness to the proof of what I have undertaken.
For if those who take that view of my subject will please not to make a clamour and disturbance,
but wait to the end of my discourse, I am sure that they will take my side, and condemn
themselves, finding that they have been deceived hitherto, and will make a recantation, and
apology, and crave pardon for the mistaken opinion which they held concerning these
matters, and will express great gratitude to me, as patients do to physicians, when they have
been relieved from the disorders which lay seige to their body. For do not tell me of the
judgment which is prevailing in your mind at the present time, but wait to hear the contention
of my arguments and then you will be able to record an impartial verdict without being
hindered by ignorance from forming a true judgment. For even judges in secular causes, if
they see the first orator pouring forth a mighty torrent of words and overwhelming everything
with his speech do not venture to record their decision without having patiently listened to
the other speaker who is opposed to him; and even if the remarks of the first speaker seem
to be just to an unlimited extent, they reserve an unprejudiced hearing for the second. In
fact the special merit of judges consists in ascertaining with all possible accuracy what each
side has to allege and then bringing forward their own judgment.</p>
<p>Now in the place of an orator we have the common assumption of mankind which in
the course of ages has taken deep root in the minds of the multitude, and declaims to the
following effect throughout the world. “All things” it says “have been turned upside down,
the human race is full of much confusion and many are they who every day are being
wronged, insulted, subjected to violence and injury, the weak by the strong, the poor by the
rich: and as it is impossible to number the waves of the sea, so is it impossible to reckon the
multitude of those who are the victims of intrigue, insult, and suffering; and neither the
correction of law, nor the fear of being brought to trial, nor anything else can arrest this
pestilence and disorder, but the evil is increasing every day, and the groans, and lamentations,
and weeping of the sufferers are universal; and the judges who are appointed to reform such

<pb n="374"/>
evils, themselves intensify the tempest, and inflame the disorder, and hence many of the
more senseless and despicable kind, seized with a new kind of frenzy, accuse the providence
of God, when they see the forbearing man often violently seized, racked, and oppressed,
and the audacious, impetuous, low and low-born man waxing rich, and invested with authority,
and becoming formidable to many, and inflicting countless troubles upon the more
moderate, and this perpetrated both in town and country, and desert, on sea and land. This
discourse of ours of necessity comes in by way of direct opposition to what has been alleged,
maintaining a contention which is new, as I said at the beginning, and contrary to opinion,
yet useful and true, and profitable to those who will give heed to it and be persuaded by it;
for what I undertake is to prove (only make no commotion) that no one of those who are
wronged is wronged by another, but experiences this injury at his own hands.</p>
<p>2. But in order to make my argument plainer, let us first of all enquire what injustice is,
and of what kind of things the material of it is wont to be composed; also what human virtue
is, and what it is which ruins it; and further what it is which seems to ruin it but really does
not. For instance (for I must complete my argument by means of examples) each thing is
subject to one evil which ruins it; iron to rust, wool to moth, flocks of sheep to wolves. The
virtue of wine is injured when it ferments and turns sour: of honey when it loses its natural
sweetness, and is reduced to a bitter juice. Ears of corn are ruined by mildew and drought,
and the fruit, and leaves, and branches of vines by the mischievous host of locusts, other
trees by the caterpillar, and irrational creatures by diseases of various kinds: and not to
lengthen the list by going through all possible examples, our own flesh is subject to fevers,
and palsies, and a crowd of other maladies. As then each one of these things is liable to that
which ruins its virtue, let us now consider what it is which injures the human race, and what
it is which ruins the virtue of a human being. Most men think that there are divers things
which have this effect; for I must mention the erroneous opinions on the subject, and, after
confuting them, proceed to exhibit that which really does ruin our virtue: and to demonstrate
clearly that no one could inflict this injury or bring this ruin upon us unless we betrayed
ourselves. The multitude then having erroneous opinions imagine that there are many different
things which ruin our virtue: some say it is poverty, others bodily disease, others loss
of property, others calumny, others death and they are perpetually bewailing and lamenting
these things: and whilst they are commiserating the sufferers and shedding tears they excitedly
exclaim to one another “What a calamity has befallen such and such a man! he has been
deprived of all his fortune at a blow.” Of another again one will say: “such and such a man
has been attacked by severe sickness and is despaired of by the physicians in attendance.”
Some bewail and lament the inmates of the prison, some those who have been expelled from
their country and transported to the land of exile, others those who have been deprived of
their freedom, others those who have been seized and made captives by enemies, others
those who have been drowned, or burnt, or buried by the fall of a house, but no one mourns

<pb n="375"/>
those who are living in wickedness: on the contrary, which is worse than all, they often
congratulate them, a practice which is the cause of all manner of evils. Come then (only, as
I exhorted you at the outset, do not make a commotion), let me prove that none of the things
which have been mentioned injure the man who lives soberly, nor can ruin his virtue. For
tell me if a man has lost his all either at the hands of calumniators or of robbers, or has been
stripped of his goods by knavish servants, what harm has the loss done to the virtue of the
man?</p>
<p>But if it seems well let me rather indicate in the first place what is the virtue of a man,
beginning by dealing with the subject in the case of existences of another kind so as to make
it more intelligible and plain to the majority of readers.</p>
<p>3. What then is the virtue of a horse? is it to have a bridle studded with gold and girths
to match, and a band of silken threads to fasten the housing, and clothes wrought in divers
colours and gold tissue, and head gear studded with jewels, and locks of hair plaited with
gold cord? or is it to be swift and strong in its legs, and even in its paces, and to have hoofs
suitable to a well bred horse, and courage fitted for long journies and warfare, and to be able
to behave with calmness in the battle field, and if a rout takes place to save its rider? Is it not
manifest that these are the things which constitute the virtue of the horse, not the others?
Again, what should you say was the virtue of asses and mules? is it not the power of carrying
burdens with contentment, and accomplishing journies with ease, and having hoofs like
rock? Shall we say that their outside trappings contribute anything to their own proper virtue?
By no means. And what kind of vine shall we admire? one which abounds in leaves and
branches, or one which is laden with fruit? or what kind of virtue do we predicate of an
olive? is it to have large boughs, and great luxuriance of leaves, or to exhibit an abundance
of its proper fruit dispersed over all parts of the tree? Well, let us act in the same way in the
case of human beings also: let us determine what is the virtue of man, and let us regard that
alone as an injury, which is destructive to it. What then is the virtue of man? not riches that
thou shouldest fear poverty: nor health of body that thou shouldest dread sickness, nor the
opinion of the public, that thou shouldest view an evil reputation with alarm, nor life simply
for its own sake, that death should be terrible to thee: nor liberty that thou shouldest avoid
servitude: but carefulness in holding true doctrine, and rectitude in life. Of these things not
even the devil himself will be able to rob a man, if he who possesses them guards them with
the needful carefulness: and that most malicious and ferocious demon is aware of this. For
this cause also he robbed Job of his substance, not to make him poor, but that he might force
him into uttering some blasphemous speech; and he tortured his body, not to subject him
to infirmity, but to upset the virtue of his soul. But nevertheless when he had set all his
devices in motion, and turned him from a rich man into a poor one (that calamity which
seems to us the most terrible of all), and had made him childless who was once surrounded
by many children, and had scarified his whole body more cruelly than the executioners do

<pb n="376"/>
in the public tribunals (for their nails do not lacerate the sides of those who fall into their
hands so severely as the gnawing of the worms lacerated his body), and when he had fastened
a bad reputation upon him (for Job’s friends who were present with him said “thou hast not
received the chastisement which thy sins deserve,” and directed many words of accusation
against him), and after he had not merely expelled him from city and home and transferred
him to another city, but had actually made the dunghill serve as his home and city; after all
this, he not only did him no damage but rendered him more glorious by the designs which
he formed against him. And he not only failed to rob him of any of his possessions although
he had robbed him of so many things, but he even increased the wealth of his virtue. For
after these things he enjoyed greater confidence inasmuch as he had contended in a more
severe contest. Now if he who underwent such sufferings, and this not at the hand of man,
but at the hand of the devil who is more wicked than all men, sustained no injury, which of
those persons who say such and such a man injured and damaged me will have any defence
to make in future? For if the devil who is full of such great malice, after having set all his
instruments in motion, and discharged all his weapons, and poured out all the evils incident
to man, in a superlative degree upon the family and the person of that righteous man nevertheless
did him no injury, but as I was saying rather profited him: how shall certain be able
to accuse such and such a man alleging that they have suffered injury at their hands, not at
their own?</p>
<p>4. What then? some one will say, did he not inflict injury on Adam, and upset him, and
cast him out of paradise? No: he did it not, but the cause was the listlessness of him who
was injured, and his want of temperance and vigilance. For he who applied such powerful
and manifold devices and yet was not able to subdue Job, how could he by inferior means
have mastered Adam, had not Adam betrayed himself through his own listlessness? What
then? Has not he been injured who has been exposed to slander, and suffered confiscation
of his property, having been deprived of all his goods, and is thrown out of his patrimony,
and struggles with extreme poverty? No! he has not been injured, but has even profited, if
he be sober. For, tell me, what harm did this do the apostles? Were they not continually
struggling with hunger, and thirst and nakedness? And this was the very reason why they
were so illustrious, and distinguished, and won for themselves much help from God. Again
what harm was done to Lazarus by his disease, and sores, and poverty and dearth of protectors?
Were they not the reasons why garlands of victory were more abundantly woven for
him? Or what harm was done to Joseph by his getting evil reported of, both in his own land,
and in the land of strangers for he was supposed to be both an adulterer and fornicator: or
what harm did servitude do him or expatriation? Is it not specially on account of these things
that we regard him with admiration and astonishment? And why do I speak of removal into
a foreign land, and poverty, and evil report, and bondage? For what harm did death itself
inflict on Abel, although it was a violent and untimely death, and perpetrated by a brother’s

<pb n="377"/>
hand? Is not this the reason why his praise is sounded throughout the whole world? Seest
thou how the discourse has demonstrated even more than it promised? For not only has it
disclosed the fact that no one is injured by anybody, but also that they who take heed to
themselves derive the greater gain (from such assaults). What is the purpose then it will be
said of penalties and punishments? What is the purpose of hell? What is the purpose of such
great threatenings, if no one is either injured or injures? What is it thou sayest? Why dost
thou confuse the argument? For I did not say that no one injures, but that no one is injured.
And how is it possible, you will say, for no one to be injured when many are committing
injury? In the way which I indicated just now. For Joseph’s brethren did indeed injure him,
yet he himself was not injured: and Cain laid snares for Abel, yet he himself was not ensnared.
This is the reason why there are penalties and punishments. For God does not abolish penalties
on account of the virtue of those who suffer; but he ordains punishments on account
of the malice of those who do wickedly. For although they who are evil entreated become
more illustrious in consequence of the designs formed against them, this is not due to the
intention of those who plan the designs, but to the courage of those who are the victims of
them. Wherefore for the latter the rewards of philosophy are made ready and prepared, for
the former the penalties of wickedness. Hast thou been deprived of thy money? Read the
word “Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither.”888 And
add to this the apostolic saying “for we brought nothing into this world; it is certain we can
carry nothing out.”889 Art thou evil reported of, and have some men loaded thee with
countless abuse? Remember that passage where it is said “Woe unto you when all men shall
speak well of you”890 and “rejoice ye and leap for joy when they shall cast upon you an evil
name.”891 Hast thou been transported into the land of exile? Consider that thou hast not
here a fatherland, but that if thou wilt be wise thou art bidden to regard the whole world as
a strange country. Or hast thou been given over to a sore disease? quote the apostolic saying
“the more our outward man decayeth, so much the more is the inward man renewed day
by day.”892 Has any one suffered a violent death? consider the case of John, his head cut off
in prison, carried in a charger, and made the reward of a harlot’s dancing. Consider the recompense
which is derived from these things: for all these sufferings when they are unjustly
inflicted by any one on another, expiate sins, and work righteousness. So great is the advantage
of them in the case of those who bear them bravely.</p>

<pb n="378"/>
<p>5. When then neither loss of money, nor slander, nor railing, nor banishment, nor diseases,
nor tortures, nor that which seems more formidable than all, namely death, harms
those who suffer them, but rather adds to their profit, whence can you prove to me that any
one is injured when he is not injured at all from any of these things? For I will endeavour
to prove the reverse, showing that they who are most injured and insulted, and suffer the
most incurable evils are the persons who do these things. For what could be more miserable
than the condition of Cain, who dealt with his brother in this fashion? what more pitiable
than that of Phillip’s wife who beheaded John? or the brethren of Joseph who sold him away,
and transported him into the land of exile? or the devil who tortured Job with such great
calamities? For not only on account of his other iniquities, but at the same time also for this
assault he will pay no trifling penalty. Dost thou see how here the argument has proved even
more than was proposed, shewing that those who are insulted not only sustain no harm
from these assaults, but that the whole mischief recoils on the head of those who contrive
them? For since neither wealth nor freedom, nor life in our native land nor the other things
which I have mentioned, but only right actions of the soul, constitute the virtue of man,
naturally when the harm is directed against these things, human virtue itself is no wise
harmed. What then? supposing some one does harm the moral condition of the soul? Even
then if a man suffers damage, the damage does not come from another but proceeds from
within, and from the man himself. “How so,” do you say? When any one having been beaten
by another, or deprived of his goods, or having endured some other grievous insult, utters
a blasphemous speech, he certainly sustains a damage thereby, and a very great one, nevertheless
it does not proceed from him who has inflicted the insult, but from his own littleness
of soul. For what I said before I will now repeat, no man if he be infinitely wicked could attack
any one more wickedly or more bitterly than that revengeful demon who is implacably
hostile to us, the devil: but yet this cruel demon had not power to upset or overthrow him
who lived before the law, and before the time of grace, although he discharged so many and
such bitter weapons against him from all quarters. Such is the force of nobility of soul. And
what shall I say of Paul? Did he not suffer so many distresses that even to make a list of them
is no easy matter? He was put in prison, loaded with chains, dragged hither and hither,
scourged by the Jews, stoned, lacerated on the back not only by thongs, but also by rods, he
was immersed in the sea, oftentimes beset by robbers, involved in strife with his own
countrymen, continually assailed both by foes and by acquaintance, subjected to countless
intrigues, struggling with hunger and nakedness, undergoing other frequent and lasting
mischances and afflictions: and why need I mention the greater part of them? he was dying
every day: but yet, although subjected to so many and such grievous sufferings, he not only
uttered no blasphemous word, but rejoiced over these things and gloried in them: and one
time he says “I rejoice in my sufferings,”893 and then again “not only this but we also glory
<note type="footnote">893 Col. i. 24.</note>

<pb n="379"/>
in afflictions.”894 If then he rejoiced and gloried when suffering such great troubles what
excuse will you have, and what defence will you make if you blaspheme when you do not
undergo the smallest fraction of them.</p>
<p>6. But I am injured in other ways, one will say, and even if I do not blaspheme, yet when
I am robbed of my money I am disabled from giving alms. This is a mere pretext and pretence.
For if you grieve on this account know certainly that poverty is no bar to almsgiving. For
even if you are infinitely poor you are not poorer than the woman who possessed only a
handful of meal,895 and the one who had only two mites,896 each of whom having spent all
her substance upon those who were in need was an object of surpassing admiration: and
such great poverty was no hindrance to such great lovingkindness, but the alms bestowed
from the two mites was so abundant and generous as to eclipse all who had riches, and in
wealth of intention and superabundance of zeal to surpass those who cast in much coin.
Wherefore even in this matter thou art not injured but rather benefitted, receiving by means
of a small contribution rewards more glorious than they who put down large sums. But
since, if I were to say these things for ever, sensuous characters which delight to grovel in
worldly things, and revel in present things would not readily endure parting from the fading
flowers (for such are the pleasant things of this life) or letting go its shadows: but the better
sort of men indeed cling to both the one and the other, while the more pitiable and abject
cling more strongly to the former than to the latter, come let us897 strip off the pleasant and
showy masks which hide the base and ugly countenance of these things, and let us expose
the foul deformity of the harlot. For such is the character of a life of this kind which is devoted
to luxury, and wealth and power: it is foul and ugly and full of much abomination, disagreeable
and burdensome, and charged with bitterness. For this indeed is the special feature in
this life which deprives those who are captivated by it of every excuse, that although it is the
aim of their longings and endeavours, yet is it filled with much annoyance and bitterness,
and teems with innumerable evils, dangers, bloodshed, precipices, crags, murders, fears and
tremblings, envy and ill-will, and intrigue, perpetual anxiety and care, and derives no profit,
and produces no fruit from these great evils save punishment and revenge, and incessant
torment. But although this is its character it seems to be to most men an object of ambition,
and eager contention, which is a sign of the folly of those who are captivated by it, not of
the blessedness of the thing itself. Little children indeed are eager and excited about toys

and cannot take notice of the things which become full grown men. There is an excuse for
them on account of their immaturity: but these others are debarred from the right of defence,
because, although of full age they are childish in disposition, and more foolish than children
in their manner of life.</p>
<p>Now tell me why is wealth an object of ambition? For it is necessary to start from this
point, because to the majority of those who are afflicted with this grievous malady it seems
to be more precious than health and life, and public reputation, and good opinion, and
country, and household, and friends, and kindred and everything else. Moreover the flame
has ascended to the very clouds: and this fierce heat has taken possession of land and sea.
Nor is there any one to quench this fire: but all people are engaged in stirring it up, both
those who have been already caught by it, and those who have not yet been caught, in order
that they may be captured. And you may see every one, husband and wife, household slave,
and freeman, rich and poor, each according to his ability carrying loads which supply much
fuel to this fire by day and night: loads not of wood or faggots (for the fire is not of that
kind), but loads of souls and bodies, of unrighteousness and iniquity. For such is the material
of which a fire of this kind is wont to be kindled. For those who have riches place no
limit anywhere to this monstrous passion, even if they compass the whole world: and the
poor press on to get in advance of them, and a kind of incurable craze, and unrestrainable
frenzy and irremediable disease possesses the souls of all. And this affection has conquered
every other kind and thrust it away expelling it from the soul: neither friends nor kindred
are taken into account: and why do I speak of friends and kindred? not even wife and children
are regarded, and what can be dearer to man than these? but all things are dashed to the
ground and trampled underfoot, when this savage and inhuman mistress has laid hold of
the souls of all who are taken captive by her. For as an inhuman mistress, and harsh tyrant,
and savage barbarian, and public and expensive prostitute she debases and exhausts and
punishes with innumerable dangers and torments those who have chosen to be in bondage
to her; and yet although she is terrible and harsh, and fierce and cruel, and has the face of
a barbarian, or rather of a wild beast, fiercer than a wolf or a lion, she seems to those who
have been taken captive by her gentle and loveable, and sweeter than honey. And although
she forges swords and weapons against them every day, and digs pitfalls and leads them to
precipices and crags and weaves endless snares of punishment for them, yet is she supposed
to make these things objects of ambition to those who have been made captive, and those
who are desiring to be captured. And just as a sow delights and revels in wallowing in the
ditch and mire, and beetles delight in perpetually crawling over dung; even so they who are
captivated by the love of money are more miserable than these creatures. For the abomination
is greater in this case, and the mire more offensive: for they who are addicted to this passion
imagine that much pleasure is derived from it: which does not arise from the nature of the
thing, but of the understanding which is afflicted with such an irrational taste. And this taste

<pb n="381"/>
is worse in their case than in that of brutes: for as with the mire and the dung the cause of
pleasure is not in them, but in the irrational nature of the creatures who plunge into it; even
so count it to be in the case of human beings.</p>
<p>7. And how might we cure those who are thus disposed? It would be possible if they
would open their ears to us, and unfold their heart, and receive our words. For it is impossible
to turn and divert the irrational animals from their unclean habit; for they are destitute of
reason: but this the gentlest of all tribes, honoured by reason and speech, I mean human
nature, might, if it chose, readily and easily be released from the mire and the stench, and
the dung hill and its abomination. For wherefore, O man, do riches seem to thee worthy
such diligent pursuit? Is it on account of the pleasure which no doubt is derived from the
table? or on account of the honour and the escort of those who pay court to thee, because
of thy wealth? is it because thou art able to defend thyself against those who annoy thee,
and to be an object of fear to all? For yon cannot name any other reasons, save pleasure and
flattery, and fear, and the power of taking revenge; for wealth is not generally wont to make
any one wiser, or more self-controlled, or more gentle, or more intelligent, or kind, or benevolent,
or superior to anger, or gluttony or pleasure: it does not train any one to be moderate,
or teach him how to be humble, nor introduce and implant any other piece of virtue in the
soul. Neither could you say for which of these things it deserves to be so diligently sought
and desired. For not only is it ignorant how to plant and cultivate any good thing, but even
if it finds a store of them it mars and stunts and blights them; and some of them it even
uproots, and introduces their opposites, unmeasured licentiousness, unseasonable wrath,
unrighteous anger, pride, arrogance, foolishness. But let me not speak of these; for they who
have been seized by this malady will not endure to hear about virtue and vice, being entirely
abandoned to pleasure and therefore enslaved to it. Come then let us forego for the time
being the consideration of these points, and let us bring forward the others which remain,
and see whether wealth has any pleasure, or any honour: for in my eyes the case is quite the
reverse. And first of all, if you please, let us investigate the meals of rich and poor, and ask
the guests which they are who enjoy the purest and most genuine pleasure; is it they who
recline for a full day on couches, and join breakfast and dinner together, and distend their
stomach, and blunt their senses, and sink the vessel by an overladen cargo of food, and waterlog
the ship, and drench it as in some shipwreck of the body, and devise fetters, and
manacles, and gags, and bind their whole body with the band of drunkenness and surfeit
more grievous than an iron chain, and enjoy no sound pure sleep undisturbed by frightful
dreams, and are more miserable than madmen and introduce a kind of self-imposed demon
into the soul and display themselves as a laughing stock to the gaze of their servants, or
rather to the kinder sort amongst them as a tragical spectacle eliciting tears, and cannot recognize
any of those who are present, and are incapable of speaking or hearing but have to
be carried away from their couches to their bed;—or is it they who are sober and vigilant,

<pb n="382"/>
and limit their eating by their need, and sail with a favourable breeze, and find hunger and
thirst the best relish in their food and drink? For nothing is so conducive to enjoyment and
health as to be hungry and thirsty when one attacks the viands, and to identify satiety with
the simple necessity of food, never overstepping the limits of this, nor imposing a load upon
the body too great for its strength.</p>
<p>8. But if you disbelieve my statement study the physical condition, and the soul of each
class. Are not the bodies vigorous of those who live thus moderately (for do not tell me of
that which rarely happens, although some may be weak from some other circumstance, but
form your judgment from those instances which are of constant occurrence), I say are they
not vigorous, and their senses clear, fulfilling their proper function with much ease?
whereas the bodies of the others are flaccid and softer than wax, and beset with a crowd of
maladies? For gout soon fastens upon them, and untimely palsy, and premature old age,
and headache, and flatulence, and feebleness of digestion, and loss of appetite, and they require
constant attendance of physicians, and perpetual doseing, and daily care. Are these
things pleasurable? tell me. Who of those that know what pleasure really is would say so?
For pleasure is produced when desire leads the way, and fruition follows: now if there is
fruition, but desire is nowhere to be found, the conditions of pleasure fail and vanish. On
this account also invalids, although the most charming food is set before them, partake of
it with a feeling of disgust and sense of oppression: because there is no desire which gives a
keen relish to the enjoyment of it. For it is not the nature of the food, or of the drink, but
the appetite of the eaters which is wont to produce the desire, and is capable of causing
pleasure. Therefore also a certain wise man who had an accurate knowledge of all that concerned
pleasure, and understood how to moralize about these things said “the full soul
mocketh at honeycombs:”898 showing that the conditions of pleasure consist not in the
nature of the meal, but in the disposition of the eaters. Therefore also the prophet recounting
the wonders in Egypt and in the desert mentioned this in connexion with the others “He
satisfied them with honey out of the rock.”899 And yet nowhere does it appear that honey
actually sprang forth for them out of the rock: what then is the meaning of the expression?
Because the people being exhausted by much toil and long travelling, and distressed by great
thirst rushed to the cool spring, their craving for drink serving as a relish, the writer wishing
to describe the pleasures which they received from those fountains called the water honey,
not meaning that the element was converted into honey, but that the pleasure received from
the water rivalled the sweetness of honey, inasmuch as those who partook of it rushed to it
in their eagerness to drink.</p>
<note type="footnote">898 Prov. xxvii. 7. Septuagint.</note>
<note type="footnote">899 Ps. lxxxi. 16.</note>

<pb n="383"/>
<p>Since then these things are so and no one can deny it, however stupid he may be: is it
not perfectly plain that pure, undiluted, and lively pleasure is to be found at the tables of
the poor? whereas at the tables of the rich there is discomfort, and disgust and defilement?
as that wise man has said “even sweet things seem to be a vexation.”900</p>
<p>9. But riches some one will say procure honour for those who possess them, and enable
them to take vengeance on their enemies with ease. And is this a reason, pray, why riches
seem to you desirable and worth contending for;—that they nourish the most dangerous
passion in our nature, leading on anger into action, swelling the empty bubbles of ambition,
and stimulating and urging men to arrogance? Why these are just the very reasons why we
ought resolutely to turn our backs upon riches, because they introduce certain fierce and
dangerous wild beasts into our heart depriving us of the real honour which we might receive
from all, and introducing to deluded men another which is the opposite of this, only painted
over with its colours, and persuading them to fancy that it is the same, when by nature it is
not so, but only seems to be so to the eye. For as the beauty of courtesans, made up as it is
of dyes and pigments, is destitute of real beauty, yet makes a foul and ugly face appear fair
and beautiful to those who are deluded by it when it is not so in reality: even so also riches
force flattery to look like honour. For I beg you not to consider the praises which are openly
bestowed through fear and fawning: for these are only tints and pigments; but unfold the
conscience of each of those who flatter you in this fashion, and inside it you will see countless
accusers declaring against you, and loathing and detesting you more than your bitterest
adversaries and foes. And if ever a change of circumstances should occur which would remove
and expose this mask which fear has manufactured, just as the sun when it emits a hotter
ray than usual discloses the real countenances of those women whom I mentioned, then
you will see clearly that all through the former time you were held in the greatest contempt
by those who paid court to you, and you fancied you were enjoying honour from those who
thoroughly hated you, and in their heart poured infinite abuse upon you, and longed to see
you involved in extreme calamities. For there is nothing like virtue to produce honour,—honour
neither forced nor feigned, nor hidden under a mask of deceit, but real and genuine,
and able to stand the test of hard times.</p>
<p>10. But do you wish to take vengeance on those who have annoyed you? This, as I was
saying just now, is the very reason why wealth ought specially to be avoided. For it prepares
thee to thrust the sword against thyself, and renders thee liable to a heavier account in the
future day of reckoning, and makes thy punishment intolerable. For revenge is so great an
evil that it actually revokes the mercy of God, and cancels the forgiveness of countless sins
which has been already bestowed. For he who received remission of the debt of ten thousand
talents, and after having obtained so great a boon by merely asking for it then made a demand
<note type="footnote">900 Referring to Prov. xxvii. 7.</note>

<pb n="384"/>
of one hundred pence from his fellow servant, a demand, that is, for satisfaction for his
transgression against himself, in his severity towards his fellow servant recorded his own
condemnation; and for this reason and no other he was delivered to the tormentors, and
racked, and required to pay back the ten thousand talents; and he was not allowed the benefit
of any excuse or defence, but suffered the most extreme penalty, having been commanded
to deposit the whole debt which the lovingkindness of God had formerly remitted.901 Is this
then the reason, pray, why wealth is so earnestly pursued by thee, because it so easily conducts
thee into sin of this kind? Nay verily, this is why you ought to abhor it as a foe and an adversary
teeming with countless murders. But poverty, some one will say, disposes men to
be discontented and often also to utter profane words, and condescend to mean actions. It
is not poverty which does this, but littleness of soul: for Lazarus also was poor, aye! very
poor: and besides poverty he suffered from infirmity, a bitterer trial than any form of poverty,
and one which makes poverty more severely felt; and in addition to infirmity there was a
total absence of protectors, and difficulty in finding any to supply his wants, which increased
the bitterness of poverty and infirmity. For each of these things is painful in itself, but when
there are none to minister to the sufferer’s wants, the suffering becomes greater, the flame
more painful, the distress more bitter, the tempest fiercer, the billows stronger, the furnace
hotter. And if one examines the case thoroughly there was yet a fourth trial besides these—the
unconcern and luxury of the rich man who dwelt hard by. And if you would find a fifth
thing, serving as fuel to the flame, you will see quite clearly that he was beset by it. For not
only was that rich man living luxuriously, but twice, and thrice, or rather indeed several
times in the day he saw the poor man: for he had been laid at his gate, being a grievous
spectacle of pitiable distress, and the bare sight of him was sufficient to soften even a heart
of stone: and yet even this did not induce that unmerciful man to assist this case of poverty:
but he had his luxurious table spread, and goblets wreathed with flowers, and pure wine
plentifully poured forth, and grand armies of cooks, and parasites, and flatterers from early
dawn, and troops of singers, cupbearers, and jesters; and he spent all his time in devising
every species of dissipation, and drunkenness, and surfeiting, and in revelling in dress and
feasting and many other things. But although he saw that poor man every day distressed by
grievous hunger and the bitterest infirmity, and the oppression of his many sores, and by
destitution, and the ills which result from these things, he never even gave him a thought:
yet the parasites and the flatterers were pampered even beyond their need; but the poor
man, and he so very poor, and encompassed with so many miseries, was not even vouchsafed
the crumbs which fell from that table, although he greatly desired them: and yet none of
these things injured him, he did not give vent to a bitter word, he did not utter a profane
speech; but like a piece of gold which shines all the more brilliantly when it is purified by
<note type="footnote">901 Matt. xviii. 23–35.</note>

<pb n="385"/>
excessive heat, even so he, although oppressed by these sufferings, was superior to all of
them, and to the agitation which in many cases is produced by them. For if generally
speaking poor men, when they see rich men, are consumed with envy and racked by malicious
ill-will, and deem life not worth living, and this even when they are well supplied with necessary
food, and have persons to minister to their wants; what would the condition of this
poor man have been had he not been very wise and noble hearted, seeing that he was poor
beyond all other poor men, and not only poor, but also infirm, and without any one to
protect or cheer him, and lay in the midst of the city as if in a remote desert, and wasted
away with bitter hunger, and saw all good things being poured upon the rich man as out of
a fountain, and had not the benefit of any human consolation, but lay exposed as a perpetual
meal for the tongues of the dogs, for he was so enfeebled and broken down in body that he
could not scare them away? Dost thou perceive that he who does not injure himself suffers
no evil? for I will again take up the same argument.</p>
<p>11. For what harm was done to this hero by his bodily infirmity? or by the absence of
protectors? or by the coming of the dogs? or the evil proximity of the rich man? or by the
great luxury, haughtiness and arrogance of the latter? Did it enervate him for the contest
on behalf of virtue? Did it ruin his fortitude? Nowhere was he harmed at all, but that multitude
of sufferings, and the cruelty of the rich man, rather increased his strength, and became
the pledge for him of infinite crowns of victory, a means of adding to his rewards, an augmentation
of his recompense, and a promise of an increased requital. For he was crowned
not merely on account of his poverty, or of his hunger or of his sores, or of the dogs licking
them: but because, having such a neighbour as the rich man, and being seen by him every
day, and perpetually overlooked he endured this trial bravely and with much fortitude, a
trial which added no small flame but in fact a very strong one to the fire of poverty, and infirmity
and loneliness.</p>
<p>And, tell me, what was the case of the blessed Paul? for there is nothing to prevent my
making mention of him again. Did he not experience innumerable storms of trial? And in
what respect was he injured by them? Was he not crowned with victory all the more in
consequence,—because he suffered hunger, because he was consumed with cold and nakedness,
because he was often tortured with the scourge, because he was stoned, because he
was cast into the sea? But then some one says he was Paul, and called by Christ. Yet Judas
also was one of the twelve, and he too was called of Christ; but neither his being of the twelve
nor his call profited him, because he had not a mind disposed to virtue. But Paul although
struggling with hunger, and at a loss to procure necessary food, and daily undergoing such
great sufferings, pursued with great zeal the road which leads to heaven: whereas Judas although
he had been called before him, and enjoyed the same advantages as he did, and was
initiated in the highest form of Christian life, and partook of the holy table and that most
awful of sacred feasts, and received such grace as to be able to raise the dead, and cleanse

<pb n="386"/>
the lepers, and cast out devils, and often heard discourses concerning poverty, and spent so
long a time in the company of Christ Himself, and was entrusted with the money of the
poor, so that his passion might be soothed thereby (for he was a thief) even then did not
become any better, although he had been favoured with such great condescension. For since
Christ knew that he was covetous, and destined to perish on account of his love of money
he not only did not demand punishment of him for this at that time, but with a view to
softening down his passion he was entrusted with the money of the poor, that having some
means of appeasing his greed he might be saved from falling into that appalling gulf of sin,
checking the greater evil beforehand by a lesser one.</p>
<p>12. Thus in no case will any one be able to injure a man who does not choose to injure
himself: but if a man is not willing to be temperate, and to aid himself from his own resources
no one will ever be able to profit him. Therefore also that wonderful history of the Holy
Scriptures, as in some lofty, large, and broad picture, has portrayed the lives of the men of
old time, extending the narrative from Adam to the coming of Christ: and it exhibits to you
both those who are upset, and those who are crowned with victory in the contest, in order
that it may instruct you by means of all examples that no one will be able to injure one who
is not injured by himself, even if all the world were to kindle a fierce war against him. For
it is not stress of circumstances, nor variation of seasons, nor insults of men in power, nor
intrigues besetting thee like snow storms, nor a crowd of calamities, nor a promiscuous
collection of all the ills to which mankind is subject, which can disturb even slightly the man
who is brave, and temperate, and watchful; just as on the contrary the indolent and supine
man who is his own betrayer cannot be made better, even with the aid of innumerable
ministrations. This at least was made manifest to us by the parable of the two men, of whom
the one built his house upon the rock, the other upon the sand:902 not that we are to think
of sand and rock, or of a building of stone, and a roof, or of rivers, and rain, and wild winds,
beating against the buildings, but we are to extract virtue and vice as the meaning of these
things, and to perceive from them that no one injures a man who does not injure himself.
Therefore neither the rain although driven furiously along, nor the streams dashing against
it with much vehemence, nor the wild winds beating against it with a mighty rush, shook
the one house in any degree: but it remained undisturbed, unmoved: that thou mightest
understand that no trial can agitate the man who does not betray himself. But the house of
the other man was easily swept away, not on account of the force of the trials (for in that
case the other would have experienced the same fate), but on account of his own folly; for
it did not fall because the wind blew upon it, but because it was built upon the sand, that is
to say upon indolence and iniquity. For before that tempest beat upon it, it was weak and
ready to fall. For buildings of that kind, even if no one puts any pressure on them, fall to
<note type="footnote">902 Matt. vii. 24, etc.</note>

<pb n="387"/>
pieces of themselves, the foundation sinking and giving way in every direction. And just as
cobwebs part asunder, although no strain is put upon them, but adamant remains unshaken
even when it is struck: even so also they who do not injure themselves become stronger,
even if they receive innumerable blows; but they who betray themselves, even if there is no
one to harass them, fall of themselves, and collapse and perish. For even thus did Judas
perish, not only having been unassailed by any trial of this kind, but having actually enjoyed
the benefit of much assistance.</p>
<p>13. Would you like me to illustrate this argument in the case of whole nations? What
great forethought was bestowed upon the Jewish nation! was not the whole visible creation
arranged with a view to their service? was not a new and strange method of life introduced
amongst them? For they had not to send down to a market, and so they had the benefit of
things which are sold for money without paying any price for them: neither did they cleave
furrows nor drag a plough, nor harrow the ground, nor cast in seed, nor had they need of
rain and wind, and annual seasons, nor sunshine, nor phases of the moon, nor climate, nor
anything of that kind; they prepared no threshing floor, they threshed no grain, they used
no winnowing fan for separating the grain from the chaff, they turned no mill-stone, they
built no oven, they brought neither wood nor fire into the house, they needed no baker’s
art, they handled no spade, they sharpened no sickle, they required no other art, I mean of
weaving or building or supplying shoes: but the word of God was everything to them. And
they had a table prepared off hand, free of all toil and labour. For such was the nature of the
manna; it was new and fresh, nowhere costing them any trouble, nor straining them by labour.
And their clothes, and shoes, and even their physical frame forgot their natural infirmity:
for the former did not wear out in the course of so long a time nor did their feet swell
although they made such long marches. Of physicians, and medicine, and all other concern
about that kind of art, there was no mention at all amongst them; so completely banished
was infirmity of every kind: for it is said “He brought them out with silver and gold; and
there was not one feeble person among their tribes.”903 But like men who had quitted this
world, and were transplanted to another and a better one, even so did they eat and drink,
neither did the sun’s ray when it waxed hot smite their heads; for the cloud parted them
from the fiery beam, hovering all round them, and serving like a portable shelter for the
whole body of the people. Neither at night did they need a torch to disperse the darkness,
but they had the pillar of fire, a source of unspeakable light, supplying two wants, one by
its shining, the other by directing the course of their journey; for it was not only luminous,
but also conducted that countless host along the wilderness with more certainty than any
human guide. And they journeyed not only upon land but also upon sea as if it had been
dry land; and they made an audacious experiment upon the laws of nature by treading upon
<note type="footnote">903 Ps. cv. 37.</note>

<pb n="388"/>
that angry sea, marching through it as if it had been the hard and resisting surface of a rock;
and indeed when they placed their feet upon it the element became like solid earth, and
gently sloping plains and fields; but when it received their enemies it wrought after the
nature of sea; and to the Israelites indeed it served as a chariot, but to their enemies it became
a grave; conveying the former across with ease, but drowning the latter with great violence.
And the disorderly flood of water displayed the good order and subordination which marks
reasonable and highly intelligent men, fulfilling the part at one time of a guardian, at another
of an executioner, and exhibiting these opposites together on one day. What shall one say
of the rocks which gave forth streams of water? what of the clouds of birds which covered
the whole face of the earth by the number of their carcases? what of the wonders in Egypt?
what of the marvels in the wilderness? what of the triumphs and bloodless victories? for
they subdued those who opposed them like men keeping holiday rather than making war.
And they vanquished their own masters without the use of arms; and overcame those who
fought with them after they left Egypt by means of singing and music; and what they did
was a festival rather than a campaign, a religious ceremony rather than a battle. For all these
wonders took place not merely for the purpose of supplying their need, but also that the
people might preserve more accurately the doctrine which Moses inculcated of the knowledge
of God; and voices proclaiming the presence of their Master were uttered on all sides of
them. For the sea loudly declared this, by becoming a road for them to march upon, and
then turning into sea again: and the waters of the Nile uttered this voice when they were
converted into the nature of blood; and the frogs, and the great army of locusts, and the
caterpillar and blight declared the same thing to all the people; and the wonders in the desert,
the manna, the pillar of fire, the cloud, the quails, and all the other incidents served them
as a book, and writing which could never be effaced, echoing daily in their memory and
resounding in their mind. Nevertheless after such great and remarkable providence, after
all those unspeakable benefits, after such mighty miracles, after care indescribable, after
continual teaching, after instruction by means of speech, and admonition by means of deeds,
after glorious victories, after extraordinary triumphs, after abundant supply of food, after
the plentiful production of water, after the ineffable glory with which they were invested in
the eyes of the human race, being ungrateful and senseless they worshipped a calf, and paid
reverence to the head of a bull, even when the memorials of God’s benefits in Egypt were
fresh in their minds, and they were still in actual enjoyment of many more.</p>
<p>14. But the Ninevites, although a barbarous and foreign people who had never participated
in any of these benefits, small or great, neither words, nor wonders, nor works, when
they saw a man who had been saved from shipwreck, who had never associated with them
before, but appeared then for the first time, enter their city and say “yet three days and
Nineveh shall be overthrown,”904 were so converted and reformed by the mere sound of
<note type="footnote">904 Jonah iii. 4.</note>

<pb n="389"/>
these words, and putting away their former wickedness, advanced in the direction of virtue
by the path of repentance, that they caused the sentence of God to be revoked, and arrested
the threatened disturbance of their city, and averted the heaven-sent wrath, and were delivered
from every kind of evil. “For,” we read, “God saw that every man turned from his
evil way, and was converted to the Lord.”905 How turned? I ask. Although their wickedness
was great, their iniquity unspeakable, their moral sores difficult to heal, which was plainly
shown by the prophet when he said “their wickedness ascended even unto the heaven:”906
indicating by the distance of the place the magnitude of their wickedness; nevertheless such
great iniquity which was piled up to such a height as to reach even to the heaven, all this in
the course of three days in a brief moment of time through the effect of a few words which
they heard from the mouth of one man and he an unknown shipwrecked stranger they so
thoroughly abolished, removed out of sight, and put away, as to have the happiness of
hearing the declaration “God saw that every one turned from his evil way, and He repented
of the evil which God said He would do them.” Seest thou that he who is temperate and
watchful not only suffers no injury at the hands of man, but even turns back Heaven-sent
wrath? whereas he who betrays himself and harms himself by his own doing, even if he receives
countess benefits, reaps no great advantage. So, at least, the Jews were not profited
by those great miracles, nor on the other hand were the Ninevites harmed by having no
share in them; but inasmuch as they were inwardly well-disposed, having laid hold of a
slight opportunity they became better, barbarians and foreigners though they were, ignorant
of all divine revelation, and dwelling at a distance from Palestine.</p>
<p>15. Again, I ask, was the virtue of the “three children” corrupted by the troubles which
beset them? Whilst they were still young, mere youths, of immature age, did they not undergo
that grievous affliction of captivity? had they not to make a long journey from home, and
when they had arrived in the foreign country were they not cut off from fatherland and
home and temple, and altar and sacrifices, and offerings, and drink offerings, and even the
singing of psalms? For not only were they debarred from their home, but as a consequence
from many forms of worship also. Were they not given up into the hands of barbarians,
wolves rather than men? and, most painful calamity of all, when they had been banished
into so distant and barbarous a country, and were suffering such a grievous captivity were
they not without teacher, without prophets, without ruler? “for,” it is written, “there is no
ruler, nor prophet, nor governor, nor place for offering before Thee and finding mercy.”907
Yea moreover they were cast into the royal palace, as upon some cliff and crag, and a sea
full of rocks and reefs, being compelled to sail over that angry sea without a pilot or signal

<pb n="390"/>
man, or crew, or sails; and they were cooped up in the royal court as in a prison. For inasmuch
as they knew spiritual wisdom, and were superior to worldly things, and despised all human
pride and made the wings of their soul soar upwards, they counted their sojourn there as
an aggravation of their trouble. For had they been outside the court, and dwelling in a private
house they would have enjoyed more independence: but having been cast into that prison
(for they deemed the splendour of the palace no better than a prison, no safer than a place
of rocks and crags) they were straightway subjected to cruel embarrassment. For the king
commanded them to be partakers of his own table, a luxurious, unclean and profane table,
a thing which was forbidden them, and seemed more terrible than death; and they were
lonely men hemmed in like lambs amongst so many wolves. And they were constrained to
choose between being consumed by famine or rather led off to execution, and tasting of
forbidden meats. What then did these youths do, forlorn as they were, captives, strangers,
slaves of those who commanded these things. They did not consider that this strait or the
absolute power of him who possessed the state sufficed to justify their compliance; but they
employed every device and expedient to enable them to avoid the sin, although they were
abandoned on every side. For they could not influence men by money: how should they,
being captives? nor by friendship and social intercourse? how should they being strangers?
nor could they get the better of them by any exertion of power: how was it possible being
slaves? nor master them by force of numbers: how could they being only three? Therefore
they approached the eunuch who possessed the necessary authority, and persuaded him by
their arguments. For when they saw him fearful and trembling, and in an agony of alarm
concerning his own safety, and the dread of death which agitated his soul was intolerable:
“for I fear” said he “my lord the king, lest he should see your countenances sadder than the
children which are of your sort and so shall ye endanger my head to the king,”908 having
released him from this fear they persuaded him to grant them the favour. And inasmuch as
they brought to the work all the strength which they had, God also henceforth contributed
his strength to it. For it was not God’s doing only that they achieved those things for the
sake of which they were to receive a reward, but the beginning and starting point was from
their own purpose, and having manifested that to be noble and brave, they won for themselves
the help of God, and so accomplished their aim.</p>
<p>16. Dost thou then perceive that if a man does not injure himself, no one else will be
able to harm him? Behold at least youthfulness, and captivity and destitution, and removal
into a foreign land, and loneliness, and dearth of protectors, and a stern command, and
great fear of death assailing the mind of the eunuch, and poverty, and feebleness of numbers,
and dwelling in the midst of barbarians, and having enemies for masters, and surrender
into the hands of the king himself, and separation from all their kindred, and removal from
<note type="footnote">908 Dan. i. 10.</note>

<pb n="391"/>
priests and prophets, and from all others who cared for them, and the cessation of drink
offerings and sacrifices, and loss of the temple and psalmody, and yet none of these things
harmed them; but they had more renown then than when they enjoyed these things in their
native land. And after they had accomplished this task first and had wreathed their brows
with the glorious garland of victory, and had kept the law even in a foreign land, and trampled
under foot the tyrant’s command, and overcome fear of the avenger, and yet received no
harm from any quarter, as if they had been quietly living at home and enjoying the benefit
of all those things which I mentioned, after they had thus fearlessly accomplished their work
they were again summoned to other contests. And again they were the same men; and they
were subjected to a more severe trial than the former one, and a furnace was kindled, and
they were confronted by the barbarian army in company with the king: and the whole Persian
force was set in motion and everything was devised which tended to put deceit or constraint
upon them: divers kinds of music, and various forms of punishment, and threats, and what
they saw on every side of them was alarming, and the words which they heard were more
alarming than what they saw; nevertheless inasmuch as they did not betray themselves, but
made the most of their own strength, they never sustained any kind of damage: but even
won for themselves more glorious crowns of victory than before. For Nabuchadonosor
bound them and cast them into the furnace, yet he burnt them not, but rather benefited
them, and rendered them more illustrious. And although they were deprived of temple (for
I will repeat my former remarks) and altar, and fatherland, and priests and prophets, although
they were in a foreign and barbarous country, in the very midst of the furnace, surrounded
by all that mighty host, the king himself who wrought this looking on, they set up a glorious
trophy, and won a notable victory, having sung that admirable and extraordinary hymn
which from that day to this has been sung throughout the world and will continue to be
sung to future generations.</p>
<p>Thus then when a man does not injure himself, he cannot possibly be hurt by another:
for I will not cease harping constantly upon this saying. For if captivity, and bondage, and
loneliness and loss of country and all kindred and death, and burning, and a great army and
a savage tyrant could not do any damage to the innate virtue of the three children captives,
bondmen, strangers though they were in a foreign land, but the enemy’s assault became to
them rather the occasion of greater confidence: what shall be able to harm the temperate
man? There is nothing, even should he have the whole world in arms against him. But, some
one may say, in their case God stood beside them, and plucked them out of the flame. Certainly
He did; and if thou wilt play thy part to the best of thy power, the help which God
supplies will assuredly follow.</p>
<p>17. Nevertheless the reason why I admire those youths, and pronounce them blessed,
and enviable, is not because they tramped on the flame, and vanquished the force of the
fire: but because they were bound, and cast into the furnace, and delivered to the fire for

<pb n="392"/>
the sake of true doctrine. For this it was which constituted the completeness of their triumph,
and the wreath of victory was placed on their brows as soon as they were cast into the furnace
and before the issue of events it began to be weaved for them from the moment that they
uttered those words which they spoke with much boldness and freedom of speech to the
king when they were brought into his presence. “We have no need to answer thee concerning
this thing: for our God in Heaven whom we serve is able to rescue us out of the burning
fiery furnace: and He will deliver us out of thy hands, O King. But if not, be it known unto
thee, O King, that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast
set up.”909 After the utterance of these words I proclaimed them conquerors; after these
words having grasped the prize of victory, they hastened on to the glorious crown of martyrdom,
following up the confession which they made through their words with the confession
made through their deeds. But if when they had been cast into it, the fire had respect
for their bodies, and undid their bonds, and suffered them to go down into it without fear,
and forgot its natural force, so that the furnace of fire became as a fountain of cool water,
this marvel was the effect of God’s grace and of the divine wonder-working power. Yet the
heroes themselves even before these things took place, as soon as they set foot in the flames
had erected their trophy, and won their victory, and put on their crown, and had been proclaimed
conquerors both in Heaven and on earth, and so far as they were concerned nothing
was wanting for their renown. What then wouldst thou have to say to these things? Hast
thou been driven into exile, and expelled from thy country? Behold so also were they. Hast
thou suffered captivity, and become the servant of barbarian masters. Well! this also thou
wilt find befell these men. But thou hast no one present there to regulate thy state nor to
advise or instruct thee? Well! of attention of this kind these men were destitute. Or thou
hast been bound, burned, put to death? for thou canst not tell me of anything more painful
than these things. Yet lo! these men having gone through them all, were made more glorious
by each one of them, yea more exceedingly illustrious, and increased the store of their
treasures in Heaven. And the Jews indeed who had both temple, and altar, and ark and
cherubim, and mercy-seat, and veil, and an infinite multitude of priests, and daily services,
and morning and evening sacrifices, and continually heard the voices of the prophets, both
living and departed, sounding in their ears, and carried about with them the recollection of
the wonders which were done in Egypt, and in the wilderness, and all the rest, and turned
the story of these things over in their hands, and had them inscribed upon their door posts
and enjoyed the benefit at that time of much supernatural power and every other kind of
help were yet no wise profited, but rather damaged, having set up idols in the temple itself,
and having sacrificed their sons and daughters under trees, and in almost every part of the
country in Palestine having offered those unlawful and accursed sacrifices, and perpetrated
<note type="footnote">909 Dan. iii. 16–18.</note>

<pb n="393"/>
countless other deeds yet more monstrous. But these men although in the midst of a barbarous
and hostile land, having their occupation in a tyrant’s house, deprived of all that care
of which I have been speaking, led away to execution, and subjected to burning, not only
suffered no harm there from small or great, but became the more illustrious. Knowing then
these things, and collecting instances of the like kind from the inspired divine Scriptures
(for it is possible to find many such examples in the case of various other persons) we deem
that neither a difficulty arising from seasons or events, nor compulsion and force, nor the
arbitrary authority of potentates furnish a sufficient excuse for us when we transgress. I will
now conclude my discourse by repeating what I said at the beginning, that if any one be
harmed and injured he certainly suffers this at his own hands, not at the hands of others
even if there be countless multitudes injuring and insulting him: so that if he does not suffer
this at his own hands, not all the creatures who inhabit the whole earth and sea if they
combined to attack him would be able to hurt one who is vigilant and sober in the Lord.
Let us then, I beseech you, be sober and vigilant at all times, and let us endure all painful
things bravely that we may obtain those everlasting and pure blessings in Christ Jesus our
Lord, to whom be glory and power, now and ever throughout all ages. Amen.</p>

<p>LETTERS OF ST. CHRYSOSTOM TO OLYMPIAS</p>
<p>TRANSLATED WITH INTRODUCTION AND NOTES BY
REV. W. R. W. STEPHENS, M.A.,
PREBENDARY OF CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL, AND RECTOR OF WOOLBEDING,
SUSSEX.</p>

<pb n="395"/>
<head>INTRODUCTION TO THE LETTERS TO OLYMPIAS.</head>
<p>The deaconess Olympias to whom seventeen of Chrysostom’s extant letters are addressed
was the most eminent of his female friends. She belonged to a Pagan family of high rank,
and was born about 368. Her father Seleucus who was a count of the Empire died when she
was a young girl and she was brought up under the guardianship of an uncle Procopius,
who has a devout Christian and a friend of Gregory of Nazianzus. Gregory took great interest
in her, speaking of her in his letters as “his own Olympias” and delighting to be addressed
by her as “father.” Her governess Theodosia, sister of St. Amphilochius of Iconium, was a
woman whom Gregory exhorted her to imitate as the very pattern of Christian goodness.
The orphan girl had great personal beauty, and was the heiress of a large fortune. Naturally
therefore she had many suitors, and in 384 at the age of sixteen she was wedded to
Nebridius, a young man of high rank and irreproachable character. The marriage however
does not seem to have been a happy one, and perhaps in this fact as well as in the death of
her husband about two years after their union, Olympias saw a divine intimation that she
should not entangle herself again in the worldly cares and anxieties incident to married life.
The Emperor Theodosius wished to unite her to a young Spaniard, Elpidius, a kinsman of
his own, and irritated by her refusal, ordered her property to be confiscated until she should
have attained her thirtieth year, unless she consented to the proposed union. Olympias
however remained inflexible and in a letter of dignified sarcasm thanked the Emperor for
relieving her from a heavy burden. “He could not have conferred a greater blessing upon
her unless he had ordered her wealth to be bestowed upon the Churches and the poor.”
Theodosius perceiving the uselessness, if not regretting the injustice, of his harsh decree,
cancelled it, and left her in the undisturbed enjoyment of her property. Henceforward her
time and wealth were devoted to the service of religion. She ministered to the necessities of
the sick and poor, and supported the work of the Church in Greece, Asia Minor and Syria
with such lavish donations, not only of her money but of her land, that even Chrysostom,
who might be called the great preacher of almsgiving, warned her against indiscriminate
liberality, reminding her that as her wealth was a trust committed to her by God she ought
to be discreet in the management of it. This salutary advice gained him the ill-will of many
avaricious bishops and clergy who had profited, or hoped to profit, by her gifts. She in her
turn requited the Archbishop for his spiritual care by many little feminine attentions to his
bodily wants, especially by seeing that he was supplied with wholesome food, and did not
overstrain his feeble constitution by a too rigid abstinence. She herself however practised
the most austere asceticism, renouncing the luxury of the bath, wearing none but old coarse
clothing, and subjecting herself to severe restrictions in respect of food and sleep.</p>
<p>After the expulsion of Chrysostom from Constantinople 404, through the intrigues of
his enemies, Olympias suffered much from the persecution to which all his followers were

<pb n="396"/>
subjected. She was accused of having been concerned in causing the fire which broke out
immediately after his departure, and destroyed the Cathedral Church and the Senate House.
Her intrepid demeanour before the præfect who tried in vain to frighten her into a confession
of guilt, or induce her to acknowledge Arsacius who had been intruded into the See by an
arbitrary exercise of imperial power, excited general admiration; and the tidings of her
fortitude were a great consolation to the exiled archbishop in the midst of much bodily
suffering, and mental distress. It is not quite certain whether she was driven from Constantinople
or voluntarily retired from it; nor have we any definite information concerning
the remainder of her life.</p>

<head>LETTERS TO OLYMPIAS.</head>
    
<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>to my lady.</head>
<p>The most reverend and divinely favored deaconess Olympias, I John, Bishop, send greeting in
the Lord.</p>
<p>1. Come now let me relieve the wound of thy despondency, and disperse the thoughts
which gather this cloud of care around thee. For what is it which upsets thy mind, and why
art thou sorrowful and dejected? Is it because of the fierce black storm which has overtaken
the Church, enveloping all things in darkness as of a night without a moon, and is growing
to a head every day, travailing to bring forth disastrous shipwrecks, and increasing the ruin
of the world? I know all this as well as you; none shall gainsay it, and if you like I will form
an image of the things now taking place so as to present the tragedy yet more distinctly to
thee. We behold a sea upheaved from the very lowest depths, some sailors floating dead
upon the waves, others engulfed by them, the planks of the ships breaking up, the sails torn
to tatters, the masts sprung, the oars dashed out of the sailors’ hands, the pilots seated on
the deck, clasping their knees with their hands instead of grasping the rudder, bewailing the
hopelessness of their situation with sharp cries and bitter lamentations, neither sky nor sea
clearly visible, but all one deep and impenetrable darkness, so that no one can see his
neighbour, whilst mighty is the roaring of the billows, and monsters of the sea attack the
crews on every side.</p>
<p>But how much further shall I pursue the unattainable? for whatever image of our present
evils I may seek speech shrinks baffled from the attempt. Nevertheless even when I look at
these calamities I do not abandon the hope of better things, considering as I do who the pilot
is in all this—not one who gets the better of the storm by his art, but calms the raging waters
by his rod. But if He does not effect this at the outset and speedily, such is His custom—He
does not at the beginning put down these terrible evils, but when they have increased, and
come to extremities, and most persons are reduced to despair, then He works wondrously,
and beyond all expectation, thus manifesting his own power, and training the patience of
those who undergo these calamities. Do not therefore be cast down. For there is only one
thing, Olympias, which is really terrible, only one real trial, and that is sin; and I have never
ceased continually harping upon this theme; but as for all other things, plots, enmities,
frauds, calumnies, insults, accusations, confiscation, exile, the keen sword of the enemy, the
peril of the deep, warfare of the whole world, or anything else you like to name, they are but
idle tales. For whatever the nature of these things may be they are transitory and perishable,
and operate in a mortal body without doing any injury to the vigilant soul. Therefore the

<pb n="398"/>
blessed Paul, desiring to prove the insignificance both of the pleasures and sorrows relating
to this life, declared the whole truth in one sentence when he said—“For the things which
are seen are temporal.”910 Why then dost thou fear temporal things which pass away like
the stream of a river. For such is the nature of present things whether they be pleasant or
painful. And another prophet compared all human prosperity not to grass, but to another
material even more flimsy, describing the whole of it “as the flower of grass.” For he did not
single out any one part of it, as wealth alone, or luxury alone, or power, or honour; but
having comprised all the things which are esteemed splendid amongst men under the one
designation of glory he said “all the glory of man is as the flower of grass.”911</p>
<p>2. Nevertheless, you will say, adversity is a terrible thing and grievous to be borne. Yet
look at it again compared with another image and then also learn to despise it. For the railings,
and insults, and reproaches, and gibes inflicted by enemies, and their plots are compared
to a worn-out garment, and moth-eaten wool when God says “Fear ye not the reproach of
men, neither be ye afraid of their revilings, for they shall wax old as doth a garment, and
like moth-eaten wool so shall they be consumed.”912 Therefore let none of these things
which are happening trouble thee, but ceasing to invoke the aid of this or that person, and
to run after shadows (for such are human alliances), do thou persistently call upon Jesus,
whom thou servest, merely to bow his head; and in a moment of time all these evils will be
dissolved. But if thou hast already called upon Him, and yet they have not been dissolved,
such is the manner of God’s dealing (for I will resume my former argument); He does not
put down evils at the outset, but when they have grown to a head, when scarcely any form
of the enemy’s malice remains ungratified, then He suddenly converts all things to a state
of tranquillity and conducts them to an unexpected settlement. For He is not only able to
turn as many things as we expect and hope, to good, but many more, yea infinitely more.
Wherefore also Paul saith “now to Him who is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
that we ask or think.”913 Could He not, for example, have prevented the three children at
the outset from falling into trial? But He did not choose to do this, thereby conferring great
pain upon them. Therefore He suffered them to be delivered into the hands of barbarians,
and the furnace to be heated to an immeasurable height and the wrath of the king to blaze
even more fiercely than the furnace, and hands and feet to be bound with great severity and
they themselves to be cast into the fire; and then, when all they who beheld despaired of
their rescue, suddenly, and beyond all hope, the wonder-working power of God, the supreme
artificer, was displayed, and shone forth with exceeding splendour. For the fire was bound,
<note type="footnote">910 2 Cor. iv. 18.</note>

<note type="footnote">912 Is. l. 7, 8.</note>
<note type="footnote">913 Ephes. iii. 20.</note>

<pb n="399"/>
and the bondmen were released; and the furnace became a temple of prayer, a place of
fountains and dew, of higher dignity than a royal court, and the very hairs of their head
prevailed over that all devouring element which gets the better even of iron and stone, and
masters every kind of substance. And a solemn song of universal praise was instituted there
by these holy men inviting every kind of created thing to join in the wondrous melody; and
they uttered hymns of thanksgiving to God for that they had been bound, and also burnt,
as far at least as the malice of their enemies had power; that they had been exiles from their
country, captives deprived of their liberty, wandering outcasts from city and home, sojourners
in a strange and barbarous land; for all this was the outpouring of a grateful heart. And
when the malicious devices of their enemies were perfected (for what further could they
attempt after their death?) and the labours of the heroes were completed, and the garland
of victory was woven, and their rewards were prepared and nothing more was wanting for
their renown; then at last their calamities were brought to an end, and he who caused the
furnace to be kindled, and delivered them over to that great punishment, became himself
the panegyrist of those holy heroes, and the herald of God’s marvellous deed, and everywhere
throughout the world issued letters full of reverent praise, recording what had taken place,
and becoming the faithful herald of the miracles wrought by the wonder-working God. For
inasmuch as he had been an enemy and adversary what he wrote was above suspicion even
in the opinion of enemies.</p>
<p>3. Dost thou see the abundance of resource belonging to God? His wisdom, His extraordinary
power, His loving-kindness and care? Be not therefore dismayed or troubled
but continue to give thanks to God for all things, praising, and invoking Him; beseeching
and supplicating; even if countless tumults and troubles come upon thee, even if tempests
are stirred up before thy eyes let none of these things disturb thee. For our Master is not
baffled by the difficulty, even if all things are reduced to the extremity of ruin. For it is possible
for Him to raise those who have fallen, to convert those who are in error, to set straight
those who have been ensnared, to release those who have been laden with countless sins,
and make them righteous, to quicken those who are dead, to restore lustre to decayed things,
and freshness to those which have waxen old. For if He makes things which are not, come
into being, and bestows existence on things which are nowhere by any means manifest, how
much more will He rectify things which already exist. But you will say there are many who
perish, many who are caught by snares. Many such things have indeed often taken place,
yet afterwards have all received their appropriate correction, save some few who have remained
in an incurable condition, even after the change in their circumstances. Why are
you troubled and distracted because such a person is cast out and such another is put into
his place? Christ was crucified and the release of Barabbas the robber was demanded, and
the depraved populace clamoured for the preservation of the murderer rather than of the
Saviour and benefactor. How many think you then stumbled at these things? how many

<pb n="400"/>
were destroyed? But I must carry my argument yet further back. Did not He who was crucified
become immediately after his birth a wanderer and a fugitive? was He not from the
very cradle removed with the whole household into a strange land, taking that long journey
into a barbarous region? And this removal gave occasion to torrents of blood, and cruel
murder and slaughter, and all the children of tender age were cut to pieces just as if they
had been soldiers arrayed in battle, and infants torn from the breast were handed over to
death, and even when the milk was in their throats, the sword was driven through their
necks. What could be more distressing than this tragedy? And these things were done by
him who sought to destroy Jesus, yet the long-suffering God endured this tragical cruelty,
which caused so much bloodshed, and forbore to prevent it although He had the power,
displaying his long-suffering for some inscrutably wise purpose. And when Jesus had returned
from the foreign land and was grown up, war was rekindled against him on every side. First
of all the disciples of John were envious of Him and tried to slander Him, although John
himself behaved reverently to Him, and they said “He who was with thee beyond Jordan,
behold the same baptizeth and all men come to Him.”914 For these were the words of men
who were already irritated, and agitated by ill-will, and consumed by that passion. For the
same reason also one of the disciples who said these things disputed with a certain Jew and
raised a contentious argument about purifying, comparing one kind of baptism with another,
the baptism of John with that of the disciples of Christ. “For there arose” it is said, “a questioning
on the part of John’s disciples with a certain Jew about purifying.”915 And when He
began to work miracles how many calumniators He had! Some called Him a Samaritan and
demoniac saying “Thou art a Samaritan and hast a Devil”916 others “a deceiver,” saying
“This man is not of God but deceiveth the multitude”917 others “a sorcerer” saying “He
casteth out devils through Beelzebub the prince of the Devils”918 and they continually said
these things against Him and called Him an adversary of God, and a gluttonous, and greedy
man, and a drunkard, and a friend of the wicked and depraved. “For” He said, “the Son of
man came eating and drinking and they say behold a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber, a
friend of publicans and sinners.”919 And when he was conversing with the harlot they called
Him a false prophet; “For had He been a prophet,” one said, “He would have known who

this woman is which speaketh unto Him;”920 in fact every day they sharpened their teeth
against Him. And not only did the Jews thus oppose Him, but even those who were reputed
to be his brethren were not sincerely attached to Him, but even out of his own family opposition
was kindled against Him. See at least how they also themselves were perverted, from
the evangelist adding the remark “for neither did His brethren believe on Him.”921</p>
<p>4. But since you call to mind many who were offended and went astray, how many of
the disciples do you suppose were offended at the time of the crucifixion? One betrayed
Him, the others took to flight, one denied Him, and when all had abandoned Him He was
led away bound without companions. How many then think you who had lately seen Him
working His miracles, raising the dead, cleansing lepers, casting out devils, multiplying
loaves, and doing all other kinds of wonderful deeds, were offended at that season, when
they beheld Him led away and bound, surrounded by common soldiers, and followed by
Jewish priests making a tumult and uproar; alone in the midst hemmed in by all his enemies,
and the traitor standing by and exulting in his deed? And what was the effect think you
when He was being scourged? and probably a vast multitude was present. For it was an illustrious
festival which brought all together, and this drama of iniquity was enacted in the
capital city, and in the very middle of the day. How many think you who were present then
were offended when they saw Him bound, scourged, streaming with blood, examined before
the governor’s tribunal, and not one of His disciples standing by? What was the effect again
when He was subjected to those manifold kinds of mockery, successively repeated, when
they crowned Him with thorns, then arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, then put a reed in
His hand, then fell down and worshipped Him, setting in motion every species of ribaldry
and derision? How many think you were offended, how many bewildered, how many perplexed
when they smote Him on the cheek and said “prophesy unto us thou Christ who is
He that smote thee?”922 and when they led Him hither and thither, and spent the whole day
in scoffs and abuse, and ribaldry and derision in the midst of the Jewish assembly? and when
the servant of the High-Priest dealt Him a blow; and when the soldiers parted His garments
amongst them and when He was led up to the cross, having the marks of the scourge upon
His back, and was fastened to the wood, how many think you were offended? For not even
then were those savage beasts softened, but became more furious than before, and the tragedy
became more intense, and the ribaldry increased. For some said “Ah! thou that destroyest
the temple, and in three days buildest it up;”923 and some, “He saved others, Himself He
cannot save.”924</p>

<p>And others said “If thou art the Son of God come down from the cross and we will believe
thee.”925</p>
<p>Again when they insulted Him by offering Him gall and vinegar on the sponge how
many think you were offended? or when the robbers reviled Him? or when as I have already
said, they made that dreadful and monstrous assertion that the robber and housebreaker,
the man laden with the crime of murder deserved to be released rather than Jesus, and
having received permission from the judge to make their choice preferred Barabbas, desiring
not only to crucify Christ, but also to involve Him in infamy? For they thought that by these
means they should be able to manufacture the belief that He was worse than the robber,
and such a great transgressor that neither on the plea of mercy, nor of the privilege of the
Festival was it possible to save Him. For they did everything with a view to slander His fame;
which also was the reason why they crucified the two robbers with Him. Nevertheless the
truth was not obscured, but shone forth all the more clearly. And they accused Him of
usurping kingly power saying “Every one who maketh himself a king is not a friend of
Cæsar”926 bringing this charge of usurpation against one who had not where to lay his head.
Moreover they brought a calumnious accusation of blasphemy against Him. For the High
Priest rent his clothes saying “He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of
witnesses?”927 And what was the nature of his death? was it not a violent one? was it not
the death of capital offenders? of execrable criminals? was it not of the vilest kind? was it
not the death of those who have perpetrated the worst offences, and are not worthy to draw
even their last breath upon the earth? And then as to the manner of his burial, was it not
accomplished as a matter of favour? For a certain one came and begged for his body. Thus
not even he who buried Him belonged to his own friends, to those whom He had benefited,
to his disciples, to those who had enjoyed such free and salutary intercourse with Him, for
all had taken to flight, all had hurried away from Him. And that base suspicion which his
enemies contrived in consequence of the resurrection when they said “His disciples came
and stole Him”928 how many think you were offended, how many for a time upset by that?
For the story prevailed at that time, although it was a fabrication, and was bought for money;
nevertheless it held its ground amongst some people, after the seals (of the sepulchre were
broken)929 after the manifest appearance of the truth. For the multitude did not know the
prediction of the resurrection (and no wonder), inasmuch as even his disciples did not un-

derstand it; for we read “they did not know that He must rise again from the dead.”930 How
many therefore think you were offended in those days? And yet the long-suffering God patiently
endured, ordering all things according to His own inscrutable wisdom.</p>
<p>5. Then again after those days the disciples continued to live in hiding and secrecy, being
fugitives full of fear and trembling, continually shifting from place to place, and even when
they began to appear after fifty days, and to work miracles, they did not enjoy perfect security;
but even after those events there were innumerable stumbling-blocks to offend the weaker
brethren, when they were scourged, when the Church was distressed, when they themselves
were driven away, and their enemies had the upper hand in many places, and raised tumults.
For when they had acquired much confidence by means of the miracles which they wrought,
then the death of Stephen again caused a severe persecution, and dispersed them all, and
involved the Church in confusion; and the disciples were again alarmed, fugitive, and distressed.
And yet the Church continually grew, when it flourished by means of the signs
which were wrought and became illustrious from the manner of its introduction. One disciple
for example was let down through a window, and so escaped the hands of the ruler; others
were brought out of prison by an angel and so released from their fetters; others were received
into the houses of common people and artisans when they were driven out by those in authority;
they were courteously treated in every way, by female sellers of purple, by tentmakers,
and tanners dwelling in the outskirts of the cities, and by the sea shore. Frequently moreover
they did not dare to appear in the middle of the towns; and if they did venture there themselves
their entertainers did not. And thus amidst alternate trials, and respites from trial,
the fabric of the Church was wrought, and they who once stumbled were afterwards set
upright, and they who wandered away were brought back, and the ruined places were built
up more firmly than before. For this cause when Paul prayed that the preaching of the word
might proceed by a smooth course only, God rich in wisdom and resource did not yield to
His disciple; nay even when many times invoked he would not consent but said “my grace
is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness.”931 If then even now you
will reckon up the good things with the painful, you will see that many events have occurred
which if not positive signs and wonders do yet resemble signs, and are unspeakable proofs
of the great providence and succour of God. But that you may not hear everything from me
without any trouble, I leave this as thy task, that you may reckon up everything accurately
and compare them with the misfortunes, and by occupying yourself with this good employment
may divert your mind from despondency; for you will derive much consolation from
this work.</p>

<p>Do not be anxious on my behalf, nor rack yourself with solicitude, on account of the
severity of the winter, and the weakness of my digestion, and the incursions of the Isaurians.
For the winter is only what it is wont to be in Armenia; nothing more need be said about
it; and it does not very seriously injure me. For in anticipation of these things I have devised
many plans for averting the mischief which might arise from them; keeping up a constant
fire, setting screens about the chamber in which I live, using a large number of rugs, and
staying always indoors. This indeed is irksome to me, if it were not for the benefit to be derived;
for as long as I remain indoors I am not severely distressed by the cold; but if I am
compelled to go out a little, and come in contact with the outer air, I suffer no small damage.
Wherefore I beseech thee dear lady, and entreat thee as a very great favour to pay great attention
to the restoration of thy bodily health. For dejection causes sickness; and when the
body is exhausted and enfeebled, and remains in a neglected condition, deprived of the assistance
of physicians, and of a wholesome climate, and an abundant supply of the necessaries
of life, consider how great an aggravation of distress is occasioned thereby. Wherefore I
beseech you, dear lady, to employ various and skilled physicians, and to take medicines
which avail to correct these conditions. For a few days ago when I suffered from a tendency
to vomiting, owing to the state of the atmosphere, I had recourse amongst other remedies
to the drug which was sent me by my most discreet mistress Syncletion, and I found that
no more than three days’ application of it cured my infirmity. I beseech you therefore to
make use of this remedy also yourself and to arrange that some more of it may be sent to
me. For having again felt somewhat upset, I again had recourse to it, and completely cured
my disorder; for it allays the deep internal inflammation, draws out moisture on the skin,
causes a moderate degree of warmth, infuses no little vigor, and excites an appetite for food;
and all these effects I experienced in the course of a few days. Let then my most honoured
lord the Count Theophilus be exhorted to take means to send some of this to me again. And
do not be distressed at my wintering here, for I am in a much more comfortable and sounder
state of health than I was last year; so that if you also would take the requisite care of yourself,
you would be in a far more satisfactory condition. Now if you say that your ailments have
been produced by despondency how is it that you again ask for letters from me, seeing that
you have not derived any benefit from them in the direction of cheerfulness, but have sunk
so deeply under the tyranny of despondency as even to desire to depart out of this world.
Are you ignorant how great a reward even of sickness awaits one who has a thankful spirit?
Have I not often, both in person, and through letters, discoursed to you concerning this
theme? But since the pressure of business perhaps, or the peculiar nature of your sickness,
and the quick succession of changes in your condition do not permit you to retain what I
have said constantly and clearly in your mind, listen once more whilst I try to heal the

<pb n="406"/>
wounds of thy despondency by repeating the same incantations: “for to write the same
things,” it is said, “to me indeed is not grievous, and for you it is safe.”932</p>
<p>2. What is it then which I say and write? Nothing, Olympias, redounds so much to the
credit of any one as patient endurance in suffering. For this is indeed the queen of virtues,
and the perfection of crowns; and as it excels all other forms of righteousness, so this particular
species of it is more glorious than the rest. Perhaps what I have said seems obscure; I
will therefore try to make it clearer. What then is it that I affirm? Not the spoliation of goods,
even if one were to be stripped bare of all one’s possessions, not the loss of honours, nor
expulsion from one’s country, and transportation to a distant land, nor the strain of labour
and toil, nor imprisonment, and bondage, nor reproaches, and abuse, and scoffings (not
indeed that you are to think the courageous endurance of such things a slight kind of fortitude,
as Jeremiah that great and eminent prophet proves who was not a little distressed by
this kind of trial);933 yet not even this, nor the loss of children, even should they be torn
from us in one fell swoop, nor the perpetual assaults of enemies, nor anything else of that
nature, no, nor even the head and crown of things accounted painful, namely death, terrible
and loathsome though it be, is so oppressive as infirmity of body. And this is proved by the
greatest hero of endurance,934 who, when he was encompassed by bodily sickness, thought
death would be a release from the calamities which were depressing him; and when he underwent
all the other sufferings, was not sensible of them, although he received blow after
blow, and at last a deadly one. For it was no slight matter, but rather an evidence of the most
malignant cruelty on the part of his enemy in dealing with one who was no novice in suffering,
nor entering the lists for the first time, but already exhausted with the frequent repetition
of assaults, to inflict upon him that deadly blow, the destruction of his children, so cruelly
inflicted moreover that all of either sex were destroyed at the same moment in early youth
and by a violent end, and so instantaneous was their death that it involved their burial also.
For their father neither saw them laid upon abed, nor kissed their hands, nor heard their
last words, nor touched their hands and knees, nor did he shut their mouths, or close their
eyes when they were about to die, acts which tend not a little to console parents who are
being parted from their children; neither did he follow some of them to burial, and find
others on his return home to console him for those who had departed; but he heard that as
they were reclining on their couches at a banquet, a banquet full of love, not of excess, a
table of brotherly kindness, they were all overwhelmed; and blood, and wine, the cups and
the ceiling, the table, and the dust, and the limbs of his children, were all mingled together.
Nevertheless when he heard these things, and others before these which were also distressing;
<note type="footnote">932 Phil. iii. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">933 Jer. xv.</note>
<note type="footnote">934 Sc. Job.</note>

<pb n="407"/>
for they too had perished in a distressing way; flocks and whole herds had been destroyed,
the latter having been consumed by fire sent down from heaven, (so said the evil messenger
of this tragedy,) and the former having been all seized together by various enemies, and cut
to pieces as well as the shepherds themselves; nevertheless I say when he saw this great storm
stirred up in a brief moment of time affecting his lands, his house, his cattle, and his children,
when he saw billow following billow, and long lines of rocks, and the darkness was profound,
and the surging waves unbearable, even then he was not tortured by despondency, and
scarcely seemed to feel the things which had happened, save so far as he was a man and a
father. But when he was delivered over to sickness and sores, then did he also long for death,
then did he also bewail himself and lament, so that you may understand how this kind of
suffering is more severe than all others, and this form of patience the highest of all. Nor is
the Devil himself unaware of this fact; for when after having set in motion all these trials he
perceived that the hero remained untroubled and undismayed he rushed to this as the
greatest contest of all, saying that all the other calamities were bearable, as loss of child, or
property, or anything else (for this is what is meant by the expression “skin for skin”935)
but the deadly blow was when pain was inflicted on a man’s body. And therefore when he
had been worsted after this contest, he had no longer a word to utter, although on former
occasions he had made the most strenuous and shameless resistance. In this instance however
he found that he could not invent any further shameless device, but hid his face and retreated.</p>
<p>3. Think not however that it is an excuse to justify you in desiring death, that Job desired
it, not being able to bear his sufferings. For consider the time when he desired it, and the
disposition of his circumstances—the law was not given, the prophets had not appeared,
grace had not been shed forth as it was afterwards, nor had he the advantage of any other
kind of philosophy. For as a proof that more is demanded from us than from those who
lived then, and that harder tasks are assigned to us, listen to Christ, when He says “Except
your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees ye shall in no case
enter into the kingdom of Heaven.”936 Do not think therefore that to pray for death now
is exempt from blame, but hearken to the voice of St. Paul when he says “To depart and to
be with Christ is far better, but to abide in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.”937 For
in proportion as the strain of the affliction is increased are the garlands of victory multiplied;
in proportion as the gold is heated does it become purified, the longer the merchant makes
his voyage on the sea, the larger is the freight which he collects. Do not then think that the
labour now allotted to you is a slight one, but rather that it is higher than all which you have
undergone, I mean that which consists in infirmity of body. For in the case of Lazarus938
<note type="footnote">935 Job ii. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">936 Matt. v. 20.</note>
<note type="footnote">937 Phil. i. 23, 24.</note>
<note type="footnote">938 Luke xvi.</note>

<pb n="408"/>
(and although I may have often said this to you, it nowise hinders me from saying it now)
this bodily infirmity availed for his salvation; and he departed to the bosom of the man who
possessed a dwelling which he shared with all who passed by,939 and was continually shifting
his home on account of God’s command, and sacrificed his own son, his only begotten, who
had been given him in extreme old age; although Lazarus had done none of these things yet
he obtained this blessing inasmuch as he cheerfully endured poverty, and infirmity, and
friendlessness. For this is so great a good to those who bear anything bravely that it releases
any one who may have committed the greatest sins from the heaviest burden of them; or if
any one is an upright and just man it becomes an additional ground of the greatest confidence.
For it is a bright wreath of victory for the just, shining far above the brightness of the
sun, and it is the greatest means of purification for those who have sinned. On this account
Paul delivers the man who had made the incestuous marriage to “destruction of the flesh,”
purifying him by this means. For as a proof that what was done did purify even from so
great a stain hear his words “that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.”940 And
when he was accusing others of another very awful sin, that of partaking unworthily of the
holy table and those secret mysteries, and had said that such a person will be “guilty of the
body and blood of the Lord,”941 observe how he says that they also are purified from that
grievous stain—“therefore are many weak and sickly among you.”942 And then by way of
proving that they will not be confined to this condition of punishment, but that some profit
will be derived from it, namely release from the penalties to which the sin is liable, he added:
“for if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But now when we are judged,
we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.”943 Moreover
that they who have lived very righteously derive much benefit from such chastisement is
plain from the case of Job, who was more illustrious after it than before, and from the case
of Timothy, who although he was such a good man, and entrusted with such an important
ministry, and made the circuit of the world with Paul passed not two or three days, nor ten
or twenty, or a hundred, but many in succession in ill health, his body being very seriously
enfeebled. Paul shows this where he said “Use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake, and thine
often infirmities.”944 And he who raised the dead did not cure this man’s infirmity, but left
him in the furnace of his sickness so that he might therefrom contract a very great abundance
of confidence. For the lessons which Paul himself had enjoyed from his Master, and the

<pb n="409"/>
training which he had received from Him, he imparted to his disciple. For although he was
not subjected to bodily infirmity, yet he was buffeted by trials not less severe, which inflicted
much physical pain. “For there was given unto me” he says “a thorn in the flesh, a messenger
of Satan to buffet me”945 meaning by this the blows, the bonds, the chains, the imprisonments,
the being dragged about, and maltreated, and tortured by the scourges of public executioners.
Wherefore also being unable to bear the pain occasioned to the body by these
things “for this I besought the Lord thrice (thrice here meaning many times) that I might
be delivered from this thorn.” And then when he did not obtain his petition, having learned
the benefit of the trial, he held his peace, and rejoiced at the things which happened unto
him.</p>
<p>Therefore even if you remain at home, and are set fast in bed, do not consider your life
an idle one; for you undergo more severe pains than those who are dragged, and maltreated,
and tortured by executioners, inasmuch as in this excessive infirmity of yours you have a
perpetual executioner residing with you.</p>
<p>4. Do not then now desire death, nor neglect the means of cure; for indeed this would
not be safe. On this account Paul also exhorts Timothy to take the greatest care of himself.
As regards infirmity then enough has now been said. But if it is separation from me which
causes your despondency expect release from this. And I have not said this now merely to
encourage you, but I am sure that it really will be the case. For if it were not destined to
happen, I should long ago, so at least I think, have departed from this world, considering
the trials which have been inflicted on me. For to pass over all that occurred in Constantinople,
after my departure thence, you may understand what sufferings I endured on
that long and cruel journey, most of which were sufficient to produce death; what I endured
after my arrival here, after my removal from Cucusus, and after my sojourn in Arabissus.
Yet I have survived all these things, and now I am in sound health, and great security, so
that all Armenians are astonished that with such a feeble and flimsy frame as mine I can
support such an intolerable amount of cold, or that I can breathe at all, when those who are
habituated to the winter are suffering from it in no common degree. Nevertheless I have
remained uninjured up to the present day, having escaped the hands of robbers who have
repeatedly attacked us, and yet in daily want of the necessaries of life, and deprived of the
use of a bath; and although since my sojourn here I have been constantly without this luxury
I am now so established in the habit that I do not even long for the comfort to be derived
from it, but am in sounder health than before. And neither the inclemency of the climate,
nor the desolation of the region, nor the scarcity of provisions, nor the lack of attendants,
<note type="footnote">945 2 Cor. xii. 7. The word rendered “thorn” more properly signifies a “stake;” and the expression, especially
when compared with Gal. iv. 14, would rather seem to indicate some painful bodily infirmity, perhaps weakness
of eyesight (see Gal. iv. 19) than the indignities to which he was subjected.</note>

<pb n="410"/>
nor the unskillfulness of physicians, nor the deprivation of the bath, nor perpetual confinement
in one chamber as in a prison, and the impossibility of moving about which I always
used continually to need, nor perpetual contact with fire and smoke, nor fear of robbers,
nor a constant state of siege, nor anything else of this kind has got the better of me; on the
contrary I am in a sounder condition of health than I was elsewhere, although I then received
great care and attention. Taking all these things then into consideration pray shake off the
despondency which now oppresses you, and do not exact inordinate and cruel penances
from yourself. I sent you the treatise which I have lately written, that “no one can harm the
man who does not injure himself,”946 and the letter which I now send your honour contends
for the same position. I beg you therefore to go over it constantly, and if your health permits
you, recite it aloud. For if you will, it may prove an effectual remedy for you. But if you are
contentious with me, and do not try to cure yourself, and will not rouse yourself from these
dismal swamps of despondency in spite of the unlimited amount of advice and exhortation
which you enjoy I shall not on my part readily consent to send you frequent and long letters,
if you are not to derive any benefit in the way of cheerfulness from them. How then shall I
know this? not by your merely saying so, but by a practical proof, inasmuch as you lately
affirmed that it was nothing but despondency which caused this sickness of yours. Since
then you have yourself made this confession I shall not believe that you have got rid of your
despondency unless you have got rid of your bodily infirmity. For if it is the former which
causes your disorder, as you say in your letter, it is obvious that when that has been dispersed
the other will be removed at the same time, and when the root has been plucked up, the
branches perish with it;—and if the branches continue flowering and flourishing, and producing
an unnatural amount of fruit I cannot believe that you have been set free from the
root of your distress. Therefore do not show me words but facts, and, if you get well, you
will see letters sent to you again exceeding the limits of former communications. Deem it
then no small consolation that I am alive, and in good health, and that in the midst of such
circumstances I have been set free from sickness and infirmity, which, as I know, is a great
annoyance and vexation to my enemies. It follows therefore that you should deem this the
greatest encouragement, and the crown of your consolation. Do not call your household
desolate, which has now a higher place assigned to it in Heaven by reason of the sufferings
which it endures. I was grievously distressed on account of Pelagius the monk.947 Consider
therefore what great rewards they deserve who bravely hold their ground, when men who

<p>Having risen from the very gates of death I address this letter to the discreet lady; and
I am very glad that thy servants have met me just as I am anchoring at last in harbour. For
had they met me when I was still tossing on the open sea, and experiencing the cruel waves
of bodily sickness, it would not have been easy for me to deceive your cautious spirit, by
sending good tidings instead of sorrowful. For the winter, which has become more than
commonly severe, brought on a storm of internal disorder even more distressing, and during
the last two months I have been no better than one dead, nay worse. For I had just enough
life to be sensible of the horrors which encircled me, and day and dawn and noon were all
one night to me as I spent all my time closely confined to my bed, and in spite of endless
contrivances I could not shake off the pernicious effects of the cold; but although I kept a
fire burning, and endured a most unpleasant amount of smoke, and remained cooped up
in one chamber, covered with any quantity of wraps, and not daring to set a foot outside
the threshold I underwent extreme sufferings, perpetual vomiting supervening on headache,
loss of appetite, and constant sleeplessness. Thus restlessly did I pass through my long dark
sea of troubles. But not to distress thy mind by dwelling upon my miseries, from all of them
I am now relieved. For as soon as spring approached, and a little change in the temperature
took place, all my troubles spontaneously vanished. Nevertheless I still require great care
as regards diet; therefore I put only a light load on my stomach, so that it may be able to
digest it easily. But it has occasioned me no little concern to learn that my discreet mistress
was brought to the verge of death. Nevertheless in consideration of my great affection, and
anxiety, and solicitude for your welfare I was relieved from this care, even before the arrival
of your letters, many persons having come from thence who brought me tidings of your
restoration to health.</p>
<p>And now I am exceedingly glad and delighted to hear, not only that you have been released
from your infirmity, but above all that you bear the things which befall you so bravely,
calling them all but an idle tale; and, which is indeed a greater matter, that you have applied
this name even to your bodily infirmity, which is an evidence of a robust spirit, rich in the
fruit of courage. For not only to bear misfortunes bravely but to be actually insensible to
them, to overlook them, and with such little exertion to wreathe your brows with the garland
prize of patience, neither labouring, nor toiling, neither feeling distress nor causing it to
others, but as it were leaping and dancing for joy all the while, this is indeed a proof of the
most finished philosophy.948 Therefore I rejoice, and leap for joy; I am in a flutter of delight,
I am insensible to my present loneliness, and the other troubles which surround me, being
cheered, and brightened, and not a little proud on account of your greatness of soul, and

the repeated victories which you have won, and this, not only for your own sake, but also
for the sake of that large and populous city,949 where you are like a tower, a haven, and a
wall of defence, speaking in the eloquent voice of example, and through your sufferings instructing
either sex to strip readily for these contests, and descend into the lists with all
courage, and cheerfully bear the toils which such contests involve. And the wonder is that
without thrusting yourself into the forum, or occupying the public centres of the city, but
sitting all the while in a small house and confined chamber you serve and anoint the combatants
for the contest, and whilst the sea is thus raging round you, and the billows are rising
to a crest, and crags and reefs, and rocky ledges and fierce monsters appear on every side,
and everything is shrouded in the most profound darkness you, setting the sails of patience,
float on with great serenity, as if it was noonday, and calm weather, and a favourable breeze
wafting you on, and so far from being overwhelmed by this grievous tempest are not even
sprinkled by the spray; and very naturally so; such is the force of virtue as a rudder. Now
merchants and pilots, and sailors and voyagers when they see clouds gathering up, or fierce
winds rushing down upon them, or the breakers seething with an abundance of foam keep
their vessels moored inside harbour; and if they chance to be tempest-tossed in the open
sea they do their best, and devise every means to bring their ship to some anchorage, or island
or shore. But you, although such innumerable winds, and fierce waves burst upon you together,
and the sea is heaved up from its very depths owing to the severity of the storm, and
some are submerged, others floating dead upon the water, others drifting naked upon planks,
you plunging into the mid ocean of calamities call all these things an idle tale, sailing on
with a favourable breeze in the midst of the tempest; and naturally so; for pilots, even if they
are infinitely wise in that science, nevertheless have not skill sufficient to withstand every
kind of storm; consequently they often shrink from doing battle with the waves. But the
science which you have is superior to every kind of storm—the power of a philosophic
soul—which is stronger than ten thousand armies, more powerful than arms, and more secure
than towers and bulwarks. For the arms, and bulwarks, and towers which soldiers have, are
serviceable for the security of the body only, and this not always, nor in every way; but there
are times when all these resources are baffled, and leave those who fly to them for refuge
destitute of protection. But thy powers do not repel the weapons of barbarians, nor the
devices of hostile men, nor any assaults and stratagems of that kind, but they have trampled
under foot the constraining forces of nature, put down their tyranny and levelled their citadel.
And whilst ceaselessly contending with demons, you have won countless victories, yet have
not received a single blow, but stand unwounded in the midst of a storm of darts and turn
the spears which are hurled at you back upon those who discharge them. Such is the wisdom
of your art; by the sufferings which you undergo you take vengeance on those who inflict

them; by the plots of which you are the subject you put your enemies to pain, possessing in
their malice the best foundation for the materials of fame. And you, knowing these things
well yourself, and having gained perception by experience, naturally call them all an idle
tale. For how, pray, should you not call them by that name, possessing as you do a mortal
body, and yet despising death as if you were hastening to quit a foreign country, and return
to your own land; a chronic sufferer from the most severe infirmity, and yet more cheerfully
disposed than the thriving and robust, not depressed by insults, nor elated by honours and
glory, the latter being a cause of infinite mischief to many who after an illustrious career in
the priesthood, and after reaching extreme old age, and the most venerable hoar hairs, have
fallen into disgrace on this account, and become a common spectacle of derision for those
who wish to make merry. But you on the contrary, woman as you are, clothed with a fragile
body, and subject to these severe attacks, have not only avoided falling into such a condition
yourself, but have prevented many others from so doing. They indeed before they had advanced
far in the contest, even at the very outset and starting point, have been overthrown;
whereas you, after having gone countless times round the farther turning post, have won a
prize in every course, after playing your part in manifold kinds of wrestling and combats.
And very naturally so; for the wrestlings of virtue do not depend upon age, or bodily strength,
but only on the spirit and the disposition. Thus women have been crowned victors, while
men have been upset; so also boys have been proclaimed conquerors, while aged men have
been put to shame. It is indeed always fitting to admire those who pursue virtue, but especially
when some are found to cling to it at a time when many are deserting it. Therefore, my sweet
lady, you deserve superlative admiration, inasmuch as after so many men, women, and aged
persons who seemed to enjoy the greatest reputation have been turned to flight, all lying
prostrate before the eyes of the world, and this not after a severe onslaught, nor any alarming
muster of the enemy’s force, but overthrown before the encounter and worsted before the
struggle, you on the contrary after so many battles and such large muster of the enemy are
so far from being unstrung, or dismayed by the number of your adversities, that you are all
the more vigorous, and the increase of the contest gives you an increase of strength. For the
recollection of what has been already achieved becomes the ground of cheerfulness, and
joy, and greater zeal. Therefore I rejoice, and leap for joy; for I will not cease repeating this,
and taking about with me everywhere the material of my joy; so that although my separation
from you distresses you, yet you have this very great consolation arising from your successful
exploits; for I also who am banished to so great a distance gain no small cheerfulness from
this cause,—I mean your courage.</p>

<p>Why do you lament? why do you belabour yourself, and demand of yourself a punishment
which your enemies were not able to demand from you, having thus abandoned your
soul to the tyranny of dejection? For the letters which you sent to me by the hands of Patricius
have discovered to me the wounds which have been inflicted on your mind. Wherefore also
I am very sorrowful and much distressed that when you ought to be using every exertion
and making it your business to expel dejection from your soul, you go about collecting distressing
thoughts, even inventing things (so you say) which do not exist, and tearing yourself
to pieces for no purpose, and to your very great injury. For why are you grieved because
you could not remove me from Cucusus? Yet indeed, as far as you were concerned, you did
remove me, having made every exertion and endeavour for this purpose. And even if it has
not been actually accomplished you ought not to be vexed on that account. For perhaps it
seemed good to God that I should be set to run the longer double course,950 in order that
the garland of victory might be rendered more glorious. Why then are you vexed on account
of these things, in consequence of which my fame is spread abroad, when you ought to leap
and dance for joy and bind wreaths upon your brow, because I have been deemed worthy
of so great an honour which far exceeds my merits? Is it the desolation of this place which
grieves you? Yet what can be pleasanter than my sojourn here? I have quietness, and tranquillity,
plenty of leisure and good bodily health. For although the town has neither marketplace
nor market that is nothing to me. For all things are poured abundantly upon me as
out of a flowing spring. I find my lord the Bishop here and my lord Dioscorus are constantly
employed in providing for my refreshment. And the good Patricius will tell you that as far
as my sojourn here is concerned I pass my time cheerfully and gladly, surrounded by attention.
But if you lament the events which occurred in Cæsarea, here again your conduct is
unworthy of yourself. For there also bright garlands of victory were woven for me, inasmuch
as all were proclaiming and publishing my praises, and expressing wonder and astonishment
at the ill-treatment to which I had been subjected followed by expulsion. Meanwhile however
do not let any one know these things, although they are the theme of much gossip. For my
lord Poeanius has disclosed to me that the presbyters of Pharetrius himself951 have arrived
on the spot, who declare that they were in communion with me and had no communication
or intercourse or partnership with my adversaries. Therefore to avoid upsetting them do
not let any one know these things. For certainly the things which befell me were very
grievous: and if I had not suffered any other distress the events which happened there would
have sufficed to procure innumerable rewards for me: so extreme was the danger which I

<note type="footnote">951 Pharetrius was Bishop of Cæsarea, and, as the sequel shows, a malicious enemy of Chrysostom.</note>

<pb n="416"/>
encountered. Now I beseech you to keep these matters secret, and so I will give you a short
account of them, not in order to grieve you but rather to make you glad. For herein consists
the material of my gain, herein consists my wealth, herein the means of getting rid of my
sins—that my journey is continually encompassed by trials of this kind, and that they are
inflicted upon me by persons from whom they were quite unexpected. For when I was about
to enter the region of Cappadocia, having escaped from that man of Galatia, who nearly
threatened me with death,952 many persons met me on the way saying “the lord Pharetrius
is awaiting you, and going about in all directions for fear of missing the pleasure of meeting
you, and making every possible endeavour to see you, and embrace you, and show you all
manner of affectionate regard; and he has set the monasteries of men and women in motion
for this purpose.” Now when I heard these things I did not expect that any of them would
really take place, but formed an impression in my own mind precisely the reverse: but of
this I said nothing to any of those who brought me this message.</p>
<p>2. Now when I arrived late one evening at Cæsarea, in an exhausted and worn-out
condition, being in the very height of a burning fever, faint and suffering to the last degree,
I lighted upon an inn situated just at the outskirts of the city, and took great pains to find
some physicians and allay this fiery fever; for it was now the height of my tertian malady.
And in addition to this there was the fatigue of the journey, the toil, the strain, the total absence
of attendants, the difficulty of getting supplies, the want of a physician, the wasting
effects of toil, and heat and sleeplessness; thus I was well nigh a dead man when I entered
the city. Then indeed I was visited by the whole body of the clergy, and the people, monks,
nuns, physicians, and I had the benefit of great attention, as all paid me every kind of ministration
and assistance. Yet even thus, being oppressed by the lethargy arising from the feverish
heat I was in an extremely distressed condition. At length by degrees the malady was
coming to an end and abating. Pharetrius however nowhere appeared; but waited for my
departure, I know not with what purpose in view. When then I saw that my disorder had
slightly abated I began to form plans for my journey so as to reach Cucusus, and enjoy a
little repose after the calamities of the way. And whilst I was thus situated it was suddenly
announced that the Isaurians953 in countless multitudes were overrunning the district of
Cæsarea, and had burnt a large village, and were most violently disposed. The tribune,
having heard this, took the soldiers which he had and went out. For they were afraid lest
the enemy should make an assault also upon the city, and all were in terror, and in an agony
of alarm the very soil of their country being in jeopardy, so that even the old men undertook
the defence of the walls. While affairs were in this condition suddenly towards dawn a

<pb n="417"/>
rabble954 of monks (for so I must call them, indicating their frenzy by the expression) rushed
up to the house where we were, threatening to set fire to it, and to treat us with the utmost
violence unless we turned out of it. And neither the fear of the Isaurians, nor my own infirmity
which was so grievously afflicting me, nor anything else made them more reasonable,
but they pressed on, animated by such fierce rage that even the proconsular soldiers were
terrified. For they kept threatening them with blows and boasted that they had shamefully
beaten many of the proconsular soldiers. The soldiers having heard these things, sought
refuge with me, and entreated and beseeched me, saying “even if we are to fall into the hands
of the Isaurians deliver us from these wild beasts.” When the governor heard this he hastened
down to the house intending to succour me. But the monks would not pay any heed to his
exhortations, and in fact he was powerless. Perceiving the great strait in which affairs were
placed and not daring to advise me either to go out to certain death, or on the other hand
to stay indoors, owing to the excessive fury of these men, he sent to Pharetrius beseeching
him to grant a few days respite on account of my infirmity and the impending danger. But
even then nothing was effected, and on the morrow the monks arrived even fiercer than
before, and none of the presbyters dared to stand by me and help me, but covered with
shame and blushes (for they said that these things were done by the instructions of Pharetrius)
they concealed themselves and lay hid, not responding even when I called them. What
need to make a long story? Although such great terrors were imminent, and death well nigh
a certainty, and the fever was oppressing me (for I had not yet got relief from the troubles
arising from that cause) I flung myself at high noon into the litter, and was carried out
thence, all the people shrieking and howling, and imprecating curses on the perpetrator of
these deeds, whilst every one wailed and lamented. But when I got outside the city, some of
the clergy also gradually came out and escorted me, mourning as they went. And having
heard some persons say “Where are you leading him away to manifest death?” one of those
who was warmly attached to me said to me “Depart I entreat you; fall into the hands of the
Isaurians, provided you get clear away from us. For wherever you may fall, you will fall into
a place of security, if only you escape our hands.” Having heard and seen these things the
good Seleucia, the generous wife of my lord Ruffinus (a most attentive friend she was to
me), exhorted and entreated me to lodge at her suburban house which was about five miles
from the city and she sent some men to escort me, and so I departed thither.</p>
<p>3. But not even there was this plot against me to come to an end. For as soon as Pharetrius
knew what she had done, he published, as she said, many threats against her. But when
she received me into her suburban villa I knew nothing of these things; for when she came
out to meet me she concealed these things from me, but disclosed them to her steward who
<note type="footnote">954 There are many instances in the early history of the Eastern Church of similar fanatical fury on the part
of monks.</note>

<pb n="418"/>
was there, and ordered him to afford me every possible means of repose, and if any of the
monks should make an assault, wishing to insult or maltreat me, he was to collect the labourers
from her other farms, and thus marshal a force against them. Moreover she besought
me to take refuge in her house, which had a fortress and was impregnable, that I might escape
the hands of the bishop and monks. This however I could not be induced to do, but remained
in the villa, knowing nothing of the plans which were devised after these things. For even
then they were not content to desist from their fury against me but Pharetrius beset the lady
as she says, straitly threatening her, constraining and forcing her to expel me even from the
suburbs, so that at midnight, I knowing nothing of these things, the lady being unable to
endure his annoyance, announced, without my knowledge, that the barbarians were at hand,
for she was ashamed to mention the compulsion which she had undergone. So in the middle
of the night Evethius the presbyter came to me, and having roused me from sleep, exclaimed
with a loud voice “Get up, I pray you, the barbarians are upon us, they are close at hand.”
Imagine my condition on hearing this! Then, when I said to him what must we do? we
cannot take refuge in the city lest we suffer worse things than what the Isaurians are going
to do to us, he compelled me to go out. It was midnight, a dark, murky night without a
moon—a circumstance which filled up the measure of our perplexity—we had no companion,
no assistant, for all had deserted us. Nevertheless under the pressure of fear and in the ex-
pectation of immediate death, I got up, suffering as I was, having ordered torches to be lit.
These however the presbyter ordered to be put out, for fear as he said lest the barbarians
should be attracted by the light and attack us; so the torches were extinguished. Then the
mule which carried my litter fell on its knees, the road being rugged, and steep and stony,
and I who was inside was thrown down and narrowly escaped destruction, after which I
dismounted, and was dragged along on foot, being held fast by Evethius the presbyter (for
he also had alighted from his mule), and so I plodded on, led, or rather hauled by the hand,
for to walk was impossible through such a difficult country, and amongst steep mountains
in the middle of the night. Imagine what my sufferings must have been, encompassed as I
was by such calamities, and oppressed by the fever, ignorant of the plans which had been
made, but in terror of the barbarians and trembling. with the expectation of falling into their
hands. Do you not think that these sufferings alone, even if nothing else besides had befallen
me, would avail to blot out many of my sins, and afford ample material for obtaining praise
with God? Now the reason of all this, at least as I suppose, was, that as soon as I arrived in
Cæsarea, those who were in official positions, the learned men who were ex-vicars, and exgovernors,
the ex-tribunes and indeed the whole people visited me every day, paid me great
attention, and treated me as the apple of their eye; I suppose these things irritated Pharetrius
and that the envy which drove me from Constantinople did not refrain from pursuing me
even here. This at least is what I suppose, for I do not positively declare it but only suspect
it to be the fact.</p>

<pb n="419"/>
<p>And what is one to say about the other events which happened on the way, the fears
and the perils? as I recall them day by day, and continually bear them in mind, I am elated
with pleasure, I leap for joy as one who has a great treasure laid up in store for him; for such
is my position and feeling about them. Wherefore also I beseech your Honour to rejoice at
these things, to be glad, and leap for joy, and to glorify God who has counted me worthy to
suffer such things. And I beseech you to keep these matters to yourself, and not to divulge
them to any one, although for the most part the proconsular soldiers can fill all the city (with
the story) as they themselves have undergone extreme danger.</p>
<p>4. Nevertheless do not let any one know this from your prudence, but rather put down
those who talk about it. But if you are distressed lest the consequences of my ill-treatment
should remain, know for certain that I have shaken myself entirely free from them, and that
I am in better bodily health than when I was sojourning in Cæsarea. And why do you dread
the cold? for a suitable dwelling has been prepared for me, and my lord Dioscorus does and
arranges everything so as to prevent my having the least sensation of cold. And if I may
form a conjecture from the outset of my experience, the climate now seems to me oriental
in character, no less than that of Antioch. So great is the warmth, so pleasant is the temperature.
But you have grieved me much by saying, “perhaps you are annoyed with me as
having neglected you,” yet I despatched a letter many days ago to your honour begging you
not to move me from this place. Now I have had occasion to consider that you need a strong
defence and much toil and labour to be able to make a satisfactory apology for this expression.
But perhaps you have made a partial apology, by saying “I am generally occupied in thinking
how to increase my affliction.” But I in my turn reckon it as the greatest accusation that you
should say “I take a pride in increasing my sorrow by thinking over it:” for when you ought
to make every possible effort to dispel your affliction you do the devil’s will, by increasing
your despondency and sorrow. Are you not aware how great an evil despondency is?</p>
<p>As to the Isaurians, dismiss your fears in future concerning them: for they have returned
into their own country: and the governor has done everything necessary in this respect; and
I am in far greater security here than when I was in Cæsarea. For in future I have no one to
fear so much as the bishops, with a few exceptions. On account of the Isaurians then fear
nothing: for they have retreated, and when winter has set in they are confined to their own
homes, although they may possibly come out after Whitsuntide. And what do you mean by
saying that you have not the benefit of letters from me? I have already sent you three long
letters, one by the proconsular soldiers, one by Antonius, and the third by Anatolius my
servant; two of them were a salutary medicine capable of reviving any one who was desponding
or stumbling, and conducting him into a healthy state of serenity. When you have received
these letters then go over them constantly and thoroughly, and you will perceive their force
and enjoy experience of their healing power, and benefit, and will inform me that you have
derived much advantage therefrom. I have also a third letter ready, similar to these, which

<pb n="420"/>
I do not choose to send at the present time having been exceedingly vexed at your saying
“I accumulate sorrowful thoughts, even inventing things which do not exist,” an utterance
unworthy of yourself, which makes me hide my head for shame. But read those letters which
I have sent, and you will no longer say these things, even if you are infinitely bent on being
despondent.955 I at least have not ceased, and will not cease saying that sin is the only thing
which is really distressing; and that all other things are but dust and smoke. For what is
there grievous in inhabiting a prison and wearing a chain? or in being ill-treated when it is
the occasion of so much gain? or why should exile be grievous or confiscation of goods?
These are mere words, destitute of any terrible reality, words void of sorrow. For if you
speak of death you only mention that which is the debt of nature: a thing which must in any
case be undergone even if no one hastens it: and if you speak of exile you mention that which
only involves a change of country and the sight of many cities: or if you speak of confiscation
of goods you mention what is only freedom and emancipation from care.</p>
<p>5. Do not cease to pay attention to Maruthas the Bishop, as far as it concerns you, so as
to lift him up out of the pit.956 For I have special need of him on account of the affairs in
Persia. And ascertain from him, if you can, what has been accomplished there through his
agency, and for what purpose he has come home, and let me know whether you have delivered
the two epistles which I sent to him: and if he is willing to write to me, I will write
again to him: but if he should not be willing let him at least signify to your prudence
whether any thing more has taken place there, and whether he is likely to accomplish anything
by going thither again. For on this account I was anxious to have an interview with him.
Nevertheless let all things which depend on you be done, and take care to fulfill your own
part, even if all men are rushing headlong to ruin. For your reward will thus be perfected.
By all means therefore make friends with him as far as it is possible. I beseech you not to
neglect what I am about to say, but to pay diligent heed to it. The Marsian and Gothic monks
where the Bishop Serapion has constantly been concealed have informed me that Moduarius
the deacon has come bringing word that Unilas, that excellent bishop whom I lately ordained
and sent into Gothia, has been laid to rest, after achieving many great exploits: and
the deacon was the bearer of a letter from the king of the Goths begging that a bishop might
be sent to them. Since then I see no other means of meeting the threatened catastrophe with
<note type="footnote">955 A short passage is omitted here in the translation. It refers to the transaction of some business between

<note type="footnote">956 He means, “to detach him from the influence of the hostile party.” Maruthas was Bishop of Martyropolis
in Persia. He had taken part in one of the synods at Constantinople which condemned Chrysostom; had returned
to Persia, and after doing good work there had revisited Constantinople, and Chrysostom seems to have hopes
of reclaiming him to his side.</note>

<pb n="421"/>
a view to its correction save delay and postponement (as it is impossible for them to sail
into the Bosporus or into those parts at the present time), take measures to put them off for
a time on account of the winter season: and do not by any means neglect this: for it is a
matter of the greatest importance. For there are two things which would specially distress
me if they were to happen, which God forbid: one is that a bishop should be appointed by
these men who have wrought such great wickedness,957 and who have no right to appoint,
and the other is that any one should be made without consideration. For you know yourself
that they are not anxious to create some worthy man bishop, and if this should take place,
which heaven forbid, you are aware what will follow. Use all diligence therefore to prevent
either of these things happening: but if it were possible for Moduarius quietly and secretly
to hasten out to me it would be of the greatest advantage. But if this is not possible let what
is practicable under the circumstances be done. For that which takes place in the case of
money, and actually occurred in the case of the widow in the gospel, also holds good in the
case of practical affairs. For as that poor woman when she had cast two mites into the
treasury surpassed all those who had cast in more, because she used up her whole substance:
even so they who devote themselves to the work in hand with all their might discharge it
completely, so far as they are concerned, even if nothing results from it, and they have their
reward perfected.</p>
<p>I am very grateful to Hilarius the bishop: for he wrote to me asking to be allowed to
depart to his own country, and to set things in order there, and then to come back again.
As his presence therefore is of great service (for he is a devout, inflexible, and zealous man)
I have urged him to depart and to return speedily. Take care then that the letter is quickly
and safely delivered to him and not cast on one side: for he eagerly and earnestly begged for
letters from me, and his presence is a great benefit. By all means therefore have a care of the
letters; and if Helladius the presbyter be not on the spot see that they are delivered to my
friends by the hands of some discreet man who has a head on his shoulders.</p>

<p>Nothing strange or unnatural has befallen your Piety, but only what is quite natural and
consonant to reason, that by a constant succession of trials the sinews of your soul should
become more braced, and your zeal and energy for the struggle increased, and that you
should therefrom derive much joy. For such is the nature of affliction;—when it lays hold
of a brave and noble soul, this is what it is wont to effect. And as the fire makes the piece of
gold, when it is applied to it, of better proof: so also affliction when it visits golden characters
renders them purer and more proven. Wherefore also Paul said “affliction worketh patience,
and patience probation.”958 For these reasons I also rejoice and leap for joy, and derive the
greatest consolation of this my solitude from a consideration of thy fortitude. On this account,
even though innumerable wolves encompass thee, and many crowds of wicked doers, I fear
nothing; but I pray both that existing temptations may be suppressed, and that others may
not occur, thus fulfilling the Lord’s precept who bids us pray that we may not enter into
temptation; but if it should be permitted to happen again I have good confidence concerning
thy golden soul, which acquires therefrom the greatest riches for itself. For by what means
will they be able to terrify you, who dare everything to their own destruction? Will it be by
loss of goods? But I know well that these are counted by thee as dust and cheaper than dirt.
Or shall it be by expulsion from country and home. But you know how to dwell in great
and populous cities as if they were uninhabited, spending the whole of your time in quietness
and rest, and treading worldly ambitions under foot. Or do they threaten death? This also
you have constantly practiced by anticipation, and if they should drag you to slaughter, they
will be dragging a body which is already dead. What need to speak more at length? No one
will be able to do anything to thee of this kind which he will not find you have already
abundantly made yourself undergo. For by always walking in the narrow and strait path,
you have trained yourself in all these things. Wherefore having practised this most beautiful
art in the course of your training, you now shine forth the more gloriously in the contest
itself, not only being in no wise disturbed by the things which are happening, but rather
elated, and leaping and dancing for joy. For the contests which you have anticipated in your
training you now undertake with much ease, although it be in a woman’s body, feebler than
a cobweb, treading under foot with derisive scorn the fury of lusty men gnashing their teeth
upon you; being ready to suffer even worse things than they prepare for you. Happy and
thrice happy are you by reason of the crowns of victory to be won, but even more by reason
of the contest itself. For such is the nature of these struggles, even before the prizes are given
even in the midst of strife they have their recompense and reward;—the pleasure which you
are now enjoying, the cheerfulness, the courage, the endurance, the patience, the power
which is proof against capture and conquest and rises superior to all things; the perfect
<note type="footnote">958 Rom. v. 3, 4.</note>

<pb n="423"/>
training which renders you insensible to any terror at the hands of any one, the power of
standing on a rock in the midst of mighty billows of tribulation, and sailing in a calm with
a favourable breeze when the sea is raging around you. These are the prizes of affliction even
in this world before the kingdom of heaven is won. For I know very well that, even at this
present time, being elated with joy, thou dost not consider thyself clothed with a body, but
if an opportunity should summon thee to do it, thou wouldst divest thyself of it more
readily than others do of the raiment which they wear. Rejoice therefore and be glad both
for thyself, and for those who have died a blessed death, not in a bed, nor in a house, but in
prison, and chains, and torment; and bewail those only who do these things, and grieve for
them. But since you also wish to be informed concerning my bodily health, let me tell you
that I have been relieved for the present from the infirmity which was lately oppressing me,
and am now in a more comfortable condition: the only fear is lest the winter on its return
should again make havoc of my feeble digestion; and as far as the Isaurians are concerned
we now enjoy great security.</p>

<pb n="424"/>
<p>The following letter is added as a specimen, out of a very large number, of the natural,
almost playful style, and tone of warm affection, in which Chrysostom wrote to his intimate
friends. All his extant letters were written during his exile, and therefore there is much repetition
in their contents, and great general similarity of character.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="6">
<head>to castus, valerius, diophantus, cyriacus

<p>I am not surprised that you call my long letter a short one. For this is just the way with
lovers; they do not recognize such a thing as satiety, they will not admit such a thing as satisfaction,
but the more they receive from the objects of their love the more they seek.
Therefore, even if the letter which you have received had been ten times as large as the
former one, it would not have escaped the epithet of “brief;” in fact it would have been called
a small letter, and not only would it have been so called, but it would have actually seemed
such in your eyes. Hence I also in my turn am never satisfied with the measure of affection
for me which you have attained, but am always seeking to make additions to your lovedraught,
and daily demanding the discharge of your love debt which is always being paid,
and yet is always owing (for it is written, “owe no man anything but to love one another”959).
I am indeed continually receiving what I ask in great abundance, yet never think that I have
received the whole. Do not cease then to pay down this goodly debt, which has a twofold
pleasure. For those who pay, and those who receive, derive equal enjoyment, inasmuch as
they are both alike enriched by the payment; which in the case of money is an impossibility,
for there the one who pays becomes poorer, and only the man who has received is richer.
But this is not what commonly happens in the covenant of love. For he who pays it is not
less bereft of it, as in the case of money when it is transferred to the receiver; but payment
of love makes him who pays richer than before. Knowing these things then, O Sirs, most
honoured and devout, cease not continually displaying this excellent disposition towards
me. For although you need no exhortation for this purpose from me yet as I greatly long
for your love I remind you, even when you need it not, both in order that you may constantly
write to me, and also inform me of the state of your health. For even if you do not need any
one to remind you on this account, I shall not desist from continually seeking this at your
hands; as it is a matter which I have very much at heart. That it is a difficult task owing both
to the season of the year, and the difficulty of the journey, and the scarcity of travellers who
will do this service for you I am well aware: nevertheless as far as is possible and practicable
in the midst of so much difficulty, we exhort you to write constantly, and crave this favour
from your love.</p>

<p>CORRESPONDENCE OF ST. CHRYSOSTOM WITH
THE BISHOP OF ROME</p>
<p>TRANSLATED WITH INTRODUCTION AND NOTES BY

<pb n="426"/>
<head>INTRODUCTION TO THE CORRESPONDENCE OF ST.
CHRYSOSTOM, AND THE CHURCH AT CONSTANTINOPLE,
WITH INNOCENT, BISHOP OF ROME.</head>
<p>Of these four letters the last three were written during the final exile of St. Chrysostom
from Constantinople. The first was written a few weeks before his departure. The complication
of events which led to that exile cannot be unfolded here. The student will find a full
account of them in most historians of this period of the Church, both ancient and modern,
and in the Life of St. Chrysostom by the editor of this volume chapters XVI–XIX. It must
suffice to say here that Theophilus Patriarch of Alexandria having been summoned by an
imperial mandate to Constantinople to be tried on the charge of having cruelly ill-treated
certain Egyptian monks, formed a cabal amongst the enemies of St. Chrysostom, and artfully
contrived to change his own position from that of the accused into that of the accuser. His
devices were in the end only too successful, and in the summer of the year 404 St. Chrysostom
was driven from his see, never to return.</p>
<p>The first letter of St. Chrysostom seems to have been written soon after Easter 404 and
refers to the events immediately preceding his expulsion.</p>
<p>The second was written, as we learn from the letter itself, after he had entered the third
year of his exile, probably near the close of the year 406.</p>
<p>Copies of the first letter were addressed also to Venerius Bishop of Milan, and Chromatius
Bishop of Aquileia. It is interesting therefore as indicating the relation between the
Eastern and Western branches of the Church at the beginning of the fifth century. On the
one hand it illustrates the growing tendency of Christendom to appeal to the authority of
the Western Church, especially of the Bishop of Rome, on questions of ecclesiastical discipline.
The law-making, law-protecting spirit of the West is invoked to restrain the turbulence
and licentiousness of the East. No jealousy is entertained of the Patriarch of the old Rome
by the Patriarch of the new. But on the other hand it is to be noted that the Bishop of Rome
is in no sense addressed as a supreme arbitrator: aid and sympathy are solicited from him
as from an elder brother, and two other prelates of Italy are joint recipients with him of the
appeal.</p>
<p>To Chrysostom Innocent writes, as friend to friend and bishop to brother bishop, a
letter of Christian consolation and encouragement, not entering into the legal questions of
the case, and not pledging himself to decisive action of any kind. In his letter to the Church
of Constantinople he denounces the illegality of the late proceedings of Theophilus and his
accomplices, in the strongest terms; but insists upon the necessity of convoking an oecumenical
council as the only means of allaying the tempest. And it must be allowed that he did
his best to accomplish this object. He wrote a letter to Honorius, the Emperor of the Western
Empire, who resided at Ravenna, describing the pitiable condition of the Church at Con-

<pb n="427"/>
stantinople. The Emperor issued an order for the convention of an Italian synod, and the
synod, swayed no doubt by Innocent, requested Honorius to write to his brother Arcadius
the Eastern Emperor urging the convention of a general council to be held in Thessalonica
which would be a convenient meeting-point for the prelates of East and West. Honorius
complied, and the letter was despatched under the care of a deputation from the Italian
Church, consisting of five bishops, two priests and a deacon. They were the bearers also of
letters from Innocent, and the Bishops of Milan and Aquileia, and of a memorial from the
Italian synod, recommending that Chrysostom should be reinstated in his see before he was
required to take his trial before the Council. The party hostile to Chrysostom however had
now such complete sway over the court at Constantinople that the deputation never succeeded
in getting an audience with the Emperor, and after suffering many insults and indignities,
returned to Italy without having accomplished anything.</p>
<p>The letters of Innocent were probably written in Latin, and afterwards translated into
Greek. The Greek version is in several passages clumsy and obscure.</p>

<head>CORRESPONDENCE OF ST. CHRYSOSTOM WITH
THE BISHOP OF ROME.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>letter from st. john chrysostom to innocent, bishop of rome.</head>
<p>To my lord, the most reverend and divinely beloved bishop Innocent, John sends greeting in
the Lord.</p>
<p>1. I suppose that even before receiving our letter your Piety has heard of the iniquity
which has been perpetrated here. For the magnitude of our distress has left scarcely a single
portion of the world uninformed of this grievous tragedy: for report carrying the tidings of
what has happened to the very extremities of the earth, has everywhere caused great
mourning and lamentation. But inasmuch as we ought not to mourn, but to restore order,
and to see by what means this most grievous storm of the Church may be stayed, we have
deemed it necessary to persuade my lords, the most honoured and pious bishops Demetrius,
Pansophius, Pappus and Eugenius to leave their own churches, and venture on this great
sea voyage, and set out on a long journey from home, and hasten to your Charity, and, after
informing you clearly of everything, to take measures for redressing the evils as speedily as
possible. And with them we have sent the most honoured and beloved of our Deacons,
Paulus and Cyriacus, but we also ourselves, in the form of a letter, will briefly instruct your
Charity concerning the things which have come to pass. For Theophilus, who has been entrusted
with the presidency of the Church in Alexandria, having been commanded to repair
alone to Constantinople, certain men having brought an accusation against him to the most
devout Emperor, arrived bringing with him no small multitude of Egyptian Bishops, as if
wishing to show from the outset, that he came for war and antagonism; moreover when he
set foot in the great and divinely beloved Constantinople he did not enter the Church according
to the custom and the law which has prevailed from ancient time, he held no intercourse
with us, and admitted us to no share in his conversation, his prayers, or his society:
but as soon as he disembarked, having hurried past the vestibule of the Church, he departed
and lodged somewhere outside the city, and although we earnestly entreated him, and those
who had come with him, to be our guests (for everything had been made ready, and lodgings
provided, and whatever was suitable) neither they, nor he consented. We seeing this, were
in great perplexity, not being able to discover the cause of this unjust hostility; nevertheless
we discharged our part, doing what became us, and continually beseeching him to meet us
and to say for what cause he hazarded so great a contest at the outset, and threw the city
into such confusion. But as he did not choose to state the reason, and those who accused

<pb n="429"/>
him were urgent, our most devout Emperor summoned us and commanded us to go outside
the walls to the place where Theophilus was sojourning, and hear the argument against him.
For they accused him of assault, and slaughter and countless other crimes; but knowing as
we did the laws of the fathers, and paying respect and deference to the man, and having also
his own letters which prove that lawsuits ought not to be taken beyond the border, but that
affairs of the several provinces should be treated within the limits of the province, we would
not accept the office of judge, but deprecated it with great earnestness. But he, as if striving
to aggravate the former insults, having summoned my archdeacon, by a stretch of arbitrary
power, as if the Church were already widowed, and had no bishop, by means of this man
seduced all the clergy to his own side; and the Churches became destitute, as the clergy in
each were gradually withdrawn, and instructed to hand in petitions against us, and trained
to prepare accusations. And having done this he sent and summoned us to trial, although
he had not yet cleared himself of the charges brought against him, a proceeding directly
contrary to the canons and to all the laws.</p>
<p>2. But we being aware that we were not cited to a trial (for otherwise we would have
presented ourselves any number of times) but to the presence of an enemy and an adversary,
as was clearly proved by all which occurred both before and after, despatched certain bishops
to him, Demetrius of Pesinus, Eulysius of Apamea, Lupicinus of Appiaria,960 and the presbyters
Germanus and Severus, who replied with the moderation which became us, and said,
that we did not decline to be judged, but to appear before an open enemy, and manifest
adversary. For how could one who had not yet received any bills of indictment against me,
and had acted from the outset in the manner described, and severed himself from the Church,
from communion, and from prayer, and was training accusers, and seducing the clergy, and
desolating the Church, how, I say, could he with justice mount the throne of the judge which
was not in any sense befitting him? For it is not suitable that one who belongs to Egypt
should act as judge of those who are in Thrace, and this a man who is himself under an accusation,
and an enemy and adversary. Nevertheless he, in no way abashed, but hurrying
on to the completion of his design, although we had declared our readiness to clear ourselves
of the charges in the presence of a hundred yea or a thousand bishops, and to prove ourselves
innocent as indeed we are, would not consent: but in our absence, when we were appealing
to a synod, and demanding a trial, and not shrinking from a hearing of our cause, but only
from open enmity, he both received our accusers and absolved those who had been excommunicated
by me, and from them, who had not yet cleared themselves of the offences laid
to their charge, he received complaints961 against me, and had minutes made of the proceedings,
all which things are contrary to law, and the order of the canons. But what need is
<note type="footnote">960 Pesinus was in Galatia, Apamea in Bithynia, Appiaria I have not identified.</note>
<note type="footnote">961 Libellos, a technical word signifying a formal petition of complaint or accusation.</note>

<pb n="430"/>
there of a long story? He did not cease doing and contriving everything until, with all possible
display of arbitrary power and authority, he ejected us from the city and the church, when
the evening was far advanced and all the people were streaming after us. Being drawn by
the public informer962 through the midst of the city, and dragged along by force I was taken
down to the sea, and thrust on board ship, and made a night voyage, because I appealed to
a synod for a just hearing of my cause. Who could hear these things without tears, even if
he had a heart of stone?</p>
<p>But seeing, as I said before, that we ought not merely to lament the evils which have
been done, but also to amend them, I beseech your Charity to rouse yourself and have
compassion, and do everything so as to put a stop to the mischief at this point. For even
after what I have mentioned he did not desist from his deeds of iniquity, but sought to renew
the former attack. For when the most devout Emperor had turned out those who shamelessly
rushed into the Church, and many of the Bishops present seeing their iniquity had retreated
into their own dioceses, flying from the incursion of these men as from a fire devouring all
things, we were again invited to the city, and to the Church, from which we had been unjustly
expelled, more than thirty bishops introducing us, and our most pious Emperor sending a
notary for this purpose, while Theophilus immediately took to flight. For what purpose,
and from what cause? When we entered the city we besought our most pious Emperor to
convene a synod for prosecuting the offenders in the late transactions. Being conscious
therefore of what he had done, and dreading conviction, the imperial letters having been
sent in every direction, convoking all men from all quarters, Theophilus secretly at midnight
flung himself into a boat, and so made his escape, taking all his company with him.</p>
<p>3. But even then we did not desist, supported as we were by a clear conscience, from
making the same supplication again to the most devout Emperor: and he, acting as became
his piety, sent to Theophilus again, summoning him from Egypt, and his associates, in order
to give an account of the late proceedings, and informing him that he was not to suppose
that the one-sided deeds which he had so unjustly perpetrated in our absence, and in violation
of so many canons, would suffice for his defence. He did not however submit to the royal
mandate, but remained at home, alleging an insurrection of the people in excuse, and the
unseasonable zeal of certain persons who were attached to him, as he pretended: and yet
before the arrival of the imperial letters this same people had deluged him with abuse. But
we do not make much of these matters now, but have said what we have said as wishing to
prove the fact that he was arrested in his mischievous course. Yet even after these things we
did not rest, but were urgent in our demand that a tribunal should be formed for the purpose
of enquiry and defence: for we said that we were ready to prove that we ourselves were
guiltless, but that they had flagrantly transgressed. For there were some Syrians amongst
<note type="footnote">962 Curiosus, an official whose duty it was to investigate charges, and inform the Emperor of offenders.</note>

<pb n="431"/>
those present with him at that time, who were left behind here; and we accosted them expressing
our readiness to plead our cause, and frequently importuned them on this behalf,
demanding that the minutes (of the late transactions) should be given up to us, or that the
formal bills of indictment, or the nature of the charges, or the accusers themselves, should
be made known; and yet we did not obtain any of these things, but were again expelled from
the Church. How am I to relate the events which followed, transcending as they do every
kind of tragedy? What language will set forth these events? what kind of ear will receive
them without shuddering? For when we were urging these things, as I said before, a dense
troop of soldiers, on the great Sabbath itself,963 as the day was hastening towards eventide,
having broken into the Churches violently drove out all the clergy who were with us, and
surrounded the sanctuary with arms. And women from the oratories964 who had stripped
themselves for baptism just at that time, fled unclothed, from terror at this grievous assault,
not being permitted to put on the modest apparel which befits women; indeed many received
wounds before they were expelled, and the baptismal pools were filled with blood, and the
sacred water reddened by it. Nor did the distress cease even at this point; but the soldiers,
some of whom as we understand were unbaptized, having entered the place where the sacred
vessels were stored, saw all the things which were inside it, and the most holy blood of Christ,
as might happen in the midst of such confusion, was spilt upon the garments of the soldiers
aforesaid: and every kind of outrage was committed as in a barbarian siege. And the common
people were driven to the wilderness, and all the people tarried outside the city, and the
Churches became empty in the midst of this great Festival, and more than forty bishops
who associated with us were vainly and causelessly expelled together with the people and
clergy. And there were shrieks and lamentations, and torrents of tears were shed everywhere,
in the market places, in the houses, in the desert places, and every part of the city was filled
with these calamities; for owing to the immoderate extent of the outrage not only the sufferers,
but also they who did not undergo anything of the kind sympathized with us, not only
those who held the same opinions as ours, but also heretics, and Jews, and Greeks, and all
places were in a state of tumult and confusion, and lamentation, as if the city had been
captured by force. And these things were perpetrated contrary to the intention of our most
pious Emperor, under cover of night, the Bishops contriving them, and in many places
conducting the attack, nor were they ashamed to have sergeants965 instead of deacons
<note type="footnote">963 i. e., Easter Eve.</note>
<note type="footnote">964 οἶκοι ἐυκτήριοι. Churches were sometimes so called, more often, however, private chapels as distinguished
from parish churches. The meaning here is not very obvious; perhaps some chambers attached to the Church,
where catechumens prayed before baptism, are referred to.</note>
<note type="footnote">965 Campiductores—their special business was to drill recruits.</note>

<pb n="432"/>
marching in front of them. And when day dawned all the city was migrating outside the
walls under trees and groves, celebrating the festival, like scattered sheep.</p>
<p>4. All which happened afterwards I leave you to imagine; for as I said before it is not
possible to describe each separate incident. The worst of it is that these evils, great and serious
as they are, have not even now been suppressed nor is there any hope of their suppression;
on the contrary the mischief is extending itself every day, and we have become a laughing
stock to the multitude, or rather I should say, no one laughs even if he is infinitely lawless,
but all men mourn, as I was saying, this new kind of lawlessness, the finishing stroke of all
our ills.</p>
<p>What is one to say to the disorders in the other Churches? For the evil did not stop even
here, but made its way to the east. For as when some evil humor is discharged from the
head, all the other parts are corrupted, so now also these evils, having originated in this great
city as from a fountain, confusion has spread in every direction, and clergy have everywhere
made insurrection against bishops, there has been schism between bishop and bishop, people
and people, and will be yet more; every place is suffering from the throes of calamity, and
the subversion of the whole civilized world. Having been informed then of all these things,
my lords, most honourable and devout, exhibit the courage and zeal which becomes you,
so as to put a stop to this great assault of lawlessness which has been made upon the Churches.
For if this custom were to prevail, and it became lawful for any persons who desired it to
enter strange dioceses, so widely separated, and expel those whom one wished to remove,
and do whatever they pleased according to their own arbitrary power, be assured that all
things will go to ruin, and an implacable kind of war will overrun the whole world, all men
attacking others, and being in turn attacked. Therefore to prevent such confusion overtaking
the whole earth yield to our entreaties that ye will signify by writing that these lawless
transactions executed in our absence, and after hearing one side only, although we did not
decline a trial, are invalid, as indeed they are by the very nature of the case, and that those
who are convicted of having committed such iniquities must be subjected to the penalty of
the ecclesiastical laws; and for ourselves, who have not been detected or convicted, or proved
liable to punishment may we continue to have the benefit of your correspondence, and your
love, and all other things which we have enjoyed aforetime. But if even now those who have
committed such lawless acts are willing to disclose the charges on the strength of which they
have unjustly expelled us, neither memoranda, nor formal bills of indictment being given,
nor the accusers having appeared: yet if an impartial tribunal is formed, we will submit to
be tried, and will make our defence, and prove ourselves guiltless of the things laid to our
charge, as indeed we are: for the things which they have done are outside the bounds of
every kind of order, and every kind of ecclesiastical law and canon. And why do I say ecclesiastical
canon? Not even in the heathen courts would such audacious deeds ever have been
committed, or rather not even in a barbarian court, neither Scythians, nor Sarmatians would

<pb n="433"/>
ever have judged a cause in this fashion, deciding it after hearing one side only, in the absence
of the accused, who only deprecated enmity, not a trial of his case, who was ready to call
any number of judges, asserting himself to be innocent and able to clear himself of the
charges in the face of the world, and prove himself guiltless in every respect.</p>
<p>Having considered therefore all these things, and having been clearly informed of all
particulars by my lords, our most devout brethren the bishops, may you be induced to exert
your zeal on our behalf; for in so doing ye will confer a favour not upon ourselves alone but
also upon the Church at large, and ye will receive your reward from God who does all things
for the peace of the Churches. Fare thee well always, and pray for me, most honoured and
holy master.</p>

<head>to innocent, bishop of rome, greeting in the lord.</head>
<p>Our body it is true is settled in one place, but the pinion of love wings its way round
every part of the world. Even so we also although we be separated by a journey of such great
extent are nigh to your Piety, and in daily communion with you, beholding with the eyes
of love the courage of your soul, the sterling nature of your disposition, your firmness and
inflexibility, the great consolation, constant and abiding, which you bestow upon us. For in
proportion as the billows mount higher, and concealed reefs increase, and the hurricanes
are many does your vigilance wax stronger: and neither the great length of the journey
between us, nor the large amount of time consumed, nor the difficulty in dealing with events
has disposed you to become supine: but ye continue to imitate the best class of pilots who
are on the alert at those times most especially when they see the waves crested, the sea
swelling, the water dashing vehemently, and the deepest darkness in day-time. Therefore
also we feel great gratitude towards you, and we long to send you showers of letters, thus
affording ourselves the greatest gratification. But since we are deprived of this, owing to the
desolation of the place; (for not only of those who arrive from your regions, but even of
those who dwell in our part of the world no one could easily have intercourse with us, both
on account of the distance, the spot in which we are confined being situated at the very extremity
of the country, and also the terror of robbers acting as a bar to the whole journey:)
we beseech you rather to pity us because of our long silence, than to condemn us for indolence
on that account. For as a proof that our silence has not been due to negligence, we have now
at last after a long time secured our most honoured and beloved John the presbyter, and
Paul the deacon, and we send a letter through them, and continue to express our gratitude
to you, that you have surpassed even affectionate parents in your good will and zeal concerning
us. And indeed so far as your Piety is concerned all things would have been duly amended,
and the accumulation of evils and offences have been swept away, and the Churches would
have enjoyed peace and a glassy calm, and all things would have floated along with a smooth
stream, and the despised laws and violated decrees of the fathers would have been vindicated.
But since in reality none of these things has taken place, they who perpetrated the former
deeds striving to aggravate their former iniquities, I omit any detailed narrative of their
subsequent proceedings: for the narrative would exceed the limits not merely of a letter but
even of a history; only this I beseech your vigilant soul, even if they who have filled everything
with confusion be impenitently and incurably corrupt, let not those who have undertaken
to cure them become faint-hearted or despondent, when they consider the magnitude of
the thing to be accomplished. For the contest now before you has to be fought on behalf of
nearly the whole world, on behalf of Churches humbled to the ground, of people dispersed,
of clergy assaulted, of bishops sent into exile, of ancestral laws violated. Wherefore we beseech
your Diligence, once, twice, yea many times, in proportion as the storm increases, to manifest
still greater zeal. For we expect that something more will be done for the purpose of

<pb n="435"/>
amending these wrongs. But even if this should not take place, ye at least have your crown
made ready for you by the merciful God, and the resistance offered by your love will be no
small consolation to those who are wronged: for now that we are passing the third year of
our sojourn in exile exposed to famine, pestilence, wars, continual sieges, indescribable
solitude, daily death, and Isaurian swords, we are not a little encouraged and comforted by
the constant and abiding nature of your disposition and confidence, and by revelling in
your abundant and genuine love. This is our wall of defence, this is our security, this our
calm haven, this our treasure of infinite blessings, this our gladness, and ground of much
joy. And even if we should be carried off again to some spot more desolate than this, we
shall carry this love away with us as no small consolation of our sufferings.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="3">
<pb n="436"/>
<head>to the beloved brother john, innocent.</head>
<p>Although the innocent man ought to expect all good things, and to crave mercy from
God, nevertheless we also, counselling resignation, have sent an appropriate letter by the
hands of Cyriacus the deacon; so that insolence may not have more power in oppressing,
than a good conscience has in retaining hope. For thou who art the teacher and pastor of
so many people needest not to be taught that the best men are ever frequently put to the
test whether they will persevere in the perfection of patience, and not succumb to any toil
of distress: and certainly conscience is a strong defence against all things which unjustly
befall us: and unless any one conquer these by patient endurance he supplies an argument
for evil surmising. For he ought to endure all things who trusts first of all in God, and then
in his own conscience; seeing that the noble and good man can be specially trained to endurance,
inasmuch as the holy Scriptures guard his mind; and the sacred lessons which we
deliver to the people abound in examples, testifying as they do that nearly all the saints have
been continually oppressed in divers ways, and are tested as by a kind of scrutiny, and so
attain to the crown of patience. Let conscience itself console thy love, most honoured
brother, which in affliction supplies the consolation of virtue. For under the eye of the
Master Christ, the conscience, having been purged, will find rest in the haven of peace.</p>

have placed before my eyes, and by repeated perusal of your description I thoroughly perceived
under what great distress and toil your faith is labouring: and this is a matter which
can be cured only by the consolation of patience: for our God will speedily grant an end to
such great afflictions, and He will aid you in your endurance of these things. Moreover
whilst praising the statement of your case which contains many testimonies encouraging
to patience I notice this necessary consolation placed at the beginning of the epistle of your
love: for the consolation which we ought to have written to you, ye have anticipated by your
letter. For this is the kind of patience which our Master is wont to supply to those who are
in distress, in order that the servants of Christ when they are in affliction may console
themselves by reflecting that the things which they themselves are suffering have happened
to the saints also in former times. And we also from your letter shall be able to derive consolation:
for we are not estranged from sympathy with you, inasmuch as we also are chastised
in your persons. For who will be able to endure the offences committed by those men who
ought to be specially zealous promoters of the tranquillity of the Church and of concord itself.
At the present time, by a perversion of custom, guiltless priests are expelled from the pres-
idency of their own Churches. And this is what your chief brother, and fellow minister,
John, your bishop has unjustly suffered, not having obtained any hearing: no crime is charged
against him, none is heard. And what is the object of this iniquitous device? that no pretext
for a trial may occur, or be sought, other men are introduced into the places of living priests,
as if those who start from an offence of this description could be judged by any one to have
anything good or to have done anything right.966 For we understand that such deeds have
never been perpetrated by our fathers; or rather that they were prevented by the fact that
no one had authority given him to ordain another to take the place of one who was still living.
For a spurious ordination cannot deprive the priest of his rank: seeing that neither can he
be a bishop who is wrongfully substituted for another. And as regards the observance of the
canons we lay it down that we ought to follow those, which were defined at Nicæa, to which
alone the Catholic Church is bound to pay obedience and recognition. And if others are
brought forward by certain men, which are at variance with the canons framed at Nicæa,
and are proved to have been composed by heretics, let them be rejected by the Catholic
bishops. For the inventions of heretics ought not to be appended to the Catholic canons;
for by their adverse and unlawful decrees they are always intending to weaken the design
<note type="footnote">966 I have followed the Latin here. The Greek version of the passage seems to me hopelessly confused.</note>

<pb n="438"/>
of the canons of Nicæa. Not only therefore do we say that these ought not to be followed,
but rather that they should be condemned amongst heretical and schismatic decrees, as was
formerly done in the Council of Sardica by the bishops who were before us.967 For it were
more fitting, most honoured brethren, that good deeds should be condemned than that
things done in direct opposition to the canons should have any validity. But what are we to
do against such things at the present time? A synodical decision of them is necessary, and
we have long declared that a synod ought to be convened, as it is the only means of allaying
the agitation of such tempests as these: and if we obtain this it is expedient that the healing
of these evils should be committed to the will of the great God, and His Christ our Lord. All
the disturbances then which have been caused by the envy of the devil for the probation of
the faithful will be mitigated; through the firmness of our faith we ought not to despair of
anything from the Lord. For we ourselves also are considering much by what means the
oecumenical synod may be brought together in order that by the will of God these disturbing
movements may be brought to an end. Let us therefore endure for a while, and fortified by
the wall of patience let us hope that all things may be restored to us by the assistance of our
God. Moreover all things which ye say ye have undergone we have learned by accurate enquiry
from our fellow bishops who have already taken refuge in Rome, although for the
most part at different times, that is to say, Demetrius, Cyriacus, Eulysius and Palladius, who
are here with us.</p>
<note type="footnote">967 The Council of Sardica was convened A.D. 343, (or A.D. 344?) with a view of settling the Arian controversy.
The Oriental bishops, however, of whom the majority belonged to the Arian faction, seceded from Sardica, and
held a separate council at Philippopolis, where they drew up a creed which was condemned by the Western
bishops as heretical.</note>

<p>ST. CHRYSOSTOM:
THE HOMILIES ON THE STATUES
TO THE PEOPLE OF ANTIOCH.</p>
<p>THE OXFORD TRANSLATION AND NOTES, REVISED BY
REV. W. R. W. STEPHENS, M.A.,
PREBENDARY OF CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL, AND RECTOR OF WOOLBEDING,

<head>PREFACE TO THE BENEDICTINE EDITION.</head>
<p>1. Among the events which occurred in the time of John Chrysostom,968 there is none
more memorable than that sedition of the inhabitants of Antioch, in which the Statues of
the Emperor Theodosius and Flacilla his wife were thrown down and dragged about the
city, at which Theodosius was so exasperated, as even to think of destroying the city entirely.
This afforded ample matter for our Chrysostom to exercise his powers of preaching. For as
the people of Antioch were fluctuating between hope and fear (sudden accidents offering
of course daily some fresh cause for hope or alarm) Chrysostom, compelled as he was to
adapt his style to circumstances as they arose, almost always without preparation, delivered
on the spur of the occasion these Homilies, which are certainly well deserving of admiration.
At one time his object here is to console a people struggling with present distress; at another,
to strengthen minds that were sinking under the extremity of danger; and above all, by repeated
admonition, to persuade the people of Antioch, on occasion of the threatened
calamities, to correct the vices and to wipe away the crimes that had thus provoked God’s
wrath; which endeavour on the part of Chrysostom certainly ended in results agreeable to
his desire, as he sometimes acknowledges.</p>
<p>2. But the cause of this great sedition was, according to the testimony of Zosimus, excess
of taxation, which was daily inventing new imposts; an exaction required either for the celebration
of the fifth year upon which Arcadius had entered, from the time he was proclaimed
under the title of Augustus, and the tenth year of the Emperor Theodosius, commencing
in the year 388, or for the expenses of the war against the tyrant Maximus,969 or on account
of both these events, as well as for other necessities of the state. The people of Antioch, that
is to say, the superior class of the citizens, dismayed at the burden of this impost, first approached
the prefect, and with tears lamented the excess of the tax that had been announced,
and implored the Divine assistance. And next, a multitude of vagabonds and foreigners of
the lowest class of the people,970 in a state of excited feeling, broke out into deeds of violence.
At first they turned every thing upside down in the public baths; hence they proceeded to
the prefect’s palace, and attacked the doors and windows, and were scarcely repelled, when
they turned their rage in another direction, and attacked the painted tablets of the Emperors
with stones, covered them with filth, and reduced them to a ruinous condition, while they
loaded the Augusti themselves with curses and reproaches. At length they threw down the
Statues of the Emperor Theodosius and Flacilla his deceased wife,971 and dragged them

through the streets of the city; and had already commenced further outrages, when they
were put down by a band of archers, dispatched from the prefect. The sedition being thus
extinguished, fear took the place of madness, and the expectation of impending punishment
caused the burdensome tax that had been imposed to be entirely forgotten. What followed
afterwards will be narrated below in the review of the Homilies. Something must now be
said as to the year of the sedition, in which these Homilies were delivered.</p>
<p>3. Dismissing the narrative of Sozomen and Theodoret, according to whose account,
this sedition, and the delivery of these discourses, must have been after the war against
Maximus, learned men, and Tillemont especially (at length in note 27 appended to his Life
of the Emperor Theodosius) have proved from far more certain notes of time, that these
events took place before the war against Maximus. In opposition to that former opinion,
he produces a most convincing argument from Chrysostom’s own words, who in the sixteenth
Homily (No. 2.), testifies that this was the second year since he had begun to preach; but he
began when he was first ordained presbyter at the end of the year 385, or at the beginning
of 386. Wherefore these discourses ought to be attributed either to the year 388, or rather
387. For the former opinion Baronius contends, and after him, Petavius and Henry Valesius,
who assign them to the year 388, for this reason, that the tenth year of the reign of
Theodosius then commenced, for the celebration of which the tax before mentioned was
imposed. But what is adduced from Libanius for the defence of this opinion is full of perplexity,
972 and is capable of being twisted to support either opinion. A still more certain
indication than any of these is gathered from the circumstance, that the Emperor
Theodosius was certainly at Constantinople during the winter and Lent of the year 387, in
which year also the sedition must necessarily have occurred; for at the time of the sedition
he was most certainly staying at Constantinople,973 but on the other hand at the same season
in the year immediately following, he was living at Thessalonica. But what is alleged to the
contrary from the celebration of the tenth year of Theodosius, which commenced in the
year 388, amounts, as I said, to nothing; since it is evident from the Fasti of Idatius and of
Marcellinus, that he anticipated by one year the celebration of the tenth year of his reign,
in order that he might celebrate his tenth together with his son Arcadius, who entered upon
the fifth year of his reign in 387; just in the same manner as Maximianus Herculius did,
when he celebrated the twentieth, though it was only the eighteenth, year of his reign, along
with Diocletion, whose twentieth year of empire it was.974</p>
<note type="footnote">972 i. e., so far as the inference is concerned. His testimony is explicit to the fact that the tax was levied for
that purpose, and he was on the spot.</note>

<pb n="442"/>
<p>4. But another and not a less difficulty arises, which has been already treated of in the
Preface to the work, “Against the Jews;” viz. that in a certain discourse against the Jews, held
in the month of September of the year 386, Chrysostom in reproving many of the Christians
at Antioch who fasted and kept Easter975 with the Jews, or at the same time observed by the
Jews, “Behold,” saith he, “the first day of unleavened bread in this year falls on Sunday, and
it is necessary that we should fast throughout the whole week, and after the Passion is past,
and the Cross and the Resurrection arrived,976 we should continue fasting; and very often
the same thing occurs, that after the Passion has passed away, and the Cross and the Resurrection
arrived, we are still keeping the fast, the week being not yet finished.” From these
words it is further evident, that those Christians, who acted as Jews in keeping the fast and
celebrating the Passover, must sometimes have fasted when other Christians were celebrating
the Paschal feast, and at other times not so; for example, they fasted on the day of the Resurrection
when the Jews celebrated the feast of the Passover later than the rest of the Christians
did, but they did not fast when the Jews celebrated the same feast earlier than the Christians.
But in the discourse of Chrysostom above mentioned, and held about the month of
September of the year 386, he is doubtless treating of Lent and Easter of the year 387. But
in that year, according to the Paschal tables, the feast fell on the 25th of April, that is to say,
as late as it can possibly occur. How then could these judaizing Christians be fasting this
year during the Paschal feast, and celebrate that feast too late, when this could not occur
later than on the 25th of April, on which day the other nonjudaizing Christians celebrated
it this year, at least if the Paschal tables are to be relied upon? This is certainly a very great
difficulty; but one which, as Tillemont himself confesses, is not sufficient to overturn the
marks of the period by which we assign the Homily, “Against the Jews,” to the month of
September, in the year 386. For as we have said in the Preface to the Homilies against the
Jews, it has not yet been made out to us so certainly, whether the people of Antioch always
followed by an invariable rule the Alexandrian reckoning as to the Feast of the Lord’s Pas-
<note type="footnote">975 Pascha is either Passover or Easter. St. Thos. Aquinas, in the Hymn Lauda Sion, appropriates it to the
Christian Festival, calling the Jewish Phase vetus.</note>
<note type="footnote">976 i. e., the actual days of them on the Jewish computation. This appears the true answer to the difficulty.
The Jews kept the Passover this year earlier than the Christians: viz. on the 14th day of the moon, or April 18.
See l’Art de Verifier les Dates on the year. Thus the supposed difficulty becomes a confirmation of the date otherwise
determined. Montfaucon understood it, “we must…if we follow the Judaizers.” Tillemont is at a loss to
explain the title of Homily III. against the Jews. Against those who would fast the first Passover. It may mean
either the original, or that which then happened to be the earlier. The word fast is explained by taking it as their
expression for keep. He thinks it necessary to tell them that the true Passover is not fasting, but the Holy Communion.
Ben. t. i. p. 611, b. And this agrees with what he says is the common case, viz. that the Christian Easter
is so much later, as is required to complete the week.</note>

<pb n="443"/>
sover, and if they had always followed it, can we affirm that they never fell into error in their
reckoning? Certainly the persons best skilled in the Paschal reckonings, whom I have consulted,
have admitted that an error of this sort sometimes does happen in such reckonings,
and did happen not many years since; and that it is not always safe to prefer the Paschal
indications to any other notes of time.</p>
<p>5. Tillemont, however, who notices this kind of difficulty, and discusses it in his notes
to the Life of Chrysostom, where he treats of the Homilies against the Jews, has not mentioned
it in the notes to the Life of the Emperor Theodosius, where he arranges these Homilies of
Chrysostom to the people of Antioch as if the Feast of Easter had fallen on the 25th of April,
as the Paschal tables have it. The first Homily therefore he places a little before the sedition;
but the sedition on the 26th of February, ten days before Lent, which at Antioch began on
the Monday of our Quinquagesima, falling that year on the 8th of March. The second Homily
either on the Thursday, or the Saturday before Lent; viz. on the 6th of March, the eighth
day after the sedition. The third on the following Sunday, the 7th of March, or thereabout.
The fourth, on the Monday following, March 8. The fifth, on Tuesday, March 9. The sixth,
about the next Wednesday, on March 10. The seventh, on Thursday, March 11. The eighth,
on Friday, March 12. The ninth on the Monday of the second week in Lent, March 15. The
tenth, after the lapse of a few days. The eleventh, (considering it transposed,) on the Monday
of the fourth week in Lent, March 29. The twelfth, on the following Tuesday, March 30. The
thirteenth, on the following Wednesday, March 31. The fourteenth, a little after that one
which is numbered the eighteenth, which was delivered on the fifth Sunday in Lent, April
5. The fifteenth, on the Saturday of the second week in Lent, or March 20. The sixteenth,
on the third Saturday in Lent, March 21. The seventeenth, about the end of the fourth week
in Lent. The eighteenth, Sunday, April 5, or thereabout. The nineteenth, after the fourteenth,
about April 11. The twentieth, on Easter Day, April 25. The twenty-first, about the same
time as the twenty-second following it, which was delivered on the Friday after Passion
Sunday, April 16.977 Thus does Tillemont endeavour to restore with the utmost accuracy
the deranged order of these Homilies. Whilst however we agree with him in many things,
we are compelled to differ from him in others. The order of the Homilies, as he lays it down,
we may here further represent in one tabular view.</p>

<p>But before we discourse singly of the Homilies, and make a few observations as to the
order as well as the argument of each, it may be worth while to remark, that from the title
of the Homily which formerly was numbered the twenty-second, but not the twentieth,
which title it has in the notes of Fronton, and in our mss.; it must have been spoken ten days
before Easter; and that from these words likewise, just before the end of the Homily, “Forty
days have already passed away,” Tillemont justly infers, that Lent among the people of Antioch
began on the Monday after Quinquagesima; and that among them the whole Lent
extended through seven weeks; and he rightly assigns this Homily to a Friday during Lent;978
so that that day was both the fortieth from the beginning of the fast, and the tenth before
Easter. Hence we hold it as a thing established, that Lent, which in divers Churches was
defined by various limits, was observed at Antioch during seven979 weeks.</p>
<p>Moreover, since for the causes before related, we may account the diurnal Paschal tables,
which place the Easter of the year 387 upon the 25th of April, as of doubtful authority,980
at least those for the use of the Church at Antioch; we have not discovered with certainty
on what day the people of Antioch kept Easter in this year 387, we shall abstain from men-
<note type="footnote">978 “Feriam sextam Quadragesima.” This looks like a reprint, as he is more definite.</note>
<note type="footnote">979 As now in the Greek church. The Latins do not count the week in which Ash-Wednesday is, as not being

<note type="footnote">980 It has been shewn, in a former note, that there is no reason for this doubt.</note>

<pb n="445"/>
tioning the day of the month in the review of the Homilies, and we shall account it sufficient
to have indicated, when that may be safely done, on what day of the week the Homilies were
spoken.</p>
<p>The first Homily, then, was delivered a few days before the sedition at Antioch, as is
discoverable from these words in No. (3) of the second Homily; “I lately protracted a long
discourse to your charity and I have received981 reward for my labours. But what was the
reward? To punish the blasphemers in the city, and to chastise those who treat God with
contempt, and to restrain the violent.” Without doubt these words have reference to the
first Homily, one of great length, on the subject of the sorrows of the Saints, and the
providence of God towards His Elect, who are tormented in this life, where at last he thus
expresses himself in a manner certainly worthy of observation. “But since our discourse has
now turned to the subject of blasphemy, I desire to ask one favour of you all in return for
this address and speaking with you, which is, that you will correct on my behalf those who
blaspheme in this city. And should you hear any one in the public thoroughfare, or in the
midst of the forum, blaspheming God; go up to him, rebuke him; and should it be necessary
to inflict blows, spare not to do so. Smite him on the face; strike his mouth; sanctify thy
hand with the blow.” Which truly would be a mode of correction not suited to modern usage.</p>
<p>The second Homily, Tillemont refers either to the Thursday or to the Saturday before
Lent; but it may more safely be pronounced to have been spoken “about” that time, seven
days having been completed as Chrysostom himself says, since the sedition, during which
he declares that he had been silent, because the people of Antioch, being in consternation
from the mighty calamity and from the immensity of the danger, were in no fit state for the
hearing of Sermons; moreover, that this evil was one sent from God, on account of their
having neglected the correction of their blaspheming brethren; and after he has drawn a
beautiful picture of their state, he concludes the discourse, after having preached at length
on riches, the use of riches, alms-giving, and poverty.</p>
<p>The third Homily follows close on the second. But we suppose with Tillemont, that it
was delivered on Quinquagesima Sunday (to speak according to modern custom). Chrysostom
treats here of the departure of Flavian the Bishop of Antioch to Constantinople for
the purpose of appeasing the Emperor, and consoles the people with the hope of his succeeding.
He then proves at length that there is no utility in fasting, unless there be an abstinence
from vices. But after making a few remarks on avoiding slander, he deplores the present
calamity, and relates some harsh severities. “Some,” saith he, “have perished by the sword,
some by fire; some given to wild beasts; and not men only but children. And neither this
immaturity of age, nor the tumult of the people, nor the circumstance that they were infuriated
by demons when they perpetrated such deeds, nor that the exaction was thought to be
<note type="footnote">981 “accepi,” it should be, as in Text, “exegi,” “I demanded.”</note>

<pb n="446"/>
intolerable, nor poverty, nor having offended in company with all, nor promising that they
would never hereafter dare to repeat such deeds, nor any thing else could at all rescue them;
but they were led away to the pit without reprieve, armed soldiers conducting and guarding
them on either side, lest any one should carry off the criminals; whilst mothers also followed
afar off, seeing their children beheaded, but not daring to bewail their calamity; for terror
conquered grief, and fear overcame nature.”</p>
<p>All these evils were inflicted on the people of Antioch by the Prefects or Magistrates
before Theodosius had heard any thing of the sedition, as Chrysostom says in the same
place. But he concludes the address by admonishing that they should abstain from slander,
from enmities, and from oaths.</p>
<p>The fourth Homily, delivered as it seems on the Monday, which was the beginning of
Lent, describes the advantages gained from the calamity. He speaks of the people of Antioch
as changed and brought back from their former habits. But at the close he again repeats the
same admonition, which he reminds them that he had given in the foregoing Homily, that
is to say, concerning slanders, enmities, and oaths. But in No. (6.), he says, that he should
speak throughout this week concerning oaths.</p>
<p>The fifth Homily was pronounced on the day following, that is, on the Tuesday, as
Chrysostom says at the beginning of it. In this Chrysostom consoles the people of Antioch
as usual, under their sadness, and exhorts them to a contempt for death. In the end also he
treats No. (7.) of the avoidance of oaths, and indicates somewhat of the order of the foregoing
and following Homilies in these words. “Let us therefore persuade it (our soul) to make this
first change for the better by the avoidance of oaths; for although I spake to you yesterday
and the day before982 on this same subject, yet neither to-day, nor to-morrow, nor the day
after, will I desist from giving my counsel on this subject.”</p>
<p>In the sixth Homily, delivered on the Wednesday of the first week, he imparts consolation
to the afflicted, and urges them to hope for a prosperous turn of affairs. He speaks of the
delays the messengers had met with, who were gone to announce to the Emperor the sedition
at Antioch, as proceeding from God; and from thence deduces a favourable hope for his
hearers, and bids them feel confidence of obtaining pardon by the petition of Flavian the
Bishop; and after he had discoursed on the subject of not being afraid of death, he again
speaks as usual against oaths.</p>
<p>The seventh Homily was delivered, as is evident from many indications, on the day
following. “It is the fifth day,” says Chrysostom, “we are engaged in speaking words of
comfort to your charity.” But this fifth day is reckoned by beginning from the Sunday, so
that he must be speaking of the fifth day of the week. He here treats of the first words of
Genesis, “In the beginning God made heaven and earth;” and he observes, that God is not
<note type="footnote">982 Lat. has only “the day before yesterday.”</note>

<pb n="447"/>
only good when He chastises, but also when He confers favours;983 and concludes by exhorting
to avoid oaths.</p>
<p>The eighth Homily Tillemont supposes to have been spoken on the day following the
seventh Homily, that is, on the Friday. But Chrysostom disclaims it, who testifies at the
outset that he discoursed on the passage, “In the beginning God made heaven and earth,
lately” (πρῴην) not yesterday (χθšς), which without doubt belongs to the seventh Homily.
Therefore the present Homily is to be assigned to the Saturday;984 which these words just
immediately after the beginning would also incline us to think. “The week hath nearly arrived
at its close with us.” The argument of the Homily he draws from these words, “God was
walking in Paradise in the cool of the day.” On this he observes the wicked are always timid
and fearful, but the godly full of confidence. Finally, he treats according to his custom of
the avoiding of oaths, and says, that it is now the sixth day since he had been admonishing
as to the observance of this law.</p>
<p>The ninth Homily Tillemont with probability allots to the Monday of the second week
in Lent. But as to this matter no indication presents itself by which we may lay down any
thing certain or probable. This discourse was, however, delivered after a silence of one or
more days, as Chrysostom expressly states985 at the beginning; contrary to which is the
opinion of Tillemont, who, whilst he allots the eighth Homily to the Friday of one week,
and the ninth to the Monday of the week following, says in the Life of Chrysostom, Art.
(15.), that the intervening Sabbaths and Lord’s days were doubtless distinguished by discourses
of Chrysostom, which discourses have been lost. Chrysostom, at the commencement
of this, praises the people of Antioch, that yielding to his admonitions they were taking
pains to expel the practice of oaths. On these words also, “The heavens declare the glory of
God,” he speaks at length, and sets forth God’s providence in the order and harmony of the
natural world, and at length he concludes the address by admonishing that oaths should be
abstained from.</p>
<p>The tenth Homily was not delivered on the day following the ninth, although it follows
up the same argument, as is shewn by the word, πρῴην “lately.” But Chrysostom here congratulates
his auditors that they had yielded to his admonitions. He declares it is far better
<note type="footnote">983 This must be a slip of the pen. [The sentences have clearly got transposed, and we should read “not only
good when He confers favours, but also when He chastises.”—Ed.]</note>
<note type="footnote">984 Both arguments may stand, as the common use of πρῴην is undoubted.</note>
<note type="footnote">985 By using the word πρῷην. But this may be in anticipation of his reference to Hom. VII. But if this Homily
were delivered on Monday, the first day of strict fasting, the scruples of the congregation would be accounted
for. No difficulty remains but the use of πρῷην, in Hom. X., against which is ἐπιοῦσαν. Placing the trials, and
Hom. XI.–XVIII. a week later throughout, seems less consistent.</note>

<pb n="448"/>
to hear the word of God than to fast. He then proves that the world could not possibly subsist
without a divine Providence, and he ends, at length, by an exhortation to abstain from oaths.</p>
<p>The eleventh Homily, Tillemont supposes to have been delivered after that which here
has the inscription of the fifteenth, as well as after the sixteenth which follows it. The argument
he employs is this; In this Homily he says, the subject is concerning certain dangers
and distresses which the city of Antioch had already passed through, which events seem to
have taken place after the arrival of Hellebichus and Cæsarius. But that arrival of Hellebichus
and Cæsarius is mentioned in the Title of the seventeenth Homily,986 long after the eleventh
of which we are now treating.</p>
<p>Supported by this argument, Tillemont thinks that not only the fifteenth, but also the
sixteenth ought to be placed before the eleventh. But besides that all the Manuscripts, without
exception, preserve the very same order as the published Editions, we have not a sufficiently
accurate knowledge of all the events, the dangers, terrors, and threats of the time, that for
a reason of this sort we should deem there ought to be any change in the order. Chrysostom
has spoken of many things, but was perhaps silent on many more. Wherefore, until something
more certain be brought to light, we think the ancient order must be adhered to. In this
Homily Chrysostom at the beginning gives thanks, because the city breathed again after the
terror that had fallen on it, since multitudes had taken flight in consequence of suspicions
that had been thrown out among them. For some days Chrysostom was silent (as he himself
says) during this season of calamity and terror. But Tillemont assigns this Homily to the
Monday of the fourth week in Lent, and indeed with the best reason, as we shall shew when
we come to the thirteenth Homily. In the present Homily he treats principally of the wisdom
of God in the constitution of man, and at the end concerning the avoiding of oaths.</p>
<p>The twelfth, as well as the thirteenth, for the same reason as above, Tillemont makes
later than the fifteenth and sixteenth. But I know not in what way he understands that passage
in this twelfth Homily, No. (2.) “On the three foregoing days, then, we have investigated
one method of acquiring the knowledge of God, and have brought it to a conclusion, explaining
how ‘the’ visible ‘heavens declare the glory of God,’ and what is the meaning of that
which is said by Paul; ‘The invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly
seen, being understood by the things that are made;’ and we have shewed how from the
creation of the world, and how by heaven, and earth, and sea, the Creator is glorified. But
to-day,” etc. Here Chrysostom clearly refers to a series of these Homilies in the order in
which they were delivered before the twelfth, that is to say, the ninth, the tenth, and the eleventh.
In the ninth (No. 2.) he places as the argument of his discourse the saying of Paul,
<note type="footnote">986 See note at the beginning of that Homily and the preceding; it is almost certain from the whole character
of Hom. XVII. that it was not delivered immediately after the events referred to. Probably many had returned,
who St. Chrysostom wished to inform of the events during their absence.</note>

<pb n="449"/>
“The invisible things of Him,” etc. as well as that of the Psalms, “The heavens declare the
glory of God.” In the tenth (No. 2.) likewise he declares that he is pursuing this very argument.
In the eleventh (No. 2.) also he testifies that he is insisting on the same argument. Is not
Tillemont doing violence to the words of Chrysostom, when he wishes the tenth and the
eleventh to be inserted between the fifteenth and sixteenth? This, however, he only proposes,
half doubtingly, in note (29) on the Emperor Theodosius, No. 10, 11 seqq. and he confesses,
that the order which we have laid down is clearly indicated by Chrysostom; but for what
reason I know not, he afterwards departs from the same order. But when Chrysostom says,
“on the three past days,” it is not to be understood of three successive days, but of the three
last days on which he had preached. In this twelfth Homily, likewise, which was delivered
on the Tuesday of the fourth week, he dwells on the same subject of the wisdom of God in
the creation of the world. He afterwards treats of the natural law, the knowledge of which
God hath implanted in man, and on the avoidance of oaths.</p>
<p>The thirteenth Homily was spoken the day after the twelfth. At the commencement he
returns thanks to God that the face of affairs was changed, and the fear removed, which had
been such that “the greater part of the city,” as he says, “had taken refuge from the fear and
danger of that occasion in secret places, in deserts, and hollows.” Hence he proceeds to speak
of many who were dragged to the tribunal; of the horrible inquisition that took place by
means of the scourge; of others who were hurried away to punishment; of a mother and
sister of a certain person, who, whilst he was undergoing his trial within, were rolling in the
dust at the vestibule. Chrysostom describes pathetically these events which had been transacted
a few days before, that is to say, before he delivered the eleventh discourse. But the
words which Chrysostom uses in the beginning, οἵαν τὴν παρελθοῢσαν εἴδομεν τετρ€δα
καὶ οἵαν τὴν παροῢσαν ὁρωμεν νῢν, Bernard Brixianus thus renders, “Quale præteritum
vidimus quatriduum et quale nunc videmus præsens:” I know not for what reason we have
left this untouched. For although τετρὰς is sometimes taken to signify the fourth day, yet
in ecclesiastical language, even from the time of Clemens Alexandrinus, τετρὰς is the fourth
day of the week, so that the Translation should be corrected, and should stand, “Qualem
feriam quartam præteritam vidimus,” etc. In which it is declared, that the Homily was delivered
on the fourth day of the week, and that indeed the fourth week in Lent, or perhaps
the third, according to another mode of reckoning; since for many ages downwards the
Greeks call that the first Sunday and week of the fast987 which we call the first of Lent. But
this is only a question as to a name. The Homily was however delivered on the fourth day
<note type="footnote">987 See Sir H. Nicolas, Chron. of History, p. 117. Gloss. of Dates, art. Hebdomadæ Græcæ, observes, that the
Greeks named the weeks as beginning on Monday, and taking in Sunday at the end. Still they count Monday
the second day, etc. Thus the first Sunday would be the same as with the Latins, but the first week earlier. It
seems probable that this was a week earlier than here stated, see Hom. XVIII.</note>

<pb n="450"/>
of the week, and from the series of the Homilies, as well as from the silence of Chrysostom,
there seems plainly to be an interval of some days between the tenth and eleventh Homilies.
In this Homily, moreover, after much premised on that calamity of Antioch, he comes down
to the former argument concerning man’s creation, and concludes his discourse by an exhortation
after his manner on avoiding oaths.</p>
<p>The fourteenth Tillemont thinks ought to be placed after the eighteenth; influenced by
this reason, that Chrysostom says at the beginning, “Not a little did the devil yesterday disturb
our city, but God hath also not a little comforted us again.” These words, he observes, denote
that the arrival of Hellebichus, and of news from Constantinople, had already occurred. But
these are mere conjectures spoken at random.988 How many suspicions and terrors think
you were cast abroad among the people of Antioch, whilst they hung in doubt, and were
ignorant to what result so unhappy an affair might lead? But how can we possibly argue
respecting these terrors and reports, when we are doubtless ignorant of the greater part of
them, and have so obscure a perception of what we do know, that we can scarcely gather
from thence any indication of the time? This Homily is almost wholly on the subject of
avoiding oaths.</p>
<p>The fifteenth Homily, Tillemont would have it, was delivered between the tenth and
eleventh, both for the reasons above mentioned, and because Chrysostom has these words
at the commencement, Εδει καὶ τήμερον καὶ τῳ προτ™ρῳ σαββ€τῳ τὸν περὶ νηστείας
κινησαι λόγον. “It had been right both to-day and on the former Sabbath, to let the discourse
turn on the subject of fasting.” Where he understands the expression, τῳ προτ™ρῳ, as though
it were τῳ πρώτῳ,—the first Saturday in Lent, entertaining however some doubts on the
point. But we, as well as Bernard Brixianus, understand it of the earlier or preceding one.989
And we have already proved in a former paragraph, that no other Homily can be placed
between the tenth and the eleventh. On the occasion of the dread with which the people of
Antioch990 were affected, he enlarges on the advantage of fear, and at the end he preaches
against the custom of swearing, and of requiring an oath from others.</p>
<p>The sixteenth Homily was delivered when all were deliberating upon making their escape
from the city, in consequence of a certain report, that a sack was to take place. Tillemont
endeavours also to change the position of this Homily, and to place it between the tenth
and eleventh, which, however, as we have said in our remarks upon the twelfth, it cannot
admit of. Tillemont further supports his argument by these words: in No. 6, the holy Doctor
says, “We have passed through the second week of the fast.” He infers, therefore, that two
<note type="footnote">988 And dependent on the erroneous notions, that Hom. XVII. was delivered immediately on the arrival of
the commissioners.</note>
<note type="footnote">989 It may be that, or the first in Lent, considered as the last on which he had preached.</note>
<note type="footnote">990 Πριντεδ, Χονσταντινοπλε.</note>

<pb n="451"/>
weeks only of the fast had passed away, and Tillemont on that ground determines, that it
ought to be moved out of its place. He supposes it was spoken on the third Sunday in Lent,
reckoning for the first Sunday that which preceded the first day of the fast, which we call
Quinquagesima Sunday. But what if at Antioch at that time, that was called the first Sunday
of Lent, which according to modern custom occurs as the first within the fast?991 For the
fast did begin the Monday after Quinquagesima, and now it begins on the Wednesday, and
the people of Antioch might not reckon that week for the first week of Lent, just as we do
not reckon it as so, and in that way this Homily would have been delivered one week later,
that is to say, taking the Sunday after the modern custom. But even then a great difficulty
would remain, for this Homily would precede the thirteenth and following ones. Certainly
all these points are full of perplexity, as Tillemont himself confesses, who is compelled to
leave the question, without entirely coming to any conclusion upon it. Perhaps familiarity,
and longer handling, will add to our knowledge on so obscure a subject, which it is possible
we may be able to determine, in drawing up the life of Chrysostom at the end of his works,992
more clearly and accurately. For which reason we have purposely determined to leave the
matter doubtful. That one point only we contend for, that this Homily cannot be placed
between the tenth and eleventh, for the reasons above mentioned. Certain things being
premised as to the timidity of the people of Antioch, and the avoiding of oaths, Chrysostom
borrows the argument of the Homily from those words of Paul, “Paul, a prisoner of Jesus
Christ, and Timothy our brother;” and shews that Paul was more glorious from bonds, than
from the power of miracles.</p>
<p>The seventeenth was delivered after Ellebichus, or Hellebichus, (styled Magister Militum),
and Cæsarius, (styled Magister), the persons sent by the Emperor for the purpose of instituting
an inquiry into the sedition, had arrived at Antioch. This Hellebichus, Master of the
Horse or993 Foot, is found mentioned elsewhere, and was distinguished by a reputation for
justice and clemency. Cæsarius, also styled elsewhere Master of the Offices, enjoyed a similar
reputation for high character. But this Homily was pronounced when the people of Antioch
were almost free from fear. “We expected,” says Chrysostom (No. 1.), “innumerable horrors,
that the property of all was to be plundered; the habitations consumed, together with their
inmates; the city snatched away from the midst of the world; and all its relics obliterated,
<note type="footnote">991 He may exclude the τυροφ€γος, or cheese-week, as not one of the strictest fasting. This appears to have
been the case from Homily XVIII., which cannot well be placed anywhere but on the fourth Sunday, and which
says that half the fast is over.</note>
<note type="footnote">992 This is chiefly a reprint of this preface. Here nothing better is suggested than the supposition of a mistake
in transcribing. The difficulty arises from the mistaken notion, that it was before the trials, whereas it was
probably delivered a little before the return of a messenger from Cæsarius. See Tabular View.</note>
<note type="footnote">993 Ιν τηε Λιφε “ανδ Φοοτ.”</note>

<pb n="452"/>
and its soil ploughed up: but, lo! all these things stood only in expectance, and came not
actually to pass.” Next he relates how the monks descended from the mountains to Antioch,
that they might appease the judges, while at the same time all the Greek philosophers
deserted the city; and in what way also the priests strenuously exerted themselves on behalf
of the people. He declares the penalties imposed by the Emperor to be light and easy, and
no matter of grief or complaint, though the orchestra and public bath were closed, and the
dignity of a metropolis taken away from the city of Antioch. The true dignity of Antioch
was, that the disciples of Christ were first called Christians there; that the people of Antioch
had brought assistance to the saints at Jerusalem, when struggling with famine; that not
magnitude, but piety, is the ornament of cities. Finally, however, he says that some were yet
remaining in prison; and that others were sent into exile. This Homily Tillemont assigns to
the fourth week of Lent, after Wednesday, but only from conjecture.994</p>
<p>The eighteenth Homily was spoken after half the fast was over, as Chrysostom himself
says at the beginning. But Tillemont thinks it may probably be assigned to the fifth Sunday
of Lent. He treats moreover of the true reason for fasting; of contempt for riches; of godly
sorrow, U+0026c. </p>
<p>The nineteenth Homily was delivered as the title has it, τῃ κυριακῃ της ἐπισωζομ™νης,
or as Fronto Ducæus reads it, της σωζομ™νμς. Among the Cappadocians, ἐπισωζομ™νη is
Ascension Day, as Allatius says in his book on the Sundays and Weeks of the Greeks, adding
that the Sunday thus called is the fifth after Easter,995 i.e. the one which precedes the Ascension
of our Lord. But Savile says that it is996 the first Sunday after Easter; from whence he
got his information I know not. Yet there seems no doubt that it was some one of the last
Sundays in Lent, or, as Tillemont supposes, Passion-Sunday, to which I rather incline.
Chrysostom, who had been detained at home for some time by sickness, after he has prefaced
his subject with some remarks on the Festival of the Martyrs, which had been just celebrated
at Antioch, and on the arrival of the rustics, speaks according to his custom against oaths,
and illustrates their pernicious effects by many examples.</p>
<p>Hitherto, in the number and order of the Homilies, we have followed the editions of
Savile and Fronto Ducæus. But henceforth it is otherwise; for that which follows as the
twentieth in former editions, is without doubt the twenty-first and last on the Statues. But
the twenty-first is a Catechesis, which we have placed second after another Catechesis, which
was inscribed as the first, as we remark in the Notice placed at the end of the Homilies on
<note type="footnote">994 The Life adds, The rank of metropolis was transferred from Antioch to Laodicea, according to Theordoret,
l. 5, c. 10.</note>
<note type="footnote">995 In the Life, and in Pref. to vol. 4, it is proved from Hom. I. de Annâ (1), that this Homily was actually
delivered on that day. This being so, Flavian would be the “Leader” of the Festival.</note>
<note type="footnote">996 Dominica in albis.</note>

<pb n="453"/>
the Statues, and in front of the Catechetical Lectures; since this Catechesis ought to be placed
entirely without the series of the Homilies on the Statues. But the Homily, which is in former
editions the twenty-second, is without doubt the twentieth, which was delivered ten days
before Easter. Therefore we proceed in this order.</p>
<p>The twentieth Homily has these words in the title, according to manuscripts mentioned
by Fronto Ducæus, and likewise in some of ours, and particularly that in the Royal Library,
numbered 1971. Ελ™χθη δš πρὸ δ™κα ἡμερων της ƒγίας καὶ ζωοποιου του Κυρίου ἡμων
'Ιησου Χριστου ἐκ νεκρων ‡ναστ€σεως. “It was spoken ten days before the holy and lifegiving
Resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ from the dead.” This therefore is in perfect
accordance with that saying of Chrysostom, a little before the end of the Homily, “Forty
days have passed away.” This sermon then was delivered on the Friday after the Sunday
which we call Passion-Sunday. For this day was the fortieth, beginning from the Monday
after Quinquagesima, which was the commencement of Lent. But it was likewise the tenth
before Easter, reckoning Easter itself with it. The Homily is almost throughout against
enmity and the remembrances of injuries, and at the close is, according to Chrysostom’s
accustomed manner, directed against oaths. The twenty-first Homily, which is the last on
the Statues, seems, from what he says just at the beginning, to have been delivered on the
very day of the Lord’s Resurrection, and after the return of Flavian the Bishop; whose journey
to the Emperor, and address to the same on behalf of the city’s preservation, as well as the
Emperor’s reply full of lenity in which he pardons the citizens, are all particularly related
by Chrysostom, occupying the whole of this discourse. But even until the return of Flavian,
the people of Antioch were terrified by every day’s reports, and fluctuated between hope
and fear, as Chrysostom observes a little after the beginning.</p>

<head>HOMILIES OF ST. JOHN CHRYSOSTOM,
ARCHBISHOP OF CONSTANTINOPLE,
ADDRESSED TO THE PEOPLE OF ANTIOCH,
CONCERNING THE STATUES.</head>

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="1">
<head>Homily I.</head>
<p>The Argument.</p>
<p>This Homily was delivered in the Old Church997 of Antioch, while St. Chrysostom was yet a
Presbyter, upon that saying of the Apostle, 1 Tim. v. 23, “Drink a little wine for thy
stomach’s sake, and thy often infirmities.”</p>
<p>1. Ye have heard the Apostolic voice, that trumpet from heaven, that spiritual lyre! For
even as a trumpet sounding a fearful and warlike note, it both dismays the enemy, and
arouses the dejected spirits on its own side, and filling them with great boldness, renders
those who attend to it invincible against the devil! And again, as a lyre, that gently soothes
with soul-captivating melody, it puts to slumber the disquietudes of perverse thoughts; and
thus, with pleasure, instills into us much profit. Ye have heard then to-day the Apostle discoursing
to Timothy of divers necessary matters! for he wrote to him as to the laying on of
hands, saying, “Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins.”998
And he explained the grievous danger of such a transgression, by showing that so men will
undergo the punishment of the sins perpetrated by others, in common with them, because
they confer the power on their wickedness by the laying on of hands. Presently again he
says, “Use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake, and thine often infirmities.” To-day also he
<note type="footnote">997 So called, because situated in the more ancient part of the city of Antioch, near the river Orontes. It was
also called the Apostolic Church, as being that founded by the Apostles. This Homily was spoken a little before
the breaking out of the sedition. It has, however, always been classed with the rest because alluded to in the next
Homily.</note>
<note type="footnote">998 1 Tim. v. 22.</note>

<pb n="456"/>
has discoursed to us concerning the subjection of servants, and the madness of misers, as
well as on the arrogance of the rich, and on various other matters.</p>
<p>2. Since then it is impossible to go through every part, what part of the words rehearsed
would you have us select for the subject of our address to your charity?999 For as in a
meadow, I perceive in what has been read a great diversity of flowers; a multiplicity of roses
and violets, and of lilies not a few; and everywhere the various and copious fruit of the
Spirit is scattered around, as well as an abundant fragrance. Yea, rather the reading of the
divine Scriptures is not a meadow only, but a paradise; for the flowers here have not a mere
fragrance only, but fruit too, capable of nourishing the soul. What part then of the things
rehearsed do you desire that we bring before you this day? Do you wish what seems the
more insignificant, and easy for any one to understand, to be that which we should handle
at present? To me, indeed, this seems proper, and I doubt not you will concur in this opinion.
What then is this that might seem plainer than anything else? What but that, which seems
so easy, and obvious for any one to say? Well! what is that? “Use a little wine for thy stomach’s
sake, and thine often infirmities.” Well then, let us employ the whole of our discourse upon
this subject; and this we would do, not for the love of praise, nor because we study to exhibit
powers of oratory (for the things about to be spoken are not our own, but such as the grace
of the Holy Spirit may inspire); but in order that we may stir up those hearers who are too
listless, and may convince them of the greatness of the treasure of the holy Scriptures; and
that it is neither safe, nor free from peril, to run through them hastily. For if indeed a text
so simple and obvious as this one, which seems to the multitude to contain nothing that
need be insisted on, should appear to afford us the means of abundant riches, and openings
toward the highest wisdom, much rather will those others, which at once manifest their
native wealth, satisfy those who attend to them with their infinite treasures. Assuredly then,
we ought not hastily to pass by even those sentences of Scripture which are thought to be
plain; for these also have proceeded from the grace of the Spirit; but this grace is never small,
nor mean, but great and admirable, and worthy the munificence of the Giver.</p>
<p>3. Let us not therefore listen carelessly; since even they who roast the metallic earth,
when they have thrown it into the furnace, not only take up the masses of gold, but also
collect the small particles with the utmost care. Inasmuch, then, as we likewise have to
roast1000 the gold drawn from the Apostolic mines, not by casting it into the furnace, but
<note type="footnote">999 Gr., “unto your love,” a title by which St. Chrysostom addresses his hearers as we say, “Your Grace,”
“Your Majesty.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1000 The operation of roasting the ore, in the Cornish mines, consists in placing it in a comminuted state in
a furnace of a particular construction, where it is subjected to a strong heat, but not so strong as to smelt it; by
which the arsenic, sulphur, and other impurities, are carried off in the form of vapor, leaving the heavier
metallic substance behind.—Tr.</note>

<pb n="457"/>
by depositing it in the thoughts of your souls; not lighting an earthly flame, but kindling
the fire of the Spirit, let us collect the little particles with diligence.1001 For if the saying be
brief, yet is its virtue great. For pearls too have their proper market, not owing to the size
of the substance, but the beauty of their nature. Even so is it with the reading of the divine
Scriptures; for worldly instruction rolls forth its trifles in abundance, and deluges its hearers
with a torrent of vain babblings, but dismisses them empty-handed, and without having
gathered any profit great or small. Not so however is it with the grace of the Spirit, but, on
the contrary, by means of small sentences, it implants divine wisdom in all who give heed,
and one sentence often times affords to those who receive it a sufficient source of provision
for the whole journey of life.1002</p>
<p>4. Since then its riches are so great, let us arouse ourselves, and receive that which is
spoken with a watchful mind; for I am preparing to plunge our discussion to an extreme
depth. The admonition itself hath no doubt seemed beside the purpose, and superfluous to
many: and they are apt to talk much in this way, “Was Timothy of himself not able to judge
what it was needful to make use of, and did he wait to learn this of his teacher.1003 And then
did the teacher not only give directions, but also set them down in writing, graving it there
as on a column of brass in his Epistle to him? and was he not ashamed to give directions
about things of this nature, when writing in a public manner, to his disciple?” For this end
then, that thou mayest learn that the admonition, so far from being beside the purpose, was
a necessary and highly profitable one; and that the thing proceeded not from Paul, but from
the grace of the Spirit, viz, that this should have been (I say) not a spoken precept, but one
deposited in letters, and to be handed down to all future generations through the Epistle, I
shall proceed at once to the proof.</p>
<p>5. For besides the subjects which have been mentioned, there is another, about which
some are no less perplexed, enquiring within themselves on what account God permitted
a man possessing such confidence towards Him,1004 whose bones and relics expelled
demons,1005 to fall into such a state of infirmity; for it is not merely that he was sick, but
constantly, and for a length of time; and by these recurring and prolonged infirmities he
was not permitted to have even a brief respite. “How does this appear,” it may be asked?
From the very words of Paul, for he does not say, on account of the “infirmity,” but on ac-

being constant, when he says “thine often infirmities.” Let those then attend to this, whoever
they are, who being given over to a lingering1006 sickness are querulous and dejected under
it.</p>
<p>6. But the subject of enquiry is not only, that being a holy man he was sick, and sick so
continually, but that he was at the same time entrusted with the public affairs of the world.
For if he had been one of those who have retreated to the tops of mountains; who have fixed
their cells in solitude, and who have chosen that life which is free from all business, the
matter now enquired into were no such difficulty; but that one thrust forward in the throng,
and in whose hands the care of so many Churches was placed, and who superintended whole
cities and nations; nay, the world at large,1007 with so much alacrity and diligence, should
be subjected to the straitening of infirmities! This it is which may most of all bewilder one
who does not duly consider it. Because, even if not for himself, yet for others at least, it was
necessary he should have health. “He was the best general,” says the objector. “The war was
waged by him, not only against the unbeliever, but against demons, and against the devil
himself. All the enemy contended with much vehemence, scattering the forces, and capturing
prisoners;1008 but this man was able to bring back myriads to the truth, and yet he was sick!
For if,” he says, “no other injury to the cause had come of this sickness, yet this alone was
sufficient to discourage and relax the faithful. If soldiers, when they see their general detained
in bed, become discouraged and slack for the fight, much rather was it probable that the
faithful should betray somewhat of human nature, when they saw that teacher, who had
wrought so many signs, in continual sickness and suffering of body.”</p>
<p>7. But this is not all. These sceptics propose yet a further enquiry, by asking for what
reason Timothy neither healed himself, nor was healed by his instructor, when he was reduced
to this state. Whilst the Apostles raised the dead, cast out devils, and conquered death with
abundant ease, they could not even restore the body of one sick man! Although with respect
to other bodies, both during their own lives and after death, they manifested such extraordinary
power, they did not restore a stomach that had lost its vigour! And what is more than
this, Paul is not ashamed, and does not blush, after the many and great signs which he had
displayed even by a simple word; yet, in writing to Timothy, to bid him take refuge in the
healing virtue of wine drinking. Not that to drink wine is shameful. God forbid! For such
precepts belong to heretics; but the matter of astonishment is, that he accounted it no disgrace
not to be able, without this kind of assistance, to set one member right when it was disordered.

Nevertheless, he was so far from being ashamed of this, that he has made it manifest to all
posterity.1009 You see then to what a depth we have brought down the subject, and how
that which seemed to be little, is full of innumerable questions. Well then, let us proceed to
the solution; for we have explored the question thus deep, in order that, having excited your
attention, we might lay up the explanation in a safe storehouse.</p>
<p>8. But before I proceed to solve these questions, permit me to say something of the virtue
of Timothy, and of the loving care of Paul. For what was ever more tender hearted than this
man, who being so far distant, and encircled with so many cares, exercised so much consideration
for the health of his disciple’s stomach, and wrote with exact attention about the
correction of his disorder? And what could equal the virtue of Timothy? He so despised
luxury, and derided the sumptuous table, as to fall into sickness from excessive austerity,
and intense fasting. For that he was not naturally so infirm a person, but had overthrown
the strength of his stomach by fasting and water drinking; you may hear Paul himself carefully
making this plain. For he does not simply say, “use a little wine;” but having said before,
“drink no longer water,” he then brings forward his counsel as to the drinking of wine. And
this expression “no longer” was a manifest proof, that till then he had drunk water, and on
that account was become infirm. Who then would not wonder at his divine wisdom and
strictness? He laid hold on the very heavens, and sprang to the highest point of virtue. And
his Teacher testifies this, when he thus speaks, “I have sent unto you Timothy, who is my
beloved and faithful son in the Lord;”1010 and when Paul calls him “a son,” and a “faithful
and beloved son,” these words are sufficient to show that he possessed every kind of virtue.
For the judgments of the saints are not given according to favour or enmity, but are free
from all prejudice. Timothy would not have been so enviable, if he had been Paul’s son
naturally, as he was now admirable, inasmuch as having no connection with him according
to the flesh, he introduced himself by the relationship of piety into the Apostle’s adoption;
preserving the marks of his spiritual wisdom1011 with exactness in all things. For even as a
young bullock1012 linked to a bull, so he drew the yoke along with him, to whatever part of
the world he went: and did not draw it the less on account of his youth, but his ready will
made him emulate the labours of his teacher. And of this, Paul himself was again a witness
when he said, “Let no man despise him, for he worketh the work of the Lord as I also do.”1013

See you how he bears witness, that the ardour of Timothy was the very counterpart of his
own?</p>
<p>9. Furthermore, in order that he might not be thought to have said these things out of
favour or kindness, he makes his hearers themselves to be witnesses of the virtue of his son,
when he says, “But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with a father, so he hath served
with me in the Gospel;”1014 that is, “ye have had experience of his virtue, and of his approved
soul.” At the same time, however, that he had reached to this height of good works, he did
not thereby grow confident; but was full of anxiety and fear, therefore also he fasted rigidly,
and was not affected as many are, who, when they have kept themselves to it but ten, or
perhaps twenty months,1015 straightway give up the matter altogether. He, I say, was in no
wise thus affected, nor did he say anything like this to himself. “What further need have I
of fasting? I have gotten the mastery of myself; I have overcome my lusts; I have mortified
my body; I have affrighted demons; I have driven away the devil; I have raised the dead; I
have cleansed lepers; I am become terrible to the adverse powers; what further need have I
of fasting, or to seek safety from that quarter?” Anything like this he did not say, he did not
think of; but, in proportion as he abounded with innumerable good works, so much the
more did he fear and tremble.1016 And he learnt this spiritual wisdom from his preceptor;
for even he, after he had been rapt into the third heaven, and transported to paradise; and
had heard unutterable words; and taken part in such mysteries; and traversed the whole
world, like some winged being, when he wrote to the Corinthians, said, I fear “lest by any
means having preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.”1017 And if Paul was afraid
after so many signal good works; he who was able to say, “The world is crucified unto me,
and I unto the world;”1018 much more does it become us to fear; and the rather in proportion
as we have stored up1019 numerous good works. For then the devil becomes fiercer; then
he is more savage, when he beholds us regulating our lives with carefulness! When he sees
the cargo of virtue stowed together, and the lading become heavy, then he is in haste to accomplish
a more grievous shipwreck! For the insignificant and abject man, although he may

be supplanted and fall, brings not so great an injury to the common cause. But the man who
has been standing most conspicuously as it were on some eminence of virtue, and who is
one manifestly seen and known of all men, and admired of all; when he is assaulted and
falls, causes great ruin and loss. Not only because he falls from this elevation but makes
many of those who look up to him more negligent. And as it is in the body, some other limb
may be destroyed without there being any great damage, but if the eyes be deprived of sight,
or the head be seriously injured, the whole body is rendered useless; so also we must say of
the saints, and of those who have performed the highest good works; when such are extinguished,
when they contract any stain, they bring upon all the rest of the body a universal
and intolerable injury!</p>
<p>10. Timothy then, being aware of all these things, fortified himself on every side; for he
knew that youth is an age of difficulty; that it is unstable; easily deceived; very apt to slip;
and requires an exceedingly strong bridle. It is indeed a sort of combustible pile easily
catching anything from without, and quickly kindled; and for that reason he took care to
smother it on all sides; and strove to abate the flame in every way. The steed1020 that was
unmanageable and restive he curbed with much vehemence, until he had tamed him of his
wanton tricks; until he had made him docile; and delivered him under entire control, into
the hands of that reason which is the charioteer.1021 “Let the body,” saith he, “be infirm;
but let not the soul be infirm; let the flesh be bridled; but let not the race of the spirit towards
heaven be checked.” But moreover, one might especially wonder at the man for this, that
being thus diseased, and struggling with such an infirmity, he did not become indifferent
to God’s business, but flew everywhere faster than those who have sound and vigourous
constitutions; now to Ephesus; now to Corinth; often to Macedonia and Italy; appearing
everywhere, by land and by sea, with the Teacher, sharing in everything his struggles and
continuous dangers; while the spiritual wisdom of his soul was not put to shame by his
bodily infirmity. Such a thing is zeal for God! such lightness of wing does it impart! For as
with those who possess well-regulated and sound constitutions, strength is of no avail, if
the soul is abject, slothful, and stupid; so with those who are reduced to extreme weakness,
no hurt arises from their infirmity, if the soul be noble and well awake.</p>
<p>11. The admonition however, and the counsel, such as it is, appears to some to give
authority for drinking wine too freely. But this is not so. If indeed we closely investigate this
very saying, it rather amounts to a recommendation of abstinence. For just consider that
Paul did not at first, nor at the outset give this counsel. But when he saw that all strength

<note type="footnote">1021 Or “which guided himself.” A less easy construction, but better suited to the context. Compare Plato’s
famous illustration (probably known to St. Chrysostom), Phædrus, 246, in which Reason is represented as a

<pb n="462"/>
was overthrown, then he gave it; and even then not simply, but with a certain prior limitation.
He does not say merely, “Use wine,” but “a little” wine; not because Timothy needed this
admonition and advice, but because we need it. On this account, in writing to him, he prescribes
the measure and limit of wine-drinking for us; bidding him drink just so much as
would correct disorder; as would bring health to the body, but not another disease. For the
immoderate drinking of wine produces not fewer diseases of body and of soul, than much
drinking of water, but many more, and more severe; bringing in as it does upon the mind
the war of the passions, and a tempest of perverse thoughts, besides reducing the firmness
of the body to a relaxed and flaccid condition. For the nature of land that is long disturbed
by a superabundance of water, is not thereby so much dissolved, as the force of the human
frame is enfeebled, relaxed, and reduced to a state of exhaustion, by the continual swilling
of wine. Let us guard then against a want of moderation on either side, and let us take care
of the health of the body, at the same time that we prune away its luxurious propensities.
For wine was given us of God, not that we might be drunken, but that we might be sober;
that we might be glad, not that we get ourselves pain. “Wine,” it says, “maketh glad the heart
of man,”1022 but thou makest it matter for sadness; since those who are inebriated are sullen
beyond measure, and great darkness over-spreads their thoughts. It is the best medicine,
when it has the best moderation to direct it. The passage before us is useful also against
heretics, who speak evil of God’s creatures; for if it had been among the number of things
forbidden, Paul would not have permitted it, nor would have said it was to be used. And
not only against the heretics, but against the simple ones among our brethren, who when
they see any persons disgracing themselves from drunkenness, instead of reproving such,
blame the fruit given them by God, and say, “Let there be no wine.” We should say then in
answer to such, “Let there be no drunkenness; for wine is the work of God, but drunkenness
is the work of the devil. Wine maketh not drunkenness; but intemperance produceth it. Do
not accuse that which is the workmanship of God, but accuse the madness of a fellow mortal.
But thou, while omitting to reprove and correct the sinner, treatest thy Benefactor with
contempt!”</p>
<p>12. When, therefore, we hear men saying such things, we should stop their mouths; for
it is not the use of wine, but the want of moderation which produces drunkenness, Drunkenness!
that root of all evils. Wine was given to restore the body’s weakness, not to overturn
the soul’s strength; to remove the sickness of the flesh, not to destroy the health of the spirit.
Do not then, by using the gift of God immoderately, afford a handle to the foolish and the
impudent. For what is a more wretched thing than drunkenness! The drunken man is a
living corpse. Drunkenness is a demon self-chosen, a disease without excuse, an overthrow
that admits of no apology; a common shame to our kind. The drunken man is not only
<note type="footnote">1022 Ps. ciii. 15.</note>

<pb n="463"/>
useless in our assemblies; not only in public and private affairs; but the bare sight of him is
the most disgusting of all things, his breath being stench. The belchings, and gapings, and
speech of the intoxicated, are at once unpleasant and offensive, and are utterly abhorrent
to those who see and converse with them; and the crown of these evils is, that this disease
makes heaven inaccessible to drunkards, and does not suffer them to win eternal blessedness:
for besides the shame attending those who labour under this disease here, a grievous punishment
is also awaiting them there! Let us cut off then this evil habit, and let us hear Paul
saying, “Use a little wine.” For even this little he permits him on account of his infirmity;
so that if infirmity had not troubled him, he would not have forced his disciple to allow
himself even a small quantity, since it is fitting that we should always mete out even the
needful meat and drink, which are given us, by occasions and necessities; and by no means
go beyond our need, nor do anything unmeaningly and to no purpose.</p>
<p>13. But since we have now learnt the tender care of Paul, and the virtue of Timothy,
come and let us, in the next place, turn our discourse to the actual solution of those questions.
What then are the questions? For it is necessary again to mention them, that the solution
of them may be plainer. For what reason then did God permit that such a saint, and one
entrusted with the management of so many matters, should fall into a state of disease; and
that neither Timothy himself nor his teacher had strength to correct the disorder, but needed
that assistance which was to be had by drinking wine? Such, indeed, were the questions
proposed. But it is needful to bring forward a precise solution; so that if any should fall not
only into the like sickness and disease, but into poverty, and hunger, and bonds, and torments,
and discomfitures, and calumnies, and into all those evils which belong to the present
life, although they were great and wonderful saints, you may still be able to find, even for
their case, in the things which are to-day to be advanced, an exact and very clear reply to
those who are disposed to find fault. For ye have heard many asking such questions, as,
“Why ever is it that such an one, a moderate and meek man, comes to be dragged daily before
the seat of judgment by another who is lawless and wicked, and to suffer evils without
number, and God permits this? For what reason again was another man, upon false accusation,
unjustly put to death?” “Such a man,” says the objector, “was drowned; another was
thrown down a precipice; and we might speak of many saints, as well in our own days as in
the days of our forefathers, who have suffered divers and chequered tribulations.” To the
end, therefore, that we may see the reason of these things, and that we ourselves may not
be disturbed, nor overlook the case of others who thus meet with a stumbling-block, we
should attend with earnest heed to the reasons now about to be advanced.</p>
<p>14. For of the diversified and manifold affliction which befalls the saints, I have reasons
eight in number to declare unto your love. Therefore let all direct themselves to me with
the strictest attention, knowing that there will be no pardon nor excuse left us hereafter for

<pb n="464"/>
stumbling at the things which happen, if after all, when there are so many reasons, we are
just as much perplexed and disturbed as if there were not one to be found.</p>
<p>The first reason then is, that God permits them to suffer evil, that they may not too
easily be exalted into presumption, by the greatness of their good works and miracles.</p>
<p>The second, that others may not have a greater opinion of them than belongs to human
nature, and take them to be gods and not men.</p>
<p>The third, that the power of God may be made manifest, in prevailing, and overcoming,
and advancing the word preached, through the efficacy of men who are infirm and in bonds.</p>
<p>The fourth, that the endurance of these themselves may become more striking, serving
God, as they do, not for a reward; but showing even such right-mindedness as to give proof
of their undiminished good will towards Him after so many evils.</p>
<p>The fifth, that our minds may be wise concerning the doctrine of a resurrection. For
when thou seest a just man, and one abounding in virtue, suffering ten thousand evils, and
thus departing the present life, thou art altogether compelled, though unwillingly, to think
somewhat of the future judgment; for if men do not suffer those who have laboured for
themselves, to depart without wages and recompense; much more cannot God design, that
those who have so greatly laboured should be sent away uncrowned. But if He cannot intend
to deprive those of the recompense of their labours eventually, there must needs be a time,
after the end of the life here, in which they will receive the recompense of their present labours.</p>
<p>The sixth, that all who fall into adversity may have a sufficient consolation and alleviation,
by looking at such persons, and remembering what sufferings have befallen them.</p>
<p>The seventh, that when we exhort you to the virtue of such persons, and we say to every
one of you, “Imitate Paul, emulate Peter,” ye may not, on account of the surpassing character
of their good works, slothfully shrink from such an imitation of them, as deeming them to
have been partakers of a different nature.</p>
<p>The eighth, that when it is necessary to call any blessed, or the reverse, we may learn
whom we ought to account happy, and whom unhappy and wretched.</p>
<p>These then are the reasons; but it is necessary to establish them all from the Scriptures,
and to show with exactness that all that has been said on this subject is not an invention of
human reasoning, but the very sentence of the Scriptures. For thus will what we say be at
once more deserving of credit, and sink the deeper into your minds.</p>
<p>15. That tribulation then is profitable to the saints, that they may exercise moderation
and lowliness, and that they may not be puffed up by their miracles and good works, and
that God permits it for this end; we may hear David the prophet, and Paul saying the same.
The former says, “It is good for me, Lord, that I have been in trouble, that I might learn thy
statutes:”1023 and the latter having said, “I was caught up into the third heaven, and” trans-
<note type="footnote">1023 Ps. cxix. 71.</note>

<pb n="465"/>
ported to Paradise, goes on to say, “And lest I should be exalted above measure through the
abundance of the revelations, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan
to buffet me.”1024 What can be clearer than this? “That I might not be exalted above measure,”
for this reason, saith he, God permitted “the messengers of Satan to buffet me;” by messengers
of Satan, indeed, he means not particular demons, but men1025 ministering for the devil,
the unbelievers, the tyrants, the heathens, who perseveringly molested, and unceasingly
worried him. And what he says is just this: “God was able to repress these persecutions and
successive tribulations; but since I had been caught up into the third heaven, and transported
to Paradise, lest through the abundance of these revelations I might be lifted up and think
much of myself, he permitted these persecutions, and suffered these messengers of Satan to
buffet me with persecutions and afflictions, that I might not be too much exalted.” For although
Paul and Peter, and all that are like them, be holy and wonderful men, as indeed
they are, yet they are but men, and require much caution lest they should be too easily exalted;
and as saints more than others. For nothing is so apt to exalt to presumption as a conscience
full of good works, and a soul that lives in confidence. To the end, therefore, that these might
suffer nothing of this kind, God permitted that there should be temptations and tribulations;
these being powerful to keep them down, and to persuade to the exercise of moderation in
all things.</p>
<p>16. That this very particular also contributes much to the showing forth of God’s power,
you may learn even from the same Apostle, who told us the former. In order that you may
not say, (what indeed unbelievers think), that God in permitting this, is some infirm being,
and suffers such persons to be continually afflicted, from not being able to deliver His own
from dangers: this very thing, I say, observe how Paul has demonstrated by means of these
events, showing not only that the events were far from accusing Him of weakness, but that
they proved His power more strikingly to all. For having said, “There was given me a thorn
in the flesh; a messenger of Satan to buffet me,” and having thus signified his repeated trials,
he goes on to add, “For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me;
and He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is perfected in weakness.”
1026 “My power,” He means, “is seen then when ye are in weakness; and yet through
you, who seem to grow weak, the word preached is magnified, and is sown in all quarters.”
When therefore he was led to the dungeon, after having received a great number of stripes,
he took prisoner the keeper of the prison.1027 His feet were in the stocks, and his hands in
<note type="footnote">1024 2 Cor. xii. 2, 4, 7.</note>
<note type="footnote">1025 So he explains it also on the passage, on 2 Cor., Hom. XXVI. See also on Rom. viii. 6, Trans. p. 251, and
Bp. Bull, Serm v.</note>

<note type="footnote">1027 Acts xvi. 24.</note>

<pb n="466"/>
the chain; and the prison shook at midnight while they were singing hymns. See you, how
His power was perfected in weakness? If Paul had been at large, and had shaken that building,
the thing would not have been so wonderful. “For this reason,” He saith, “remain bound;
and the walls shall be shaken on every side, and the prisoners shall be loosed; in order that
My power may appear the greater, when through thee, confined and in fetters, all that are
in bonds shall be loosed.” This very circumstance then it was which at the time astounded
the keeper of the prison, that being so forcibly confined, he, through prayer alone, prevailed
to shake the foundations, and throw open the doors of the prison, and to unbind all the
prisoners. Nor is this the only occasion. But with Peter too, and Paul himself, as well as the
other disciples, one may see this occurring constantly; and in the midst of persecution, the
grace of God ever flourishing, and appearing by the side of the tribulations, and thus proclaiming
His power. Wherefore He saith, “My grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength
is perfected in weakness.”</p>
<p>17. But to show that many would be too often ready to imagine things of them above
human nature, unless they saw them enduring such afflictions, hear how Paul was afraid
on this very point; “For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool, but now I forbear,
lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of
me.”1028 But what is it that he means? I am able, he declares, to speak of far greater miracles;
but I am unwilling; lest the magnitude of the miracles should raise too high a notion of me
among men. For this reason Peter also, when they1029 had restored the lame man, and all
were wondering at them, in order to restrain the people, and persuade them that they had
exhibited nothing of this power of themselves, or from their native strength, says, “Why
look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man
to walk?”1030 And again at Lystra, the people were not only filled with astonishment, but
led forth bulls, after crowning them with garlands, and were preparing to offer sacrifice to
Paul and Barnabas. Observe the malice of the Devil. By those very same persons through
whom the Lord was at work, to purge out ungodliness from the world, by the same did that
enemy try to introduce it, again persuading them to take men for gods; which was what he
had done in former times. And this is especially that which introduced the principle and
root of idolatry. For many after having had success in wars, and set up trophies, and built
cities, and done divers other benefits of this kind to the people of those times, came to be
esteemed gods by the multitude, and were honoured with temples, and altars; and the whole
catalogue of the Grecian gods is made up of such men. That this, therefore, may not be done
<note type="footnote">1028 2 Cor. xii. 6.</note>

<pb n="467"/>
towards the Saints,1031 God permitted them constantly to be banished,—to be scourged,—to
fall into diseases; that the abundance of bodily infirmity, and the multiplicity of those
temptations, might convince those who were then with them, both that they were men, who
wrought such wonders, and that they contributed nothing of their own power; but that it
was mere grace, that wrought through them all these miracles. For if they took men for gods,
who had done but mean and vile things, much rather would they have thought these to be
such, had they suffered nothing proper to humanity, when they performed miracles, such
as no one had ever before seen or heard of. For if when they were scourged, thrown down
precipices, imprisoned, banished, and placed in peril every day, there were, notwithstanding,
some who fell into this impious opinion, how much rather would they have been thus regarded,
had they endured nothing which belongs to human nature!</p>
<p>18. This then is the third cause of affliction; and the fourth is, that the saints might not
be supposed to serve God from a hope of present prosperity. For many of those who live in
debauchery, when blamed as they often are by many, and invited to the labours of virtue;
and when they hear the saints commended for their cheerfulness under great hardships,1032
attack their character on this ground; and not men only, but the devil himself hath taken
up this suspicion. For when Job was surrounded with great wealth, and enjoyed much opulence,
that wicked demon,1033 being reproached by God on his account, and having nothing
to say; when he could neither answer the accusations against himself, nor impugn the virtue
of this just man; took refuge at once in this defence, speaking thus, “Doth Job fear thee for
nought? Hast thou not made an hedge about him on all sides.”1034 “For reward then,” saith
he, “that man is virtuous, enjoying thereby so much opulence.” What then did God? Being
desirous to show, that it was not for reward that his saints serve Him, He stripped him of

all his opulence; gave him over to poverty; and permitted him to fall into grievous disease.
Afterwards reproving him,1035 that he had suspected thus without cause, He saith, “He yet
holdeth fast his integrity; to no purpose didst thou move me to destroy his substance.” For
it is a sufficient reward, and compensation to the saints, that they are serving God; since
this indeed to the lover is reward enough, to love the object of his love;1036 and he seeks
nothing besides, nor accounts anything greater than this. And if such be the case with regard
to a man, much more in relation to God; which therefore that God might demonstrate, He
gave more than the devil asked; for the latter said, “Put forth thine hand, and touch him;”1037
but God said not thus, but, “I deliver him unto thee.” For just as in the contests1038 of the
outer world, the combatants that are vigorous, and in high condition of body,1039 are not
so well discerned, when they are enwrapt all around with the garment soaked in oil; but
when casting this aside, they are brought forward unclothed into the arena; then above all
they strike the spectators on every side with astonishment at the proportion of their limbs,
there being no longer anything to conceal them; so also was it with Job. When he was enveloped
in all that wealth, it was not visible to the many, what a man he was. But when, like
the wrestler, that strips off his garment, he threw it aside, and came naked to the conflicts
of piety, thus unclothed, he astonished all who saw him;1040 so that the very theatre of angels
shouted at beholding his fortitude of soul, and applauded him as he won his crown! For, as
I have already observed, he was not so well seen of men, when clad in all that wealth, as
when, casting it away like a garment, he exhibited himself naked as it were in a theatre, in
the midst of the world, and all admired his vigor of soul, evidenced as this was not only by
his being stripped of all things, but by the conflict, and by his patience in respect of his infirmity.
And as I said before, God Himself did not smite him; in order that the devil might
not again say, “Thou hast spared him, and hast not inflicted so great a trial as was necessary:”
but he gave to the adversary the destruction of his cattle, and power over his flesh. “I am
sure,” saith He, “of this wrestler; therefore I do not forbid thee to impose on him whatever
struggles thou desirest.” But as those who are well skilled in the sports of the palæstra, and

have reason to rely on their art and bodily strength, often do not seize their antagonists
upright, nor take an equal advantage, but suffer them to take them by the middle,1041 that
they may make a more splendid conquest; so also God gave to the devil to take this saint by
the waist, that when he had overcome, after an attack so greatly to his disadvantage, and
stretched his adversary on the ground, his crown might be so much the more glorious!</p>
<p>19. It is tried gold! Try it as thou desirest; examine it as thou wishest, thou wilt not find
in it any dross. This shows us not only the fortitude of others, but also brings much farther1042
consolation; for what saith Christ, “Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute
you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding
glad, for great is your reward in heaven: for in like manner did their fathers unto the
prophets.”1043 Again, Paul writing to the Macedonians in his desire to console them, says,
“For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which are in Judea. For ye also
have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews.”1044 And
again, he consoles the Hebrews in like manner, reckoning up all the just who had lived1045
in furnaces; in pits; in deserts; in mountains; in caves; in hunger; and in poverty.1046 For
communion of suffering brings some consolation to the fallen.</p>
<p>20. But that this also introduces arguments for the resurrection, hear the same Paul
again, saying, “If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what shall
it profit me if the dead are not raised.”1047 And further, “If in this life only we have hope,
we are of all men the most miserable.”1048 We suffer, he tells us, innumerable evils during
the present life; if then there is no other life to be hoped for, what can be more wretched
than our condition? Hence it is evident that our affairs are not bounded within the limits
of this present state; and this becomes manifest from our trials. For God could never suffer
those who have endured so many and so great evils, and who have spent all the present life
in trials and dangers without number, to be without a recompense of far greater gifts; and
if he could not suffer this, it is certain that he has prepared another, a better and brighter
life, in which he will crown those who have wrestled in the cause of godliness, and proclaim

their praises in the presence of the whole world. So that when you see a just man straitened
and afflicted; and in sickness, and in poverty, as well as innumerable other woes, till he ends
this present life; say to thyself, that if there were no resurrection and judgment, God would
not have permitted one, who endured such great evils for His sake, to depart hence without
enjoying any good thing; from whence it is evident, that for such He has prepared another
life, and one which is sweeter and much more endurable. For if it were not so, then he would
not suffer many of the wicked to luxuriate through the present life; and many of the just to
remain in ten thousand ills: but since there is provided another life, in which he is about to
recompense every man according to his deserts; one for his wickedness, another for his
virtue; on that account he forbears, while he sees the former enduring evil, and the latter
living in luxury.</p>
<p>21. And that other1049 reason too I will endeavor to bring forward from the Scriptures.
But what was it? It was, that we might not say, when exhorted to the same virtue, that they
were partakers of another nature, or were not men. On this account, a certain one speaking
of the great Elias, says, “Elias was a man of like passions with us.”1050 Do you perceive, that
he shows from a communion of suffering,1051 that he was the same kind of man that we
are? And again, “I too am a man of like passions with you.”1052 And this guarantees a
community of nature.</p>
<p>22. But that you may learn that this also teaches us to consider those blessed whom we
ought to consider blessed, is evident from hence. For when you hear Paul saying, “Even
unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffetted, and
have no certain dwelling place.”1053 And again; “Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and
scourgeth every son whom he receiveth;”1054 it is certain that it is not those who are enjoying
quietness, but those who are in affliction for God’s sake, and who are in tribulation, whom
we must applaud, emulating those who live virtuously, and cultivate piety. For so speaks
the prophet: “Their right hand is a right hand of iniquity. Their daughters beautified, ornamented
after the similitude of a temple. Their garners full, bursting from one into another;
their sheep fruitful; abundant in their streets; their oxen fat. There is no breaking down of
the fence, nor passage through; nor clamor in their streets. They call the people blessed
whose affairs are in this state.”1055 But what dost thou say, O prophet? “Blessed,” saith he,

“the people whose God is the Lord;” not the people affluent in wealth, but one adorned with
godliness;1056 that people, saith he, I esteem happy, although they suffer innumerable
hardships!</p>
<p>23. But if it were necessary to add a ninth1057 reason, we might say, that this tribulation
maketh those who are troubled more approved; “For tribulation worketh patience; and patience,
probation; and probation, hope; and hope maketh not ashamed.”1058 Do you see
that the probation, which comes of tribulation, fixes in us the hope of the good things to
come, and that the abiding in trials causes us to have a good hope of the future? So that I
did not say rashly, that these tribulations themselves mark out to us hopes of a resurrection,
and make those who are tried the better; for, he saith, “as gold is tried in a furnace, so an
acceptable man in the furnace of humiliation.”1059</p>
<p>24. There is besides a tenth reason to mention; and what is it, but the one I have before
frequently referred to? viz. that if we have any spots, we thus put them away. And the patriarch,
making this matter plain, said to the rich man, “Lazarus hath received1060 his evil
things,”1061 hence “he is comforted.” And besides this, we may find another reason, which
is to this effect; that our crowns and rewards are thus increased. For in proportion as tribulations
are more intense, so also are the rewards augmented; yea, even far more: “for the
sufferings of the present time,” it is said, “are not worthy to be compared to the glory that
shall be revealed in us.”1062 Thus many then being the reasons which we have to advance
for the afflictions of the saints, let us not take our trials amiss, or be distressed, or disturbed
on account of them; but both ourselves discipline our own souls, and teach others to do the
same.</p>
<p>25. And if, O beloved, thou seest a man living in virtue, keeping fast hold of spiritual
wisdom, pleasing God, yet suffering innumerable ills, do not stumble! And although thou
seest any one devoting himself to spiritual affairs, and about to achieve something useful,

yet presently supplanted, be not discouraged! For I know there are many who ofttimes
propose a question to this effect: “Such a one,” say they, “was performing a pilgrimage to
some Martyr’s shrine; and whilst conveying money to the poor, met with a shipwreck, and
lost all. Another man, in doing the like, fell among robbers, and scarcely saved his life,
leaving the place in a state of nudity.” What then should we say? Why that in neither of
these cases need one be sad. For if the one met with a shipwreck, yet he hath the fruit of his
righteousness complete inasmuch as he fulfilled all his own part. He collected the money
together, he stowed it away,1063 he took it with him, he departed on his pilgrimage; but the
shipwreck that followed was not of his own will. “But why did God permit it?” In order that
he might make the man approved. “But,” says one, “the poor were deprived of the money.”
Thou dost not so care for the poor, as the God who made them? for if they were deprived
of these things, He is able to provide a greater supply of wealth for them from another
quarter.</p>
<p>26. Let us not then call Him to account for what He does; but let us give Him glory in
all things. For it is not lightly and to no purpose that He often permits such events. But beside
that He does not overlook those that would have enjoyed comfort from such wealth; and
instead of it, affords them some other supply of sustenance; He also makes him who suffers
the shipwreck more approved, and provides him a greater reward; inasmuch as the giving
thanks to God, when one falls into such calamities, is a far greater matter than giving alms.
For not what we give in alms only, but whatever we have been deprived of by others, and
borne it with fortitude; this too brings us much fruit. And that you may learn, that the latter
is indeed the greater thing, I will make it evident from what befell Job. He, when a possessor
of wealth, opened his house to the poor, and whatever he had he bestowed; but he was not
so illustrious when he opened his house to the poor, as when, upon hearing that his house
had fallen down, he did not take it impatiently. He was not illustrious when he clad the naked
with the fleece of his flock, as he was illustrious and renowned when he heard that the fire
had fallen, and consumed all his flocks, and yet gave thanks. Before, he was a lover of man;
now, he was a lover of Wisdom. Before, he had compassion on the poor; but now he gave
thanks to the Lord! And he did not say to himself, “Why is it that this hath happened? The
flocks are consumed from which thousands of the poor were supported; and if I was unworthy
to enjoy such plenty, at least He should have spared me for the sake of the partakers.”</p>
<p>27. Nothing of this sort did Job utter, no nor think, because he knew that God was dispensing
all things for good. That you may learn, moreover, that he gave a heavier blow to
the devil after this, when, being stripped of all things, he gave thanks, than when, being in
possession of them, he gave alms; observe, that when he was in possession, the devil could
utter a certain suspicion, and however false, he yet could utter it: “Doth Job serve thee for
<note type="footnote">1063 Or, devoted it ‡π™θετο.</note>

<pb n="473"/>
nought?” But when he had taken all, and stripped him of everything, and the man yet retained
the same good will towards God, from that time his shameless mouth was stopped, and had
nothing further to allege. For the just man was more illustrious than in his former state.1064
For to bear nobly and thankfully the privation of all things, is a far greater thing than it was
to give alms whilst living in affluence; and it has been accordingly demonstrated in the case
of this just man. Before, there was much benignity to his fellow-servants; now, there was
exceeding love shown towards the Lord!</p>
<p>28. And I do not lengthen out this discourse without purpose; forasmuch as there are
many, who, often whilst engaged in works of mercy, as supporting widows, have been spoiled
of all their substance. Some again, by the accident of some fire, have lost their all; some have
met with shipwreck; others, by false informations and injuries of that sort, though they have
done many alms-deeds, have fallen into the extremes of poverty, sickness, and disease, and
have obtained no help from any one. Lest we should say then, as many often do, “No man
knoweth anything;”1065 what has just been said may suffice to remove all perplexity on this
point. Suppose it is objected that “such an one, after having done many alms-deeds, has lost
all?” And what if he had lost all? If he gives thanks for this loss, he will draw down much
greater favour from God! And he will not receive twofold, as Job did, but a hundredfold in
the life to come. But if here he does endure evil, the very circumstance of his sustaining all
with fortitude will bring him a greater treasure; for God permits him to fall from plenty to
poverty, for the purpose of calling him thus to the more frequent exercises, and greater
conflicts. Hath it happened as is often the case, that the fire seizing upon thy house, hath
burnt it up and devoured all thy substance? Remember what happened to Job; give thanks
to the Lord, who though he was able to forbid, did not forbid it; and thou wilt receive as
great a reward as if thou hadst deposited all thy wealth in the hands of the poor! But dost
thou spend thy days in poverty and hunger, and in the midst of a thousand dangers? Remember
Lazarus who had to buffet with disease, and poverty, and desolateness, and those other
innumerable trials; and that after so high a degree of virtue!1066 Remember the Apostles,
who lived in hunger, and thirst, and nakedness; the prophets, the patriarchs, the just men,

<pb n="474"/>
and you will find all these not among the rich or luxurious, but among the poor, the afflicted,
and the distressed! </p>
<p>29. Saying these things to thyself, give thanks unto the Lord, that he hath made thee to
be of this part, not hating thee, but loving thee greatly; since He would not have permitted
those men either to suffer thus, if he had not exceedingly loved them, because He made
them more illustrious by these evils. There is nothing so good as thanksgiving; even as there
is nothing worse than blasphemy. We should not wonder that when we become intent upon
spiritual things, we suffer much that is grievous. For as thieves do not dig through and assiduously
keep watch there, where there is hay, and chaff, and straw, but where there is gold
and silver; so also the devil besets those especially who are engaged in spiritual matters.
Where virtue is, there are many snares! where alms-giving is, there is envy! But we have one
weapon which is the best, and sufficient to repel all such engines as these; in everything to
give thanks to God. Tell me, did not Abel, when offering the first fruits to God, fall by the
hand of his brother? But yet God permitted it, not hating one who had honoured him, but
loving him greatly; and beside that which came of that excellent sacrifice, providing him
another crown by martyrdom. Moses wished to protect a certain one who was injured, and
he was put into the extremest peril, and banished his country.1067 This too God permitted,
that thou mightest learn the patience of the saints. For if, foreknowing that we should suffer
nothing of a grievous kind, we then put our hands to the work of religion, we should not
seem to be doing anything great, as having such a pledge of safety. But as it is, those who
do such things are the more to be wondered at, even for this; because, though they foresee
dangers, and punishments, and deaths, and ten thousand evils, still they did not desist from
those good works, nor become less zealous from the expectation of terrors.1068</p>
<p>30. As, therefore, the Three Children said, “There is a God in heaven, who is able to
deliver us; and if not, let it be known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, and
that we will not worship the golden image which thou hast set up.”1069 Do thou also, when
about to perform any duty to God, look forward to manifold dangers, manifold punishments,
manifold deaths; and be not surprised, nor be disturbed, if such things happen. For it is said,
“My Son, if thou come to serve the Lord, prepare thy soul for temptation.”1070 For surely
no one choosing to fight,1071 expects to carry off the crown without wounds! And thou,
therefore, who hast undertaken to wage a complete combat1072 with the devil, think not to

pursue a life without danger, and full of luxury! God hath not pledged to thee His recompense
and His promise here; but everything that is splendid for thee in the future life! Be glad and
rejoice then, if when thou hast thyself done any good action, thou receive the contrary, or
if thou see another suffering this; inasmuch as this becomes to thee the source of a higher
recompense! Do not be downcast: nor give up thy zeal, nor become the more torpid; but
rather press onward with more eagerness; since even the Apostles, when they preached, although
scourged, stoned, and constant inmates of the prisons, did not only after deliverance
from dangers, but also in those very dangers, announce with greater forwardness the message
of Truth. Paul is to be seen in prison, yea, even in chains, instructing and initiating:1073 and
moreover doing the very same in a court of justice, in shipwreck, in tempest, and in a
thousand dangers. Do thou too imitate these saints, and cease not from good works, so long
as thou art able; and although thou seest the devil thwarting thee ten thousand times, never
fall back! Thou perchance, bearing with thee thy wealth, hast met with shipwreck; but Paul
carrying the word, far more precious than all wealth, was going to Rome, and was wrecked;
and sustained innumerable hardships. And this he himself signified, when he said, “Many
times we desired to come unto you, but Satan hindered us.”1074 And God permitted it; thus
revealing the more abundantly His power, and showing that the multitude of things which
the devil did, or prevented from being done, neither lessened nor interrupted the preaching
of the Gospel. On this account Paul gave God thanks in all things; and knowing that he was
himself thereby rendered more approved, he exhibited his exceeding forwardness on every
occasion, letting none of these impediments prevent him!</p>
<p>31. As often then as we are frustrated in spiritual works, so often let us again take them
in hand; and let us not say, “for what reason did God permit these impediments?” for He
permitted them to this end, that He might show thy alacrity much more to others, and thy
great love; this being the special mark of one that loves, never to desist from those things
which are approved by him whom he loves. The man, indeed, who is flaccid and listless,
will fall back from the first shock; but he who is energetic and alert, although he be hindered
a thousand times, will devote himself so much the more to the things of God; fulfilling all
as far as he is able; and in everything giving thanks. This then let us do! Thanksgiving is a
great treasure; large wealth; a good that cannot be taken away; a powerful weapon! Even as
blasphemy increases our present mishap; and makes us lose much more beside than we
have lost already. Hast thou lost money? If thou hast been thankful, thou hast gained thy
soul; and obtained greater wealth; having acquired a greater measure of the favour of God.
But if thou blasphemest, thou hast, besides this, lost thine own safety; and hast not regained
possession of thy wealth; yea and thy soul, which thou hadst, thou hast sacrificed!</p>

<p>32. But since our discourse has now turned to the subject of blasphemy, I desire to ask
one favor of you all, in return for this my address, and speaking with you; which is, that you
will correct on my behalf the blasphemers of this city. And should you hear any one in the
public thoroughfare, or in the midst of the forum, blaspheming God; go up to him and rebuke
him; and should it be necessary to inflict blows, spare not to do so. Smite him on the face;
strike his mouth; sanctify thy hand with the blow, and if any should accuse thee, and drag
thee to the place of justice, follow them thither; and when the judge on the bench calls thee
to account, say boldly that the man blasphemed the King of angels! For if it be necessary to
punish those who blaspheme an earthly king, much more so those who insult God. It is a
common crime, a public injury; and it is lawful for every one who is willing, to bring forward
an accusation. Let the Jews and Greeks learn, that the Christians are the saviours of the city;
that they are its guardians, its patrons, and its teachers. Let the dissolute and the perverse
also learn this; that they must fear the servants of God too; that if at any time they are inclined
to utter such a thing, they may look round every way at each other, and tremble even at
their own shadows, anxious lest perchance a Christian, having heard what they said, should
spring upon them and sharply chastise them. Have you not heard what John did? He saw
a man that was a tyrant overthrowing the laws of marriage; and with boldness, he proclaimed
in the midst of the forum, “It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother Philip’s wife.”1075
But I urge thee on, not against a prince or a judge; nor against the marriage ordinance outraged;
nor in behalf of fellow-servants insulted. But I require thee to castigate an equal, for
insolence against the Lord. Truly, if I had said unto thee, punish and correct those kings or
judges who transgress the laws, would you not say that I was mad? But John forsooth acted
thus. So that even this is not too much for us. Now then, at least, correct a fellow-servant;
an equal; and although it should be necessary to die, do not shrink from chastising1076 a
brother. This is thy martyrdom, since John was also a martyr. And although he was not
commanded to sacrifice, nor to worship an idol, yet for the sacred laws that were despised,
he laid down his head. Do thou too then contend, even to the death, for the truth, and God
will fight for thee! And make me not this cold reply. “What matters it to me? I have nothing
in common with him.”1077 With the devil alone we have nothing in common, but with all
men we have many things in common; for they partake of the same nature with us; they
inhabit the same earth, and they are nourished with the same food; they have the same Lord;
they have received the same laws, and are invited to the same blessings with ourselves. Let
us not say then, that we have nothing in common with them; for this is a satanic speech; a

diabolical inhumanity. Therefore let us not give utterance to such words, but exhibit such
a tender care as becomes brethren!</p>
<p>33. This indeed I, for my part, engage with the strictest certainty, and pledge myself to
you all, that if all you who are present will but choose to take in hand the safety of the inhabitants
of this city, we shall speedily have it amended throughout. And this, even although
but the least part of the city is here; the least as to multitude, but the chief part as it respects
piety. Let us take in hand the safety of our brethren! One man inflamed with zeal is sufficient
to reform a whole community! But when not merely one, or two, or three, but so great a
multitude are able to take on them the care of the neglected, it is in no other way but by our
own supineness, and not from our want of strength, that the majority perish and fall. Is it
not indeed absurd? When we happen to see a fight taking place in the forum, we go into the
midst of it, and reconcile the combatants! But why do I speak of a fight? If, perchance, we
see an ass fallen down, we all make haste to stretch out a hand to raise him up. Yet we neglect
our perishing brethren! The blasphemer is an ass; unable to bear the burden of his anger,
he has fallen. Come forward and raise him up, both by words and by deeds; and both by
meekness and by vehemence; let the medicine be various. And if we thus administer our
own part, and take pains for the safety of our neighbours, we shall soon become objects of
desire and affection to the very persons who have the benefit of our correction; and what is
more than all, we shall enjoy those good things which are laid up in store. Which God grant
that we may all obtain, by the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ; through whom and
with whom, to the Father with the Holy Ghost, be glory and power and honor, both now
and always, and forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily II.</head>
<p>Spoken in Antioch in the Old Church, as it was called, while he was a presbyter, on the subject
of the calamity that had befallen the city in consequence of the tumult connected with the
overthrow of the Statues of the Emperor Theodosius, the Great and Pious. And on the
saying of the Apostle, “Charge them that are rich that they be not high-minded,” 1 Timothy
vi. 17. And against covetousness.</p>
<p>1. What shall I say, or what shall I speak of? The present season is one for tears, and not
for words; for lamentation, not for discourse; for prayer, not for preaching. Such is the
magnitude of the deeds daringly done; so incurable is the wound, so deep the blow, even
beyond the power of all treatment, and craving assistance from above. Thus it was that Job,
when he had lost all, sat himself down upon a dunghill; and his friends heard of it, and came,
and seeing him, while yet afar off, they rent their garments, and sprinkled themselves with
ashes, and made great lamentation.1078 The same thing now ought all the cities around to
do, to come to our city and to lament with all sympathy what has befallen us. He then sat
down on his dunghill; she is now seated in the midst of a great snare. For even as the devil
then leaped violently the flocks, and herds, and all the substance of the just man, so now
hath he raged against this whole city. But then, as well as now, God permitted it; then, indeed,
that he might make the just man more illustrious by the greatness of his trials; and now,
that he may make us more sober-minded by the extremity of this tribulation. Suffer me to
mourn over our present state. We have been silent seven days, even as the friends of Job
were.1079 Suffer me to open my mouth to-day, and to bewail this common calamity.</p>
<p>2. Who, beloved, hath bewitched us? Who hath envied us? Whence hath all this change
come over us? Nothing was more dignified than our city! Now, never was anything more
pitiable! The populace so well ordered and quiet, yea, even like a tractable and well tamed
steed, always submissive to the hands of its rulers, hath now so suddenly started off with us,
as to have wrought such evils, as one can hardly dare to mention.</p>
<p>I mourn now and lament, not for the greatness of that wrath which is to be expected,
but for the extravagance of the frenzy which has been manifested! For although the Emperor
should not be provoked, or in anger, although he were neither to punish, nor take vengeance;
how, I pray, are we to bear the shame of all that has been done? I find the word of instruction
broken off by lamentation; scarcely am I able to open my mouth, to part my lips, to move
my tongue, or to utter a syllable! So, even like a curb, the weight of grief checks my tongue,
and keeps back what I would say.</p>

<p>3. Aforetime there was nothing happier than our city; nothing more melancholy than
it is now become. As bees buzzing around their hive, so before this the inhabitants every
day flitted about the forum, and all pronounced us happy in being so numerous. But behold
now, this hive hath become solitary! For even as smoke does those bees, so fear hath driven
away our swarms; and what the prophet says, bewailing Jerusalem, we may fitly say now,
“Our city is become ‘like a terebinth that hath lost its leaves,1080 and as a garden that hath
no water.’”1081 For in like manner as a garden when its irrigation fails, exhibits the trees
stripped of their leaves, and bare of their fruits, so has it now fared with our city. For the
help from above having forsaken her, she stands desolate stripped of almost all her inhabitants.</p>
<p>4. Nothing is sweeter than one’s own country; but now, it has come to pass that nothing
is more bitter! All flee from the place which brought them forth, as from a snare. They desert
it as they would a dungeon; they leap out of it, as from a fire. And just as when a house is
seized upon by the flames, not only those who dwell therein, but all who are near, take their
flight from it with the utmost haste, eager to save but their bare bodies; even so now too,
when the wrath of the Emperor is expected to come as a fire1082 from above, every one
presses to go forth in time, and to save the bare body, before the fire in its progress reaches
them. And now our calamity has become an enigma; a flight without enemies; an expulsion
of inhabitants without a battle; a captivity without capture! We have not seen the fire of
barbarians, nor beheld the face of enemies: and yet we experience the sufferings of captives.
All men now hear of our calamities; for receiving our exiles, they learn from them the stroke
which has fallen upon our city.</p>
<p>5. Yet I am not ashamed, nor blush at this. Let all men learn the sufferings of the city,
that, sympathizing with their mother, they may lift up their united voice to God from the
whole earth; and with one consent entreat the King of heaven for their universal nurse and
parent.1083 Lately our city was shaken;1084 but now the very souls of the inhabitants totter!
Then the foundations of the houses shook, but now the very foundations of every heart
quiver; and we all see death daily before our eyes! We live in constant terror, and endure
the penalty of Cain; a more pitiable one than that of those who were the former inmates of

the prison; undergoing as we now do a new and strange kind of siege, far more terrible than
the ordinary kind. For they who suffer this from enemies, are only shut up within the walls;
but even the forum has become impassable to us, and every one is pent up within the walls
of his own house! And as it is not safe for those who are beseiged to go beyond the walls,
while the enemy without is encamped around; so neither, to many of those who inhabit this
city, is it safe to go out of doors, or to appear openly; on account of those who are everywhere
hunting for the innocent as well as the guilty; and seizing them even in the midst of the
forum, and dragging them to the court of justice, without ceremony, and just as chance
directs.1085 For this reason, free-men sit in doors shackled up with their domestics; anxiously
and minutely enquiring of those to whom they may safely put the question, “Who has been
seized to-day; who carried off;1086 or punished? How was it? and in what manner?” They
live a life more wretched than any kind of death; being compelled daily to mourn the
calamities of others; while they tremble for their own safety, and are in no better case than
the dead; inasmuch as they are already dead with fear.</p>
<p>6. But if any one who is devoid of this fear and anguish, chooses to enter the forum, he
is presently driven back to his own dwelling, by the cheerless spectacle; finding hardly perchance
one or two people, and those hanging their heads and creeping about with downcast
looks, where but a few days before the multitude swept along more incessantly than1087 the
streams of rivers. Yet all these have now been driven away from us! And, as when many
trees in a thick wood of oak are cut down in all directions, the spectacle becomes a melancholy
one, even like that of a head with many patches of baldness; even so the city itself, its inhab-
itants being diminished and but few appearing here and there, is now become dreary, and
sheds a heavy mist of sorrow over those who witness it. And not the ground only, but the
very nature of the air, and even the circle of the sun’s beams, seem now to me to look
mournful, and to shine more dimly; not that the elements change their nature, but that our
eyes being confused by the cloud of sadness, are unable to receive the light of the rays clearly,
or with the same relish. This is what the prophet of old bewailed, when he said, “The sun
shall go down at noon, and the day shall be darkened.”1088 And this he said, not as though
the Day Star1089 should be eclipsed, or the day should disappear, but because those who are
in sorrow, are not able to perceive the light even of noon day on account of the darkness of
their anguish; which indeed has been the case now. And wherever any one looks abroad,

whether upon the ground or upon the walls; whether upon the columns of the city, or upon
his neighbours, he seems to see night and deep gloom; so full is all of melancholy! There is
a silence big with horror, and loneliness everywhere; and that dear hum of the multitude is
stifled; and even as though all were gone beneath the earth, so speechlessness hath now
taken possession of the city; and all men seem like stones, and being oppressed by the
calamity like a gag on their tongues; they maintain the profoundest silence, yea, such a silence
as if enemies had come on them, and had consumed them all at once by fire and sword!</p>
<p>7. Now is it a fit season to say, “Call for the mourning women, that they may come, and
for the cunning women, and let them take up a wailing. Let your1090 eyes run down with
water, and your eyelids gush out with tears.”1091 Ye hills take up wailing, and ye mountains
lamentation! Let us call the whole creation into sympathy with our evils. So great a city, and
the head of those which lie under the eastern sky, is in danger of being torn away from the
midst of the civilized world! She that had so many children, has now suddenly become
childless, and there is no one who shall come to her aid! For he who has been insulted has
not an equal in dignity upon earth; for he is a monarch; the summit and head of all here
below! On this account then let us take refuge in the King that is above. Him let us call in
to our aid. If we may not obtain the favour of heaven, there is no consolation left for what
has befallen us!</p>
<p>8. Here I could wish to end this discourse; for the minds of those who are in anguish
are indisposed to extend their discourses to a great length. And as when some dense cloud
has formed, and flying under the solar rays, returns back to him all his splendour again, so
indeed does the cloud of sadness, when it stands before our souls, refuse to admit an easy
passage for the word, but chokes it and restrains it forcibly within. And this is the case not
only with those who speak, but with those who hear; for as it does not suffer the word to
burst forth freely from the soul of the speaker, so neither does it suffer it to sink into the
mind of those who listen, with its natural power. Therefore also the Jews of old time, while
slaving at the mud and bricks, had not the heart to listen to Moses, while he repeatedly told
them great things respecting their future deliverance; despondency making their minds inaccessible
to the address, and shutting up their sense of hearing. I could have wished then,
as to myself, to have put an end here to my discourse; but thinking that it is not only the
nature of a cloud to intercept the forward passage of the sun’s rays, but that often just the
opposite happens to the cloud; since the sun continually falling upon it with much warmth,
wears it away, and frequently breaks through the midst of it; and shining forth all at once,
meets cheerfully the gaze of the beholders. This also I myself expect to do this day; and the
word being continually associated with your minds, and dwelling in them, I hope to burst

the cloud of sadness, and to shine through your understandings again, with the customary
instruction!</p>
<p>9. But afford me your attention! Lend me your ears awhile! Shake off this despondency!
Let us return to our former custom;1092 and as we have been used always to meet here with
gladness, so let us also do now, casting all upon God. And this will contribute towards our
actual deliverance from calamity. For should the Lord see that His words are listened to
carefully; and that our love of divine wisdom stands the trial of the difficulty of these times,
He will quickly take us up again, and will make out of the present tempest a calm and happy
change. For this too is a thing in which it behoves the Christian to differ from the unbelievers,
the bearing all things nobly; and through hope of the future, soaring above the attack of
human evils. The believer hath his stand on the Rock; for this reason he cannot be overthrown
by the dashing of the billows. For should the waves of temptation rise, they cannot reach to
his feet. He stands too lofty for any such assault. Let us not then sink down, beloved! We
do not care so much for our own safety, as God who made us. There is not so much solicitude
on our part, lest we suffer any dreadful misfortune, as with Him who bestowed upon us a
soul, and then gave us so many good things beside. Let us mount on the wings of these
hopes, and hear the things about to be spoken with our accustomed readiness.</p>
<p>10. I made a prolonged discourse lately unto you beloved, and yet I saw all following it
up, and no one turning back in the middle of the course.1093 I return thanks to you for that
readiness, and have received the reward of my labours. But there was another reward, besides
that attention, which I asked of you at that time; perchance you know and recollect it. And
what was the reward? That you should punish and chastise the blasphemers that were in
the city; that ye should restrain those who are violent and insolent against God! I do not
think that I then spoke these things of myself; but that God, foreseeing what was coming,
injected these words into my mind; for if we had punished those who dared to do such
things, that which has now happened would never have happened. How much better would
it have been, if necessity so required, to run into danger; yea, to suffer in castigating and
correcting such persons (which would have brought us a martyr’s crown), than now to fear,
to tremble, and to expect death, from the insubordination of such persons! Behold, the crime
was that of a few, but the blame comes on all! Behold, through these, we are all now placed

in fear, and are ourselves suffering the punishment of what these men dared to do! But if
we had taken them in time, and cast them out of the city, and chastised them, and corrected
the sick member, we should not have been subjected to our present terror. I know that the
manners of this city have been of a noble character from old times;1094 but that certain
strangers, and men of mixed race,—accursed and pernicious characters,—hopeless of their
own safety, have perpetrated what has been perpetrated. For this very reason I was always
lifting up my voice, and unceasingly bearing my testimony, saying, Let us punish the madness
of those blasphemers,—let us control their spirit, and provide for their salvation;—yea,
though it be necessary to die in doing it, the deed would yet bring us great gain: let us not
overlook the insult done to our common Lord; overlooking such things will bring forth
some great evil to our city!</p>
<p>11. These things I foretold, and they have now actually taken place;—and we are paying
the penalty of that listlessness! You overlooked the insult that was done unto God!—Behold,
he hath permitted the Emperor to be insulted, and peril to the utmost to hang over all, in
order that we might pay by this fear the penalty of that listlessness; was it then vainly, and
to no purpose I foretold these things, and assiduously urged your Charity? But nevertheless,
nothing was done. Let it, however, be done now; and being chastened by our present
calamity, let us now restrain the disorderly madness of these men. Let us shut up their
mouths, even as we close up pestiferous fountains; and let us turn them to a contrary course,
and the evils which have taken hold of the city shall undoubtedly be stayed. The Church is
not a theatre, that we should listen for amusement. With profit ought we to depart hence,
and some fresh and great gain should we acquire ere we leave this place. For it is but vainly
and irrationally we meet together, if we have been but captivated for a time, and return
home empty, and void of all improvement from the things spoken.</p>
<p>12. What need have I of these plaudits, these cheers and tumultuous signs of approval?
1095 The praise I seek, is that ye show forth all I have said in your works. Then am I an
enviable and happy man, not when ye approve, but when ye perform with all readiness,
whatsoever ye hear from me? Let every one then correct his neighbour, for “edify ye one
another,”1096 it is said, and if we do not this, the crimes of each one will bring some general
and intolerable damage to the city. Behold, while we are unconscious of any part in this
transaction, we are no less affrighted than those who were daringly engaged in it! We are
dreading lest the wrath of the Emperor should descend upon all; and it is not sufficient for
us to say in defence, “I was not present; I was not an accomplice, nor a participator in these
acts.” “For this reason,” he may reply, “thou shalt be punished, and pay the extreme penalty,

because thou wert not present; and didst not check, nor restrain the rioters, and didst not
run any risk for the honour of the Emperor! Hadst thou no part in these audacious deeds?
I commend this, and take it well. But thou didst not check these things when being done.
This is a cause of accusation!” Such words as these, we shall also hear from God, if we silently
suffer the continuance of the injuries and insults committed against Him. For he also who
had buried his talent in the earth, was called to account, not for crimes done by himself, for
he had given back the whole of that which was entrusted to him, but because he had not
increased it; because he had not instructed others; because he had not deposited it in the
hands of the bankers; that is, he had not admonished, or counselled, or rebuked, or amended
those unruly sinners who were his neighbours. On this account he was sent away without
reprieve to those intolerable punishments! But I fully trust that though ye did not before,
ye will now at least perform this work of correction, and not overlook insult committed
against God. For the events which have taken place are sufficient, even if no one had given
any warning, to convince men ever so disposed to be insensible, that they must exert
themselves for their own safety.</p>
<p>13. But it is now time that we should proceed to lay out before you the customary table
from St. Paul, by handling the subject of this day’s reading, and placing it in view for you
all. What then was the text read today?1097 “Charge them that are rich in this world that
they be not high-minded.”1098 When he says, “the rich in this world,” he makes it manifest,
that there are others who are rich, that is, in the world to come: such as was that Lazarus,
poor as to the present life, but rich as to the future; not in gold and silver, and such like
perishable and transitory store of wealth; but in those unutterable good things “which eye
hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man.”1099 For this is true
wealth and opulence, when there is good unmixed, and not subject to any change. Not such
was the case of that rich man who despised him, but he became the poorest of mankind.
Afterwards at least when he sought to obtain but a drop of water, he did not get possession
even of that, to such extreme poverty was he come. For this reason he calls them rich “in
the present world,” to teach thee that along with the present life, worldly wealth is annihilated.
It goes no further, neither does it change its place with its migrating possessors, but it often
leaves them before their end; which therefore he shows by saying, “Neither trust in uncertain
riches;” for nothing is so faithless as wealth; of which I have often said, and will not cease
to say, that it is a runaway, thankless servant, having no fidelity; and should you throw over
him ten thousand chains, he will make off dragging his chains after him. Frequently, indeed,

have those who possessed him shut him up with bars and doors, placing their slaves round
about for guards. But he has over-persuaded these very servants, and has fled away together
with his guards; dragging his keepers after him like a chain, so little security was there in
this custody. What then can be more faithless than this? what more wretched than men
devoted to it? When men endeavour with all eagerness to collect so frail and fleeting a thing,
they do not hear what the prophet saith: “Woe unto them who trust in their power, and
boast themselves in the multitude of their riches.”1100 Tell me why is this woe pronounced?—“
He heapeth up treasure,” saith he, “and knoweth not for whom he will gather
it,”1101—forasmuch as the labor is certain, but the enjoyment uncertain. Very often you toil
and endure trouble for enemies. The inheritance of your wealth after your decease, coming
as it does, in many instances, to those who have injured you, and plotted against you in a
thousand ways, has assigned you the sins for your part, but the enjoyment to others!</p>
<p>14. But here, it is worthy of enquiry, for what reason he does not say, “Charge those
who are rich in the present world, not to be rich; charge them to become poor; charge them
to get rid of what they have;” but, “charge them, not to be high-minded.” For he knew that
the root and foundation of riches is pride; and that if any man understood how to be unassuming,
he would not make much ado about the matter. Tell me, indeed, for what reason
thou leadest about so many servants, parasites, and flatterers, and all the other forms of
pomp? Not for necessity, but only for pride; to the end that by these thou mayest seem more
dignified than other men! Besides, he knew that wealth is not forbidden if it be used for that
which is necessary. For as I observed,1102 wine is not a bad thing, but drunkenness is so. A
covetous man is one thing, and a rich man is another thing. The covetous man is not rich;
he is in want of many things, and while he needs many things, he can never be rich. The
covetous man is a keeper, not a master, of wealth; a slave, not a lord. For he would sooner
give any one a portion of his flesh, than his buried gold. And as though he were ordered
and compelled of some one to touch nothing of these hidden treasures, so with all earnestness
he watches and keeps them, abstaining from his own, as if it were another’s. And certainly,
they are not his own. For what he can neither determine to bestow upon others, nor to distribute
to the necessitous, although he may sustain infinite punishments, how can he possibly
account his own? How does he hold possession of those things, of which he has neither the
free use, nor enjoyment? But besides this,—Paul is not accustomed to enjoin everything on
every man, but accommodates himself to the weakness of his hearers, even, indeed, as Christ
also did. For when that rich man came to him, and asked him concerning Life, he did not
say at once, “Go, sell that thou hast,”1103 but omitting this, he spoke to him of other com-

mandments. Nor afterwards, when he challenged1104 Him and said, “What lack I yet?” did
He simply say, “Sell what thou hast;” but, “If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou
hast.”1105 “I lay it down for your determination. I give you full power to choose. I do not
lay upon you any necessity.” For this reason also, Paul spoke nothing to the rich concerning
poverty, but concerning humility; as well because of the weakness of his hearers, as because
he perfectly knew, that could he bring them to exercise moderation, and to be free from
pride, he should also quickly free them from eagerness about being rich.</p>
<p>15. And further, after giving this admonition, “not to be high-minded,” he also taught
the manner in which they would be able to avoid being so. And how was it? That they should
consider the nature of wealth, how uncertain and faithless it is! therefore he goes on to say,
“Neither trust in uncertain riches.” The rich man is not one who is in possession of much,
but one who gives much. Abraham was rich, but he was not covetous; for he turned not his
thoughts to the house of this man, nor prayed into the wealth of that man; but going forth
he looked around wherever there chanced to be a stranger, or a poor man, in order that he
might succour poverty, and hospitably entertain the traveller. He covered not his roof with
gold, but fixing his tent near the oak, he was contented with the shadow of its leaves. Yet so
illustrious was his lodging, that angels were not ashamed to tarry with him; for they sought
not splendour of abode, but virtue of soul. This man then let us imitate, beloved, and bestow
what we have upon the needy. That lodging was rudely prepared, but it was more illustrious
than the halls of kings. No king has ever entertained angels; but he, dwelling under that oak,
and having but pitched a tent, was thought worthy of that honour: not receiving the honour
on account of the meanness of his dwelling, but enjoying that benefit on account of the
magnificence of his soul, and the wealth therein deposited.</p>
<p>16. Let us too, then, adorn not our houses, but our souls in preference to the house. For
is it not disgraceful to clothe our walls with marble, vainly and to no end, and to neglect
Christ going about naked? What does thy house profit thee, O man! For wilt thou take it
with thee when thou departest? This thou canst not take with thee, when thou departest.
But thy soul, when thou departest, thou shalt assuredly take with thee! Behold now this
great danger has overtaken us! Let your houses stand by you! Let them deliver you from the
threatened peril! but they cannot! And ye yourselves are witnesses, who are leaving them
solitary, and hurrying forth to the wilderness; fearing them as ye would do snares and nets!
Let riches now lend assistance! But it is no time for them to do so! If then the power of riches
is found wanting before the wrath of man, much rather will this be the case, before the divine
and inexorable tribunal! If it is but a man that is provoked and offended, and even now gold
is of no avail, much more will the power of money be utterly impotent then, when God is

angry, who has no need of wealth! We build houses that we may have a habitation; not that
we may make an ambitious display. What is beyond our wants, is superfluous and useless.
Put on a sandal which is larger than your foot! you will not endure it; for it is a hindrance
to the step. Thus also a house larger than necessity requires, is an impediment to your progress
towards heaven. Do you wish to build large and splendid houses? I forbid it not; but
let it be not upon the earth! Build thyself tabernacles in heaven, and such that thou mayest
be able to receive others;1106—tabernacles which never fall to pieces. Why art thou mad
about fleeting things; and things that must be left here? Nothing is more slippery than wealth.
To-day it is for thee; tomorrow it is against thee. It arms the eyes of the envious everywhere.
It is a hostile comrade, a domestic enemy; and ye are witnesses of this, who possess it, and
are in every way burying and concealing it from view; as even now too our very wealth
makes the danger more insupportable to us! Thou seest indeed the poor ready for action,
disengaged, and prepared for all things; but the wealthy in great perplexity, and wandering
about, seeking where they may bury their gold, or seeking with whom they may deposit it!
Why, O man, dost thou seek thy fellow slaves? Christ stands ready to receive, and to keep
thy deposits for thee; and not to keep only, but also to augment them, and to pay them back
with much interest. Out of His hand no man can forcibly take them away. And He not only
keeps the deposit, but for this very thing He also frees thee from thy perils. For among men,
they who receive treasures in trust think that they have done us a favour, in keeping that of
which they took charge; but with Christ it is the contrary; for He does not say that He has
conferred, but that He has received a favour, when He receives thy deposited treasures; and
for the guardianship which He exercises over thy wealth, He does not demand a recompense
of thee, but gives thee a recompense!</p>
<p>17. What defence then can we claim, or what excuse, when we pass by Him who is able
to keep, and who is thankful for the trust giving in return great and unspeakable rewards,
and in place of this guardianship commit our treasures to men who have not the power to
keep them, and who think they grant us a favour, and pay us back at last only that which
was given them. Thou art a stranger and a pilgrim with respect to the things here! Thou
hast a country which is thine own in the heavens! There transfer all;—that before the actual
enjoyment, thou mayest enjoy the recompense here. He who is nourished with good hopes,
and is confident respecting things to come, hath here already tasted of the kingdom! For
nothing ordinarily so repairs the soul, and makes a man better, as a good hope of things to
come; so that if thou transfer thy wealth there, thou mayest then provide for thy soul with
suitable leisure. For they who spend all their endeavours upon the decoration of their
dwelling, rich as they are in outward things, are careless of that which is within, letting their

soul abide desolate and squalid, and full of cobwebs. But if they would be indifferent to exterior
things, and earnestly expend all their attention upon the mind, adorning this at all
points; then the soul of such men would be a resting place for Christ. And having Christ for
its inhabitant, what could ever be more blessed? Wouldest thou be rich? Have God for thy
friend, and thou shalt be richer than all men!—Wouldest thou be rich? Be not highminded!—
This rule is suitable not only to things future, but to things present. For there is
no such object of envy, as a man of wealth; but when pride is super-added, a two-fold precipice
is formed; the war becomes fiercer on all sides. But if you know how to exercise
moderation, you undermine the tyranny of envy by your humility; and you possess whatever
you do possess with safety. For such is the nature of virtue, that it not only profits us, as it
respects futurity, but it also here bestows a present reward.</p>
<p>18. Let us not then be high-minded in reference to riches, or indeed to any other thing;
for if even in spiritual things the man who is high-minded is fallen, and undone, much more
so as to carnal things. Let us be mindful of our nature. Let us recollect our sins. Let us understand
what we are; and this will provide a sufficient groundwork for complete humility.
Tell me not, “I have laid up the revenues of this or that number of years; myriads of talents
of gold; gains that are increasing every day.” Say as much as you will, you say all in vain,
and to no purpose. Very often in one hour, yea, in one short moment, just as the light dust,
when the wind rushes down upon it from above, are all these things swept out of the house
by a blast. Our life is full of such examples, and the Scriptures abound with lessons of this
sort. He who is rich to-day, is poor tomorrow. Wherefore, I have often smiled, when reading
wills that said, let such a man have the ownership of these fields, or of this house, and another
the use thereof. For we all have the use, but no man has the ownership.1107 For although
riches may remain with us all our lifetime, undergoing no change, we must transfer them
in the end, whether we will or no, into the hands of others; having enjoyed only the use of
them, and departing to another life naked and destitute of this ownership! Whence it is
plain, that they only have the ownership of property, who have despised its use, and derided
its enjoyment. For the man that has cast his substance away from him, and bestowed it on
the poor, he uses it as he ought; and takes with him the ownership of these things when he
departs, not being stripped of the possession even in death, but at that time receiving all
back again; yea, and much more than these things, at that day of judgment, when he most
needs their protection,1108 and when we shall all have to render up an account of the deeds
we have done. So that if any one wishes to have the possession of his riches, and the use and

we may have benefitted as even of more avail; also in the Homilies on 2 Cor. iv. 13, no. 3, v. fin., he refers to
Luke xvi. 9, and soon after calls the poor προσ€ται, in this sense. See Cat. Aur. on that passage.</note>

<pb n="489"/>
the ownership entire, let him disencumber himself from them all; since, truly, he who doth
not this must at all events be separated from them at death; and frequently before his death
will lose them, in the midst of dangers and innumerable ills.</p>
<p>19. And this is not the only disaster, that the change comes suddenly; but that the rich
man comes unpractised to the endurance of poverty. But not so the poor man; for he confides
not in gold and silver, which are lifeless matter, but in “God, who giveth us all things richly
to enjoy.” So that the rich man stands in more uncertainty than the poor man, experiencing,
as he does, frequent and diversified changes. What is the sense of this? “Who giveth to us
all things richly to enjoy.”1109 God giveth all those things with liberality, which are more
necessary than riches; such, for example, as the air, the water, the fire, the sun; all things of
this kind. The rich man is not able to say that he enjoys more of the sunbeams than the poor
man; he is not able to say that he breathes more plenteous air: but all these are offered alike
to all. And wherefore, one may say, is it the greater and more necessary blessings, and those
which maintain our life, that God hath made common; but the smaller and less valuable (I
speak of money) are not thus common. Why is this? In order that our life might be disciplined,
and that we might have training ground for virtue. For if these necessaries were not
common, perhaps they who are rich, practising their usual covetousness, would strangle
those who were poor. For if they do this for the sake of money, much rather would they do
so for the things referred to. Again, if money was also an universal possession, and were
offered in the same manner to all, the occasion for almsgiving, and the opportunity for benevolence,
would be taken away.</p>
<p>20. That we may live then securely, the sources of our existence have been made common.
On the other hand, to the end that we may have an opportunity of gaining crowns and good
report, property has not been made common; in order that hating covetousness, and following
after righteousness, and freely bestowing our goods upon the poor, we may by this method
obtain a certain kind of relief for our sins.1110 God hath made thee rich, why makest thou
thyself poor? He hath made thee rich that thou mayest assist the needy; that thou mayest
have release of thine own sins, by liberality to others. He hath given thee money, not that
thou mayest shut it up for thy destruction, but that thou mayest pour it forth for thy salvation.
For this reason also He hath made the possession of riches uncertain and unstable, that by
this means he might slack the intensity of thy madness concerning it. For if its possessors,
even now whilst they can have no confidence in regard to it, but behold a multitude of snares
produced from this quarter, are so inflamed with the desire of these things; if the elements

<pb n="490"/>
of security and stability were added to wealth, whom would they have spared? From whom
would they have refrained? From what widows? From what orphans? From what poor?</p>
<p>21. Wherefore let us not consider riches to be a great good; for the great good is, not to
possess money, but to possess the fear of God and all manner of piety. Behold, now if there
were any righteous man here, having great boldness toward God,1111 notwithstanding he
might be the poorest of mortals, he would be sufficient to liberate us from present evils! For
he only needed to spread forth his hands towards heaven, and to call upon God, and this
cloud would pass away! But now gold is treasured up in abundance; and yet it is more useless
than mere clay for the purpose of deliverance from the impending calamities! Nor is it only
in a peril of this kind; but should disease or death, or any such evil befall us, the impotency
of wealth is fully proved, since it is at a loss, and has no consolation of its own to offer us
amidst these events.</p>
<p>22. There is one thing in which wealth seems to have an advantage over poverty, viz.
that it lives in a state of daily luxury, and is supplied with an abundance of pleasure in its
banquets. This however may also be seen exemplified at the table of the poor; and these
enjoy there a pleasure superior to that of the rich. And marvel not at this, nor think what I
say a paradox; for I will make the matter clear to you from the evidence of facts. Ye know
of course, and ye all confess that in feasts it is not the nature of the viands, but the disposition
of those who feast upon them, which usually causes the pleasure; for instance, when any
one comes to the table hungry, the food will taste sweeter than any delicacy, or condiment,
or a thousand exquisite preparations for the palate, although it may be the most common
article of diet. But he who without tarrying for necessity, or first waiting till he is hungry,
(as the custom is with the wealthy), when he comes to the table, notwithstanding he finds
the most refined dainties spread before him, has no sensation of pleasure, his appetite not
being previously excited. And that you may learn that this is the actual state of the case, besides
that you are all witnesses to it, let us hear the Scripture telling us the same truth; “The
full soul,” it is said, “loaths the honey comb, but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is
sweet.”1112 Yet what can be sweeter than honey, and the honey comb? Still he saith it is not
sweet to the man that is not hungry. And what can be more disagreeable than bitter things?
And yet to those who are poverty stricken they are sweet. But that the poor come to the
meal with need and hunger, and that the rich do not wait for this is manifest, I suppose, to
every one. Hence they do not reap the fruit of a genuine and unmixed pleasure. Nor is it
only in the article of food, but any one may perceive that the same thing occurs with respect
to drinks; and as in the one case hunger is the cause of pleasure, far more than the quality
of the viands, so also in the other, thirst usually makes the draught sweetest, although what
<note type="footnote">1111 παῤῥησἴαν, as is said of Timothy, Hom. I. 5. Comp. James v. 16.</note>
<note type="footnote">1112 Prov. xxvii. 7.</note>

<pb n="491"/>
is drunk is only water. And this is that which the prophet intimated, when he said, “He satisfied
them with honey out of the rock.”1113 But we do not read in any part of Scripture that
Moses brought honey out of the rock, but throughout the history we read of rivers, and
waters, and cool streams. What then is it that was meant? For the Scripture by no means
speaks falsely. Inasmuch, then, as they were thirsty and wearied with drought, and found
these streams of water so cooling, in order to show the pleasure of such a draught, he calls
the water honey, not as though its nature were changed into honey, but because the condition
of the drinkers made these streams sweeter than honey. You see how the condition of the
thirsty is wont to make the draught sweet? Yea oftentimes have many of the poor, when
wearied, and distressed, and parched with thirst, partaken of such streams even with such
pleasure as I have said. But the rich, whilst drinking wine that is sweet, and has the fragrance
of flowers,1114 and every perfection that wine can have, experience no such enjoyment.</p>
<p>23. The same thing happens as every one may perceive with regard to sleep. For not a
soft couch, nor a bedstead overlaid with silver, nor the quietness that exists throughout the
house, nor anything else of this kind, are so generally wont to make sleep sweet and pleasant,
as labour and fatigue, and the need of sleep, and drowsiness when one lies down. And to
this particular the experience of facts, nay, before actual experience, the assertion of the
Scriptures bears witness. For Solomon, who had passed his life in luxury, when he wished
to make this matter evident, said, “The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat
little or much?”1115 Why does he add, “whether he eat little or much?” Both these things
usually bring sleeplessness, viz. indigence, and excess of food; the one drying up the body,
stiffening the eyelids and not suffering them to be closed; the other straitening and oppressing
the breath, and inducing many pains. But at the same time so powerful a persuasive is labour,
that though both these things should befall him, the servant is able to sleep. For since
throughout the whole day, they are running about everywhere, ministering to their masters,
being knocked about1116 and hard pressed, and having but little time to take breath, they
receive a sufficient recompense for their toils and labours in the pleasure of sleeping. And
thus it hath happened through the goodness of God toward man, that these pleasures are
not to be purchased with gold and silver, but with labour, with hard toil, with necessity, and
every kind of discipline. Not so the rich. On the contrary, whilst lying on their beds, they
are frequently without sleep through the whole night; and though they devise many schemes,
they do not obtain such pleasure. But the poor man when released from his daily labours,
having his limbs completely tired, falls almost before he can lie down into a slumber that is

<note type="footnote">1116 κοπτόμενοι. Used thus Dem. Ol. 2, as we say “knocked about,” not as Ben., vapulantes.</note>

<pb n="492"/>
sound, and sweet, and genuine, enjoying this reward, which is not a small one, of his fair
day’s toils. Since therefore the poor man sleeps, and drinks, and eats with more pleasure
than the rich man, what further value is left to riches, now deprived of the one advantage
they seemed to have over poverty? For this reason also, from the beginning, God tied the
man to labour, not for the purpose of punishing or chastising, but for amendment and
education. When Adam lived an unlabourious life, he fell from Paradise, but when the
Apostle laboured abundantly, and toiled hard, and said, “In labour and travail, working
night and day,”1117 then he was taken up into Paradise, and ascended to the third heaven!</p>
<p>24. Let us not then despise labour; let us not despise work; for before the kingdom of
Heaven, we receive the greatest recompense from thence, deriving pleasure from that circumstance;
and not pleasure only, but what is greater than pleasure, the purest health. For
in addition to their want of relish, many diseases also attack the rich; but the poor are freed
from the hands of physicians; and if at times they do fall into a sickness, they recover
themselves quickly, being far removed from all effeminacy, and having robust constitutions.
Poverty, to those who bear it wisely, is a great possession, a treasure that cannot be taken
away; the stoutest of staves; a way of gain1118 that cannot be thwarted; a lodging that is safe
from snares. The poor man, it may be objected, is oppressed. But then the rich man is still
more subject to adverse designs. The poor man is looked down upon and insulted. But the
rich man is the subject of envy. The poor man is not so easily assailed as the rich man, offering,
as the latter does on every side, countless handles to the devil, and to his secret foes;
and being the servant of all, on account of the great extent of his business. Standing in need
of many things, he is compelled to flatter many persons, and to minister to them with much
servility. But the poor man, if he knows how to be spiritually wise, is not assailable even by
the devil himself. Job therefore, strong as he was before this, when he lost all, became still
more powerful, and bore away an1119 illustrious victory from the devil!</p>
<p>25. But besides this, the poor man cannot possibly be injured, if he knows how to be
spiritually wise. Now what I said of pleasure, that it consisted not in a costly provision of
meats, but in the disposition of those who eat, this also I say respecting an insult; that the
insult is either created or destroyed, not by the intention of those who insult, but by the
disposition of those who bear it. For example. Some one hath insulted thee with much language,
fit or unfit to repeat. If thou shalt laugh at the insults, if thou take not the words to
heart, if thou showest thyself superior to the blow, thou art not insulted. And just as if we
possessed an adamantine body, we should not be hurt, were we even attacked on all sides
by a thousand darts, for darts beget wounds not from the hand of him who hurls them, but
<note type="footnote">1117 1 Thess. ii. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">1118 κτῆσις.</note>
<note type="footnote">1119 Sav. a more.</note>

<pb n="493"/>
from the bodies of those who receive them, so too in this case, insults are constituted real
and dishonourable ones, not from the folly of those who offer them, but from the weakness
of the insulted. For if we know how to be truly wise, we are incapable of being insulted, or
of suffering any serious evils. Some one it may be hath offered thee an insult, but thou hast
not felt it? thou hast not been pained. Then thou art not insulted, but hast given rather than
received a blow! For when the insulting person perceives that his blow did not reach the
soul of those who were reviled, he is himself the more severely fretted; and whilst those who
are reproached remain silent, the insulting blow is turned backwards, and recoils of its own
accord upon him who aimed it.</p>
<p>26. In all things then, beloved, let us be spiritually wise, and poverty will be able to do
us no harm, but will benefit us exceedingly, and render us more illustrious and wealthy than
the richest. For tell me who was poorer than Elias? Yet for this reason he surpassed all the
wealthy, in that he was so poor, and this very poverty of his was his own choice from an
opulence of mind. For since he accounted the wealth of all riches to be beneath his magnanimity,
and not worthy of his spiritual wisdom, therefore he welcomed this kind of poverty;
so that if he had considered present things as of much worth, he would not have possessed
only a mantle. But so did he contemn the vanity of the life that now is, and regard all gold
as clay cast into the street,1120 that he possessed himself of nothing more than that covering.
Therefore the king had need of the poor man, and he who had so much gold hung upon
the words of him who had nothing more than a sheepskin. Thus was the sheepskin1121 more
splendid than the purple, and the cave of the just man than the halls of kings. Therefore also
when he went up to heaven, he left nothing to his disciple save the sheepskin. “By the help
of this,” said he, “I have wrestled with the devil, and taking this, be thou armed against him!”
For indigence is a powerful weapon, an unassailable retreat, an unshaken fortress! Elisha
received the sheepskin as the greatest inheritance; for it was truly such; a more precious one
than all gold. And thenceforth1122 that Elias was a twofold person; an Elias above and an
Elias below! I know ye account that just person blessed, and ye would each desire to be that
person. What then if I show you that all among us, who are initiated,1123 have received
something far greater than he did? For Elias left a sheepskin to his disciple, but the Son of
God ascending left to us His own flesh! Elias indeed, cast off his mantle, before he went up;

but Christ left it behind for our sakes; and yet retained it when He ascended. Let us not then
be cast down. Let us not lament, nor fear the difficulty of the times, for He who did not refuse

having learnt that “the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep,”1126 he took his
departure; venturing his own life for us all, notwithstanding there were many things to
hinder his absence, and enforce his stay. And first, his time of life, extended as it is to the
utmost limits of old age; next, his bodily infirmity, and the season of the year, as well as the
necessity for his presence at the holy festival; and besides these reasons, his only sister even
now at her last breath! He has disregarded, however, the ties of kindred, of old age, of infirmity,
and the severity of the season, and the toils of the journey; and preferring you and your
safety above all things, he has broken through all these restraints. And, even as a youth, the
aged man is now hastening along, borne upon the wings of zeal! For if Christ (saith he) gave
Himself for us, what excuse or pardon should we deserve, having undertaken the charge of
so numerous a people, if we were not ready to do and to suffer anything for the security of
those committed into our hands. For if (continues he) the patriarch Jacob, when in charge

nights, and bore heat and cold, and all the inclemency of the elements, to the end that not
one of those animals might perish, much less doth it become us, who preside over those,
who are not irrational, but spiritual sheep; who are about to give an account of this charge,
not to man, but to God, to be slack in any respect, or shrink from anything which might
benefit the flock. Besides, in proportion as the latter flock is superior to the former; men to
brutes, and God to men; so it behoves us to manifest a greater and more intense anxiety and
diligence. He knows well that his concern is now, not for one city only, but for the whole
of the East. For our city is the head and mother of all that lie towards the East. For this
reason he would encounter every danger, and nothing would avail to detain him here.</p>
<p>2. On this account I trust that there may be a good hope; for God will not disdain to
look upon such earnestness and zeal, nor will He suffer his servant to return without success.
I know that when he has barely seen our pious Emperor, and been seen by him, he will be
able at once by his very countenance to allay his wrath. For not only the words of the saints,
but their very countenances are full of grace. And he is a person too endowed with abundant
wisdom; and being well skilled in the divine laws, he will say to him as Moses said to God,
“Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin;—and if not, slay me together with them.”1127 For
such are the bowels of the saints, that they think death with their children sweeter than life
without them. He will also make the special season his advocate and shelter himself behind
the sacred festival of the Passover; and will remind the Emperor of the season when Christ
remitted the sins of the whole world. He will exhort him to imitate his Lord. He will also
remind him of that parable of the ten thousand talents, and the hundred pence. I know the
boldness of our father, that he will not hesitate to alarm him from the parable, and to say,
“Take heed lest thou also hear it said in that day, ‘O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all
that debt, because thou desirest me; you ought also to forgive thy fellow-servants!’1128 Thou
dost to thyself a greater benefit than them, since by pardoning these few offences thou
gainest an amnesty for greater.” To this address he will add that prayer, which those who
initiated him into the sacred mystery taught him to offer up, and say, “Forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors.”1129</p>
<p>3. He will moreover inform him, that the offence was not common to the whole city,
but the deed of certain strangers and adventurers, men that act upon no deliberate plan, but
with every sort of audacity and lawlessness; and that it would not be just for the disorderly

conduct of a few to extirpate so great a city, and to punish those who had done no wrong;
and that even though all had been transgressors, they had paid a sufficient punishment,
being consumed by fear so many days, and expecting every day to be put to death, and being
exiles and fugitives; thus living more wretchedly than condemned criminals, carrying their
life in their hands, and having no confidence of escape! “Let this punishment (he will say)
suffice. Carry not thy resentment further! Make the Judge above merciful to thyself, by humanity
towards thy fellow-servants! Think of the greatness of the city, and that the question
now is not concerning one, or two, or three, or ten souls, but of a vast multitude too numerous
to be reckoned up! It is a question which affects the capital of the whole world. This is
the city in which Christians were first called by that name.1130 Honor Christ. Reverence the
city which first proclaimed that name, so lovely and sweet to all! This city hath been the
tabernacle of Apostles; the dwelling place of the just! And now this is the first and only instance
of insurrection against its rulers; and all past time will bear favourable witness to the
manners of the city. For had the people been continually given to sedition, it might have
been necessary to make an example of such iniquity; but if this hath happened only once in
all time, it is plain that the offence has not arisen from the habit of the city, but that it was
the transgression of those who had in an evil hour by mere random chance arrived there.”</p>
<p>4. These things and more than these the priest will say with still greater boldness; and
the Emperor will listen to them; and one is humane, and the other is faithful; so that on both
sides we entertain favourable hopes. But much more do we rely upon the mercy of God,
than upon the fidelity of our Teacher and the humanity of the Emperor. For whilst the
Emperor is supplicated, and the priest is supplicating, He Himself will interpose, softening
the heart of the Emperor, and exciting the tongue of the priest; facilitating his utterance;—preparing
the mind of the other to receive what is said and with much indulgence, to accede
to the petitions. For our city is dearer to Christ than all others both because of the virtue of
our ancestors, and of your own. And as Peter was the first among the apostles to preach
Christ, so as I said before, this city was the first of cities that adorned itself by assuming the
Christian appellation, as a sort of admirable diadem. But if where only ten just men were
found, God promised to save all who dwelt therein, why should we not expect a favourable
issue, and become assured of all our lives, when there are not only ten, twenty, or twice so
many only, but far more; who are serving God with all strictness.</p>
<p>5. I have heard many saying, “The threats of a king are like the wrath of a lion;”1131 being
full of dejection and lamentation. What then should we say to such? That He who said, “The
wolves and the lambs shall feed together; and the leopard shall lie down with the kid, and

the lion shall eat straw like the ox,”1132 will be able to convert the lion into a mild lamb. Let
us therefore supplicate Him; let us send an embassy to Him; and He will doubtless allay the
Emperor’s wrath, and deliver us from the impending distress. Our Father hath gone thither
on this embassy. Let us go on embassy from hence to the Majesty of heaven! Let us assist
him by prayers! The community of the Church can do much, if with a sorrowful soul, and
with a contrite spirit, we offer up our prayers! It is unnecessary to cross the ocean, or to
undertake a long journey. Let every man and woman among us, whether meeting together
at church, or remaining at home, call upon God with much earnestness, and He will
doubtless accede to these petitions.</p>
<p>Whence does this appear evident? Because He is exceedingly desirous, that we should
always take refuge in Him, and in everything make our requests unto Him; and do nothing
and speak nothing without Him. For men, when we trouble them repeatedly concerning
our affairs, become slothful and evasive, and conduct themselves unpleasantly towards us;
but with God it is quite the reverse. Not when we apply to him continually respecting our
affairs, but when we fail to do so, then is he especially displeased. Hear at least what He reproves
the Jews for, when He says, “Ye have taken counsel, but not of Me, and made treaties,
1133 but not by My Spirit.”1134 For this is the custom of those who love; they desire that
all the concerns of their beloved should be accomplished by means of themselves; and that
they should neither do anything, nor say anything, without them. On this account did God
not only on that occasion, but again elsewhere, uttering a reproof, speak the same language.
“They1135 have reigned, but not by Me; they have ruled, and they made it not known to
Me.”1136 Let us not then be slow to take refuge in Him continually; and whatever be the
evil, it will in any case find its appropriate solution.</p>
<p>6. Doth a man affright you? Hasten to the Lord above, and thou wilt suffer no evil. Thus
the ancients had release from their calamities; and not men only, but also women. There
was a certain Hebrew woman, Esther was her name. This Esther rescued the whole people
of the Jews, when they were about to be delivered over to destruction, by this very method.
For when the Persian king gave orders that all the Jews should be utterly destroyed, and
there was no one who was able to stand in the way of his wrath,—this woman having divested

herself of the splendid robe, and clothed herself with sackcloth and being besprinkled with
ashes, supplicated the merciful God to go in with her to the king; and offering up her prayer
to Him, these were the words she uttered, “O Lord, make my words acceptable,1137 and put
eloquent speech in my mouth.”1138 Let this be the prayer which we offer to God for our
Teacher. For if a woman, supplicating on behalf of the Jews, prevailed to allay the wrath of
a barbarian, much rather will our Teacher, entreating on behalf of so great a city, and in
conjunction with so great a Church, be able to persuade this most mild and merciful Emperor.
For if he hath received authority to loose sins committed against God, much more will he
be able to take away and blot out those which have been committed against a man. He is
also himself a ruler and a ruler of more dignity than the other. For the sacred laws take and
place under his hands even the royal head. And when there is need of any good thing from
above, the Emperor is accustomed to fly to the priest: but not the priest to the Emperor.
He1139 too hath his breast-plate, that of righteousness.1140 He too hath his girdle, that of
truth, and sandals1141 of much greater dignity, those of the Gospel of peace. He too hath a
sword, not of iron, but of the Spirit; he too hath a crown resting on his head. This panoply
is the more splendid. The weapons are grander, the license of speech greater,1142 and
mightier1143 the strength. So that from the weight of his authority, and from his own
greatness of soul; and more than all the rest, from the hope which he has in God, he will
address the Emperor with much freedom and much discretion.</p>
<p>7. Let us not then despair of our safety, but let us pray; let us make invocation; let us
supplicate; let us go on embassy to the King that is above with many tears! We have this fast
too as an ally, and as an assistant in this good intercession. Therefore, as when the winter
is over and the summer is appearing, the sailor draws his vessel to the deep; and the soldier

burnishes his arms, and makes ready his steed for the battle; and the husbandman sharpens
his sickle; and the traveller boldly undertakes a long journey, and the wrestler strips and
bares himself for the contest. So too, when the fast makes its appearance, like a kind of
spiritual summer, let us as soldiers burnish our weapons; and as husbandmen let us sharpen
our sickle; and as sailors let us order our thoughts against the waves of extravagant desires;
and as travellers let us set out on the journey towards heaven; and as wrestlers let us strip
for the contest. For the believer is at once a husbandman, and a sailor, and a soldier, a
wrestler, and a traveller. Hence St. Paul saith, “We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
against principalities, against powers. Put on therefore the whole armour of God.”1144 Hast
thou observed the wrestler? Hast thou observed the soldier? If thou art a wrestler, it is necessary
for thee to engage in the conflict naked. If a soldier, it behoves thee to stand in the battle
line armed at all points. How then are both these things possible, to be naked, and yet not
naked; to be clothed, and yet not clothed! How? I will tell thee. Divest thyself of worldly
business, and thou hast become a wrestler. Put on the spiritual armour, and thou hast become
a soldier. Strip thyself of worldly cares, for the season is one of wrestling. Clothe thyself with
the spiritual armour, for we have a heavy warfare to wage with demons. Therefore also it is
needful we should be naked, so as to offer nothing that the devil may take hold of, while he
is wrestling with us; and to be fully armed at all points, so as on no side to receive a deadly
blow. Cultivate thy soul. Cut away the thorns. Sow the word of godliness. Propagate and
nurse with much care the fair plants of divine wisdom, and thou hast become a husbandman.
And Paul will say to thee, “The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the
fruits.”1145 He too himself practised this art. Therefore writing to the Corinthians, he said,
“I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.”1146 Sharpen thy sickle, which
thou hast blunted through gluttony—sharpen it by fasting. Lay hold of the pathway which
leads towards heaven; rugged and narrow as it is, lay hold of it, and journey on. And how
mayest thou be able to do these things? By subduing thy body, and bringing it into subjection.
For when the way grows narrow, the corpulence that comes of gluttony is a great hindrance.
Keep down the waves of inordinate desires. Repel the tempest of evil thoughts. Preserve the
bark; display much skill, and thou hast become a pilot. But we shall have the fast for a
groundwork and instructor in all these things.</p>
<p>8. I speak not, indeed, of such a fast as most persons keep, but of real fasting; not merely
an abstinence from meats; but from sins too. For the nature of a fast is such, that it does not

suffice to deliver those who practise it, unless it be done according to a suitable law.1147
“For the wrestler,” it is said, “is not crowned unless he strive lawfully.”1148 To the end then,
that when we have gone through the labour of fasting, we forfeit not the crown of fasting,
we should understand how, and after what manner, it is necessary to conduct this business;
since that Pharisee also fasted,1149 but afterwards went down empty, and destitute of the
fruit of fasting. The Publican fasted not; and yet he was accepted in preference to him who
had fasted; in order that thou mayest learn that fasting is unprofitable, except all other duties
follow with it. The Ninevites fasted, and won the favour of God.1150 The Jews, fasted too,
and profited nothing, nay, they departed with blame.1151 Since then the danger in fasting
is so great to those who do not know how they ought to fast, we should learn the laws of
this exercise, in order that we may not “run uncertainly,” nor “beat the air,” nor while we
are fighting contend with a shadow. Fasting is a medicine; but a medicine, though it be
never so profitable, becomes frequently useless owing to the unskilfulness of him who employs
it. For it is necessary to know, moreover, the time when it should be applied, and the
requisite quantity of it; and the temperament of body that admits it; and the nature of the
country, and the season of the year; and the corresponding diet; as well as various other
particulars; any of which, if one overlooks, he will mar all the rest that have been named.
Now if, when the body needs healing, such exactness is required on our part, much more
ought we, when our care is about the soul, and we seek to heal the distempers of the mind,
to look, and to search into every particular with the utmost accuracy.</p>
<p>9. Let us see then how the Ninevites fasted, and how they were delivered from that
wrath—“Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste anything,”1152 saith (the prophet).
What sayest thou? Tell me—must even the irrational things fast, and the horses and the
mules be covered with sackcloth? “Even so,” he replies. For as when, at the decease of some
rich man, the relatives clothe not only the men servants and maid servants, but the horses
also with sackcloth, and give orders that they should follow the procession to the sepulchre,
led by their grooms; thus signifying the greatness of the calamity, and inviting all to pity;
thus also, indeed, when that city was about to be destroyed, even the irrational nature was

enveloped in sackcloth, and subjected to the yoke of fasting. “It is not possible,” saith he,
“that irrational creatures should learn the wrath of God by means of reason; let them be
taught by means of fasting, that this stroke is of divine infliction. For if the city should be
overturned, not only would it be one common sepulchre for us, the dwellers therein, but
for these likewise. Inasmuch then as these would participate in the punishment, let them
also do so in the fast.” But there was yet another thing which they aimed at in this act, which
the prophets also are wont to do. For these, when they see some dreadful chastisement
proceeding from heaven, and those who are to be punished without anything to say for
themselves;—laden with shame,—unworthy of the least pardon or excuse:—not knowing
what to do, nor from whence they may procure an advocacy for the condemned, they have
recourse to the things irrational; and describing their death in tragical fashion, they make
intercession by them, putting forward as a plea their pitiable and mournful destruction.
When therefore, aforetime, famine had seized upon the Jews, and a great drought oppressed
their country, and all things were being consumed, one of the prophets spoke thus, “The
young heifers leaped in their stalls; the herds of oxen wept, because there was no pasture;
all the cattle of the field looked upward to Thee, because the streams of waters were dried
up.”1153 Another prophet bewailing the evils of drought again speaks to this effect: “The
hinds calved in the fields and forsook it, because there was no grass. The wild asses did stand
in the forests; they snuffed up the wind like a dragon; their eyes did fail, because there was
no grass.”1154 Moreover, ye have heard Joel saying to-day, “Let the bridegroom go forth of
his chamber, and the bride out of her closet;—the infants that suck the breast.”1155 For what
reason, I ask, does he call so immature an age to supplication? Is it not plainly for the very
same reason? For since all who have arrived at the age of manhood, have inflamed and
provoked God’s wrath, let the age, saith he, which is devoid of transgressions supplicate
Him who is provoked.</p>
<p>10. But, as I said before, we may see what it was that dissolved such inexorable wrath.
Was it, forsooth, fasting only and sackcloth? We say not so; but the change of their whole
life. Whence does this appear? From the very language of the prophet. For he who hath
discoursed of the wrath of God, and of their fasting,1156 himself too, when speaking of the

reconciliation, and teaching us the cause of the reconciliation, speaks to this effect; “And
God saw their works.”1157 What kind of works? That they had fasted? That they had put on
sackcloth? Nothing of the sort: but passing all these points in silence, he adds, “That they
turned every one from their evil ways, and the Lord repented of the evil that He had said
He would do unto them.” Seest thou, that fasting did not rescue from this danger, but it was
the change of life, which rendered God propitious and kind to these barbarians?</p>
<p>11. I have said these things, not that we may disparage fasting, but that we may honour
fasting; for the honour of fasting consists not in abstinence from food, but in withdrawing
from sinful practices; since he who limits his fasting only to an abstinence from meats, is
one who especially disparages it. Dost thou fast? Give me proof of it by thy works! Is it said
by what kind of works? If thou seest a poor man, take pity on him! If thou seest in enemy,
be reconciled to him! If thou seest a friend gaining honour, envy him not! If thou seest a
handsome woman, pass her by! For let not the mouth only fast, but also the eye, and the
ear, and the feet, and the hands, and all the members of our bodies. Let the hands fast, by
being pure from rapine and avarice. Let the feet fast, by ceasing from running to the unlawful
spectacles. Let the eyes fast, being taught never1158 to fix themselves rudely upon handsome
countenances, or to busy themselves with strange beauties. For looking is the food of the
eyes, but if this be such as is unlawful or forbidden, it mars the fast; and upsets the whole
safety of the soul; but if it be lawful and safe, it adorns fasting. For it would be among things
the most absurd to abstain from lawful food because of the fast, but with the eyes to touch
even what is forbidden. Dost thou not eat flesh? Feed not upon lasciviousness by means of
the eyes. Let the ear fast also. The fasting of the ear consists in refusing to receive evil
speakings and calumnies. “Thou shalt not receive a false report,”1159 it says.</p>
<p>12. Let the mouth too fast from disgraceful speeches and railing. For what doth it profit
if we abstain from birds and fishes;1160 and yet bite and devour our brethren? The evil
speaker eateth the flesh of his brother, and biteth the body of his neighbour. Because of this
Paul utters the fearful saying, “If ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not
consumed one of another.”1161 Thou hast not fixed thy teeth in the flesh, but thou hast fixed
the slander in the soul, and inflicted the wound of evil suspicion; thou hast harmed, in a

thousand ways, thyself and him, and many others, for in slandering a neighbour thou hast
made him who listens to the slander worse;1162 for should he be a wicked man, he becomes
more careless when he finds a partner in his wickedness; and should he be a just man, he is
lifted to arrogance, and puffed up; being led on by the sin of others to imagine great things
concerning himself. Besides,1163 thou hast struck at the common welfare of the Church; for
all those who hear not only accuse the supposed sinner, but the reproach is fastened on the
Christian community; neither dost thou hear the unbelievers saying, “Such a person is a
fornicator, or a libertine;” but instead of the individual who hath sinned, they accuse all
Christians. In addition to this,1164 thou hast caused the glory of God to be blasphemed; for
as His Name is glorified when we have good report, so when we sin, it is blasphemed and
insulted!</p>
<p>13. A fourth reason is, that thou hast disgraced him who is ill reported; and hast thus
rendered him more shameless than he was, by placing him in a state of enmity and hostility.
Fifthly, thou hast made thyself liable to chastisement and vengeance; by involving1165 thyself
in matters which in no way concerned thee. For let not any one tell me in reply, “Then I am
an evil speaker when I speak falsely, but if I speak what is true, I cease to be so.” Although
it be with truth thou speakest evil, this also is a crime. For that Pharisee spake evil of the
Publican with truth; but nevertheless this availed him not. For was not the latter, I ask, a
publican and a sinner? It is manifest to every one that he was a publican. But at the same
time inasmuch as the Pharisee spoke ill of him, he departed from the temple with the loss
of every advantage. Dost thou wish to correct a brother? Weep; pray unto God; taking him
apart, admonish, counsel, entreat him! So also Paul did, “Lest,” saith he, “when I come again,
my God will humble me among you, and I shall bewail many which have sinned already,

care and anxiety for his welfare, and not from a wish to expose him, that thou puttest him
in mind of his sin. Take hold of his feet; embrace him; be not ashamed, if thou truly desirest
to cure him. Physicians too do things of this sort, oftentimes, when their patients are hard

<p>14. But not only do I now admonish the evil speakers; but those besides, who hear others
ill spoken of, I exhort to stop up their ears, and to imitate the prophet who saith, “Whoso
privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I punish.”1169 Say to thy neighbour, “Hast thou
any one to praise or highly to commend? I open my ears, to receive the fragrant oil; but if
thou hast any evil to say, I block up the entrance to thy words,—for I am not to admit dung
and dirt. What profit doth it afford me to learn that such a one is a bad man? The greatest
injury indeed results from this, and the worst loss!” Say to him, “Let us be anxious about
our own faults; how we may render up an account of our own transgressions; and exhibit
this sort of curiosity and meddlesome activity respecting our own lives. What excuse or
pardon shall we find; whilst we never even take into consideration our own affairs, but thus
inquisitively pry into those of others!” And as it is mean and extremely disgraceful to peer
into a house, and to observe what is within as one passes, so also to make inquisition into
another man’s life is the last degree of illiberality. But what is yet more ridiculous is, that
those who lead this sort of life, and are neglectful of their own affairs, when they have
mentioned any of these secret matters, beseech and adjure him who has heard it, not to
mention it more to any other person; thus making it plain that they have done an action
which deserves censure. For if thou beseechest him to tell this to no other person, much
more did it not become thee to tell these things first to him. The matter was safe while in
thy possession; now, after betraying it, thou art grown anxious for its safety. If thou art desirous
that it be not carried abroad to another,1170 do not thyself tell it. But when thou hast
betrayed the custody of the matter to another, thou doest what is superfluous and useless,
in charging him, and putting him on oath for the safety of what has been spoken.</p>
<p>15. “But it is sweet to slander.” Nay, it is sweet not to speak evil. For he that hath spoken
evil is henceforth contentious; he is suspicious and he fears, repents, and gnaws his own
tongue. Being timorous and trembling, lest at any time, what he said should be carried to
others, and bring great peril, and useless and needless enmity, on the sayer. But he who
keeps the matter to himself, will spend his days in safety, with much pleasantness. “Thou

one’s own sins privately. St. Chrysostom certainly did not regard this as necessary. The original practice was a
public confession of crimes. Private confession was at first subservient to this. See Bingham, b. xv. c. 8, sec. 6;

hast heard a word,” we read, “let it die with thee; and be bold; it will1171 not burst thee.”1172
What is the meaning of this? “let it die with thee?” Extinguish it; bury it; neither permit it
to go forth, nor even to move at all; but, as the best course, be careful not to tolerate others
in the practice of evil speaking. And should you perchance, at any time receive an impression
from it, bury it, destroy what has been uttered, deliver it over to oblivion; in order that you
may become like those who have not heard it; and spend the present life with much peace
and security. Should the slanderers learn that we abhor them more than those do whom
they accuse, they themselves will henceforth abandon this evil habit, and correct the sin;
and will afterwards applaud, and proclaim us as those who were their saviours and benefactors.
For, as to speak well, and to applaud, is the beginning of friendship, so to speak ill and
to calumniate, has been the beginning and foundation of enmity, and hatred, and a thousand
quarrels. From nothing else have our own affairs been more neglected, than from the habit
of prying into and meddling with the concerns of others; for it is not possible for one who
is given to evil speaking, and busying himself with other men’s lives, ever to look after his
own life. His whole study being expended upon meddling with other men’s matters, all
those which belong to himself must of necessity be left at hazard and neglected. For it is
well if one who spends all his leisure on the anxious consideration of his own sins, and the
judgment of them, can make any progress. But when thou art always busy about other men’s
matters, when wilt thou pay any heed to thy own evils?</p>
<p>16. Let us flee then, beloved, let us flee slander! knowing that it is the very gulph of Satan,
and the place where he lurks with his snares. For in order that we may be careless of our
own state, and may thus render our account heavier, the devil leads us into this custom. But
more than this it is not only a very serious matter, that we shall hereafter have to give account
of what we have spoken, but that we shall make our own offences the heavier by these means;
depriving ourselves of all excuse. For he who scans with bitterness the conduct of others,
can never obtain pardon for the sins committed by himself. For God will determine the
sentence, not only from the nature of our transgressions, but from the judgment which thou
hast passed upon others. Therefore He gave the admonition, “Judge not, that ye be not
judged.”1173 For the sin, of whatever kind, will not there appear any more such as it was
when committed, but will receive a great and unpardonable addition from the judgment
passed by thee upon thy fellow servants. For as he who is humane, and merciful, and forgiving,
cuts away the greater mass of his sins, so he who is bitter, and cruel, and implacable,
greatly increases the magnitude of his own offences. Let us then expel from our mouth all

slander, knowing that if we do not abstain from it, though we might feed upon ashes, this
austerity would avail us nothing. “For not that which entereth into, but that which cometh
out of the mouth defileth the man.”1174 If any one were to stir up a cesspool, when you were
passing, say, would you not reproach and rate the man who did it? This then also do with
respect to the slanderer. For the stirred cesspool does not so grossly offend the sense of those
who smell that ill savour, as the stirring up other men’s sins, and the exposure of an impure
life, offends and disturbs the soul of those who hear of it. Therefore let us abstain from evil
speaking, from foul language, from blasphemy; and let us not speak ill of our neighbour,
nor of God!</p>
<p>17. For many of our evil speakers have run into such madness, as to lift up their own
tongue from their fellow servants against their Master. But how great an evil this is, you
may learn from the affairs in which we are now involved. A man is insulted, and, lo! we are
all fearing and trembling, both those who were guilty of the insult, and those who are conscious
of nothing of the kind! But God is insulted every day! Why do I say every day?—every
hour rather, by the rich, by the poor, by those who are at ease, by the afflicted, by those who
calumniate, and those who are calumniated, and yet no one ever hears a word of this!
Therefore He has permitted our fellow servant1175 to be insulted, in order that from the
danger which has happened through this insult, thou mayest learn the benignity of the Lord!
And notwithstanding that this is our first and only offence, we do not on that account expect
to gain an excuse, or pardon. But we provoke God every day, and we show no signs of returning
to Him, and yet He endures it with all long-suffering! Seest thou then how great the
benignity of the Lord is? Yet, in this present outrage, those who had done amiss were taken
and thrust into prison, and paid the penalty; nevertheless we are still in fear, for he who has
been insulted has not as yet heard1176 what has taken place, nor pronounced sentence, and
we are all trembling. But God every day hears of the insults offered Him, and no one heeds
it, although God is thus merciful and loving toward man. With Him it suffices only to acknowledge
the sin, and so to cancel the accusation. But with man it is altogether the reverse.
When those who have sinned confess, then they are punished the more; which indeed has
happened in the present instance. And some have perished by the sword, some by fire; some
given to wild beasts, and not men only, but children. And neither this immaturity of age,
nor the tumult of the people, nor the circumstance that they were infuriated by demons
when they perpetrated these deeds;1177 nor that the exaction was thought to be intoler-

able;1178 nor poverty, nor having offended in company with all; nor promising that they
would never hereafter dare to repeat such deeds; nor anything else, could at all rescue them;
but they were led away to the pit,1179 without reprieve; armed soldiers conducting and
guarding them on either side, lest any one should carry off the criminals; whilst mothers
also followed afar off, seeing their children beheaded, but not daring to bewail their calamity;
for terror conquered grief, and fear overcame nature! And just as when men beholding from
the land those who are shipwrecked, are deeply distressed, but are not able to approach and
to rescue the drowning, so too here, the mothers restrained through fear of the soldiers, as
it were by so many waves, not only dared not go near to their children, and rescue them
from condemnation, but were afraid even to shed tears?</p>
<p>18. Assuredly ye gather from thence the mercy of God, how unspeakable, how boundless,
how transcending all description! Here indeed the person who has been insulted is of the
same nature;1180 and only once in all his lifetime has experienced this; and then it was not
done to his face; nor while he was present to see or hear it; and nevertheless, none of those
who perpetrated these deeds obtained pardon. But with regard to God nothing of the kind
can be said; for the interval between man and God, is so great, as no language can at all express;
and throughout every day He is insulted, although present, and seeing and hearing
it: and yet He sends not forth the lightning, nor commands the sea to overflow the land,
and submerge all men; nor does He bid the earth to cleave asunder and swallow up all the
contumelious; but He forbears, and suffers long, and still offers to pardon those who have
insulted Him, if they only repent and promise to do these things no more! Truly now is the
season to proclaim, “Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? who can show forth all His
praise?”1181 How many men have not only cast down, but also trodden under foot the images
of God! For when thou throttlest a debtor, when thou strippest him, when thou draggest
him away,1182 thou tramplest under foot God’s image. Hear for a certainty Paul saying, that
“a man ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God.”1183

And again, hear God Himself saying, “Let us make man in Our Image, after Our likeness.”1184
But if thou sayest that man is not of the same substance as God,—what matters that? For
neither was the brazen statue of the same substance as the Emperor; yet nevertheless, they
who defied it paid the penalty. Thus also with regard to mankind, if men are not of the same
substance as God, (as indeed they are not), still they have been called His image; and it were
fitting they should receive honour on account of the appellation. But thou for the sake of a
little gold dost trample them under foot, dost throttle them, and drag them away; and hast
not to this day in any wise paid the penalty!</p>
<p>19. May there be then speedily some favourable and propitious change! This certainly
I foretell and testify, that although this cloud should pass away, and we yet remain in the
same condition of listlessness, we shall again have to suffer much heavier evils than those
we are now dreading; for I do not so much fear the wrath of the Emperor, as your own listlessness.
Surely it is not sufficient by way of apology that we supplicate1185 two or three
days, but it is necessary that we should make a change in our whole life,1186 and that whilst
abstaining from wickedness we should persevere continually in virtue. For as those who are
sickly, unless they keep up a constant regimen, would find no advantage by their observing
a two or three days’ discipline; so those who are in sin, if they do not exercise sobriety at all
times, will find no benefit in two or three days’ amendment. For as it is said, that he who is
washed, and is again afterwards polluted with the mire, hath gained nothing; so he who has
repented for three days, and has again returned to his former state, has accomplished
nothing. Let us not therefore, now act as we have always done hitherto. For many times,
when we have been surprised by earthquakes, as well as famine and drought, after becoming
more sober and gentle for three or four days, we did but return again to the former course.
For this cause our present troubles have happened. But if we have not done so before; yet,
now at least let us all persevere in the same piety; let us preserve the same meekness, that
we may not again need another stroke. Was not God able to have prevented what has taken
place? He did, however, permit it, that He might make those who despised Him more soberminded,
through dread of a fellow-servant!</p>
<p>20. But let not any one say that many of the guilty escaped, and that many of the innocent
incurred punishment. For I hear of numerous persons who frequently say this; not only in
the case of the present sedition, but also in many other circumstances of this nature. What
then should I reply to those who make such observations? Why, that if he who was captured
was innocent of the present sedition, he had wrought some other transgression before this
still more grievous, for which, not having afterwards repented, he has paid the penalty at
<note type="footnote">1184 Gen. i. 26.</note>

<note type="footnote">1186 Sav. and M. “the change that of our whole life:” the Greek reads best so.</note>

<pb n="510"/>
the present time. For thus is the custom of God to deal with us. When we sin, He does not
straightway visit the transgression, but lets it pass, giving us space1187 for repentance, in
order that we may be amended and converted. But if, because we have not paid the penalty,
we suppose that the offence too is blotted out, and make light of it; then somewhere, where
we think not of it, we are sure afterwards to be punished. And this takes place in order that,
when we sin and are not punished, we may not be free from fear, unless we amend, knowing
that we shall certainly fall into punishment where we do not expect it. So that if thou sinnest,
beloved, and art not punished, do not grow presumptuous, but for this very cause be the
more alarmed, knowing that it is an easy matter with God to recompense again when he
pleases. For this reason then he hath not punished thee, that thou mightest receive space
for repentance. Let us not therefore say, that such a person whilst innocent incurred punishment;
and another whilst guilty escaped, for he who incurred it, being guiltless, as I observed,
paid the punishment of other transgressions; and he who now escapes it, if he repents not,
will be captured in another snare. If our minds are thus disposed, we shall never forget our
own sins, but, always fearful and trembling lest we should have to pay the penalty, we shall
readily recollect them. For nothing is so apt to bring sin to remembrance as punishment
and chastisement. And this is shown by Joseph’s brethren. For when they had sold the just
man, and thirteen years had passed away, suspecting they had fallen into punishment, and
fearing for their lives, they remembered their sin, and said one to another, “We are verily
guilty concerning our brother Joseph.”1188 Seest thou, how fear brought their guilt to recollection?
And yet when they were sinning they perceived it not, but when they were fearful
of being punished, then they remembered it? Knowing, therefore, all these things, let us
make a change and amendment of our lives; and let us think of religion and virtue, before
we think of deliverance from the impending distress.</p>
<p>21. And in the meanwhile I desire to fix three precepts in your mind, to the end that
you may accomplish me these during the fast,—viz. to speak ill of no one; to hold no one
for an enemy; and to expel from the mouth altogether the evil custom of oaths. And as when
we hear that some money tax is imposed, each one going within, and calling his wife and
children and servants, considers and consults with them how he may pay this tribute, so
also let us do with respect to these spiritual precepts. Let every one when he has returned
home call together his wife and children, and let him say, that a spiritual tribute was imposed
this day: a tribute by which there will be some deliverance and removal of these evils; a
tribute which does not make those who pay it poor, but richer; that is to say, to have no
enemy, to speak evil of no man, and to swear not at all. Let us consider; let us think; let us
resolve how we may fulfill these precepts. Let us exert every endeavour. Let us admonish
<note type="footnote">1187 προθεσμίαν.</note>
<note type="footnote">1188 Gen. xlii. 21.</note>

<pb n="511"/>
each other. Let us correct each other, that we may not go to the other world as debtors, and
then, needing to borrow of others, suffer the fate of the foolish virgins, and fall from immortal
salvation. If we thus set our lives in order, I warrant you and promise, that from this there
will be deliverance from the present calamity, and a removal of these dreadful ills; and what
is greater than all, there will be the enjoyment of the good things to come. For it were fitting
that I should commit to you the whole body of virtue; but I think it the best method of correction,
to take the laws by parts, and reduce them to practice, and then to proceed to others.
For as in a given field, the husbandman, digging it all up piecemeal, gradually comes to the
end of his task; so we too if we make this rule for ourselves, in any wise to reduce to a correct
practice these three precepts during the present Lent, and to commit them to the safe custody
of good habit, we shall proceed with greater ease to the rest; and by this means arriving at
the summit of spiritual wisdom, we shall both reap the fruit of a favourable hope in the
present life; and in the life to come we shall stand before Christ with great confidence, and
enjoy those unspeakable blessings; which, God grant, we may all be found worthy of, through
the grace and loving kindness of Jesus Christ our Lord, with Whom be glory to the Father
and the Holy Spirit forever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily IV.</head>
<p>An exhortation to the people respecting fortitude and patience, from the examples of Job and
the Three Children in Babylon. The Homily concludes with an address on the subject of
abstaining from oaths.</p>
<p>1. Blessed be God! who hath comforted your sorrowing souls, and stayed your agitated
spirits! For that ye have received no small consolation is evident by the desire and readiness
to listen which ye are now showing. For it is impossible that a soul in anguish, and oppressed
with the cloud of despondency, should have power to hear with readiness anything that is
spoken. But I see you are attending to us with much good will, and with an intense earnestness;
and that you have shaken off gloomy thoughts, and put aside the sense of present distress,
in your affectionate desire of listening. For this cause, I thank God heartily together
with you, that the calamity has not overmatched your philosophy; nor fear relaxed your
vigour; nor tribulation quenched your alacrity; nor danger dried up your zeal: nor the fear
of men overcome the desire for God; nor the difficulty of the times overthrown your earnestness;
nay, so far from overthrowing, it has strengthened it; so far from slackening, it has
given it more intensity; so far from quenching, has kindled it the more. The forum is indeed
empty, but the church is filled; the former supplies material for melancholy, the latter is an
occasion of joy and spiritual gladness! When therefore, beloved, you betake yourself to the
forum, and the sight of the solitude calls forth a groan, fly back to thy Mother, and
straightway she will console thee with the multitude of her offspring and will show thee the
chorus of the Brethren complete, and will drive away all thy despondency! For in the city
we are as earnestly longing to see human beings, as those who inhabit the deserts; but when
we take refuge in the church, we are straitened for room by the multitude. And as when the
sea is in uproar, and rendered furious by the violent tempest, fear compels all to fly for refuge
from without into the harbour; so also now, the waves of the forum, and the tempest of the
city, drives together every one from all sides into the church, and by the bond of love knits
the members close to one another.</p>
<p>2. Let us then give thanks to God even for these things, that we have reaped so much
fruit from the tribulation; that we have received so great an advantage from the trial. If there
were no trial, there would be no crown; if there were no wrestlings, there would be no prize;
if there were no lists1189 marked out, there would be no honours; if there were no tribulation,

there would be no rest; if there were no winter, there would be no summer. And this may
be observed, not only amongst men, but even with the very seeds; for if, in that case, we
expect the ear of corn to spring and flourish, there must be much rain, much gathering of
the clouds, and much frost; and the time of sowing is also a rainy season. Since therefore
the winter, a winter not of the elements, but of souls, has now set in, let us too sow in this
winter that we may reap in the summer; let us sow tears, that we may reap gladness. This is
not my word, it is a prophetic promise, “They who sow in tears, shall reap in joy.”1190 The
rain which cometh down, doth not so make the seeds to sprout and grow, as the shower of
falling tears maketh the seed of godliness to spring up and flourish. This it is that cleanseth
the soul; watereth the mind, and causeth the growing germ of doctrine to push rapidly forwards.
For this reason also, it is needful to plough up a deep furrow. This the Prophet signified
when he spoke thus, “Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.”1191
Therefore, as when he who has set the plough on the field, turns up the earth from below,
preparing beforehand a safe lodgment for the seeds, in order that they may not lie dispersed
over the surface, but may be hidden in the very womb of the earth, and deposit their roots
in safety: so also it is our business to act; and making use of the plough of tribulation to
break up the depth of the heart. For another Prophet admonishes of this, when he says,
“Rend your hearts and not your garments.”1192 Let us then rend our hearts, that if any evil
plant, any treacherous thought be present in us, we may tear it up by the roots, and provide
a pure soil for the seeds of godliness. For if we do not now break up the fallow ground; if
we do not now sow; if we do not now water it with tears, whilst it is a time of tribulation
and fasting, when shall we ever be brought to compunction? Will it be when we are at ease,
and in luxury? But this is impossible. For ease and luxury generally lead to indolence, just
as tribulation leads back again to diligence; and restores to itself the mind that had wandered
abroad, and been dreaming after a multitude of objects.</p>
<p>3. Let us not then grieve on account of this despondency, but even give thanks to God,
for great is the gain that comes of tribulation. The husbandman, when he has sown the seed
he had gathered with so much labour, prays that a shower may come; and the ignorant man,
looking on, will be surprised at all that takes place; and perhaps say to himself, “what can
this man be doing? He is scattering what he has collected; and not only scattering, but he is
also mixing it up in the earth with much industry, so that it will be no easy matter for him
to collect these together again; and besides mixing them with the earth, he is moreover de-

siring a heavy rain, so that all he has cast therein will rot, and become mire.” Such a person
is also terrified when he observes the thunders bursting through the clouds, and the lightnings
striking downwards. But not so the farmer. He is glad and rejoices whilst beholding the
heavy rain. For he does not regard what is present, but awaits the future. He does not attend
to the thunderings, but is reckoning the number of his sheaves. He thinks not of the decaying
seed, but of the flourishing ears of corn; not of the tedious rain, but of the delightful dust
of the threshing floor. Thus indeed, also, should we regard, not our present tribulation, nor
the pain of it, but the benefit that may arise from it—the fruit that it will bring forth. Let us
wait for the sheaves of the threshing floor; for if we be sober, we shall be able to collect much
fruit from the present time, and to fill the granaries of our minds. If we be sober, we shall
not only be far from taking any harm from this trouble, but we shall also reap innumerable
benefits. But should we be slothful, even tranquillity will destroy us! Either of these things
is injurious to him who takes no heed; but they both profit him who lives with strictness.
And even as gold if it be covered with water, still shows its own proper beauty, and although
it should fall into the furnace, would again come forth brighter than before; but on the
other hand, should clay or grass be mixed with water, the one dissolves and the other corrupts;
and should they fall into the fire, the one is parched and the other is burnt up; so also in
truth it is with the just man and the sinner! For should the former enjoy repose, he remains
illustrious, even as gold is when immersed in water; and though he falls into trial, he becomes
the more illustrious, like gold when subjected to the test of fire; but the sinner, if he obtains
rest, is enervated and corrupted like the grass and the clay, when they come in contact with
water; and should he undergo trial, he is burnt up and destroyed, in the same way as the
grass and the clay are by the action of fire!</p>
<p>4. Let us not then be out of heart for the present evils; for if thou hast any sins1193 remaining,
they will disappear, and easily be burnt up by the tribulation; but if thou possessest
virtue, thou wilt become thereby more illustrious and distinguished; for if thou art continually
vigilant and sober, thou wilt be superior to all injury. For it is not the nature of the trials,
but the listlessness of those who are tried, that is apt to cause their overthrow. So that if thou
desirest to rejoice, and to enjoy ease and pleasure, seek neither for pleasure nor ease, but
seek for a soul full of patience, and one that is able to manifest fortitude; since if thou hast
not this, not only will trial put thee to shame, but repose will destroy and overthrow thee
yet more signally. For to prove that it is not the attack of evils, but the listlessness of the
mind which subverts our salvation, hear what Christ saith: “Whosoever heareth these sayings
<note type="footnote">1193 ƒμαρτίας. This seems from the contrast to mean “sinful habits,” which trouble affords facilities for
amending. Had he meant removing guilt, he would probably have said ƒμαρτήματα, or κηλῖδας, as Hom. I. 22.
See also Hom. III. 21, where he speaks of the removal of guilt as depending on the use made of chastisement.

of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a
rock; and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that
house; and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.” And again: “Every one who heareth
these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built
his house upon the sand; and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew,
and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it.”1194 Do you perceive that
it was not the attack of these trials that produced the overthrow, but the folly of the builders?
For there was rain there, and there was rain here; there were floods there, and there were
floods here; here the beating of winds, and there again the same. The one man built a house,
and the other built a house. The building was the same; the trials were the same; but the end
was not the same; because there was not the same foundation. For the folly of the builder,
not the nature of the trials, caused the fall of the building; otherwise the house that was
founded upon the rock should have fallen, whereas nothing of that kind befell it. But do not
suppose that these things were spoken merely of a house; for the discourse relates to a soul,
giving proof by its works that it hears the divine word, or rejects it. Thus Job builded up his
soul. The rain descended;—for the fire fell from heaven and devoured all his flocks; the
floods came;—the frequent,—the constant,—the successive messengers of his calamities,
telling him of the destruction of his herds—of his camels—of his children. The winds
blew,—the bitter words of his wife:—“Curse God,” she said, “and die.”1195 Yet the house
fell not: the soul was not supplanted: the just man did not blaspheme; but even gave thanks
thus, saying, “The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away. As it pleased the Lord, so is it
come to pass.”1196 Seest thou that not the nature of the trials, but the negligence of the indolent,
is wont to cause the overthrow? since tribulation makes the strong man stronger.
Who saith this? It is the man who lived in tribulation, the blessed Paul; he speaks thus:
“Tribulation worketh patience, and patience probation, and probation hope.”1197 And even
as the violence of the wind, when it rushes upon strong trees, and sways them in all directions,
does not root them up, but renders them still firmer and stronger by these attacks; so the
soul that is holy, and lives in a religious state, is not supplanted by the inroads of trial and
tribulation, but stimulated thereby to more patience; even as the blessed Job, whom they
made more illustrious and honourable.</p>
<p>5. At the present time then, a man is angry with us, a man of like passions, and of like
soul, and we are afraid: but in the case of Job it was an evil and malignant demon who was
angry; nay, he was not simply angry, but set in motion all sorts of machinations, and brought

forward every stratagem; and yet even with all he could not conquer the fortitude of the just
man. But here is a man, who is at one time angry, at another time is reconciled; and we are
nevertheless dead with fear. On that occasion it was a devil that waged war, who is never
reconciled to human nature, but has engaged in a war without treaty, and a battle without
truce against our race; yet nevertheless, the just man laughed his darts to scorn. What apology
then, or what pardon can be ours, if we cannot sustain a human trial; we who are taught
such spiritual wisdom under grace; when this man before grace, and before the Old Testament,
endured this most grievous war so nobly! These things, beloved, we should therefore
always discourse of with one another; and by words of this kind encourage ourselves. For
ye are witnesses, and your conscience is a witness how much gain we have already received
from this trial! The dissolute man hath now become sober; the bold man meek; the slothful
man active. They who never at any time saw a church, but constantly spent their time at the
theatre, now remain in the church the whole day long. Tell me then, dost thou grieve on
this account, that God hath made thee earnest through fear; that He hath led thee by tribulation
to a sense of thine own safety? But is thy conscience pained? Yea, is thy mind pierced
every day as with a dart, expecting death, and the greatest wrath? Nevertheless, from thence
too we shall gain a great advance toward virtue, if our piety is made more earnest by means
of the distress. For God is able to free you from all these evils this day. But not until He sees
that you are purified; not until He sees that a conversion has taken place, and a repentance
firm and unshaken, will He entirely remove the tribulation. The goldsmith, until he perceives
the gold well refined, will not draw it out from the furnace; and even so God will not take
away this cloud before He hath thoroughly amended us. For He Himself who hath permitted
this trial, knows the time for removing it. So it is also with one who plays the harp; he neither
overstrains the string, lest he break it, nor relaxes it too much, lest he mar the consonance
of its harmony. Thus does God act. He neither places our souls in a state of constant repose,
nor of lengthened tribulation; making use of both these at His discretion; for he neither
suffers us to enjoy continual repose, lest we should grow listless, nor on the other hand does
he permit us to be in constant tribulation, lest we sink under it, and become desperate.</p>
<p>6. Let us then leave to Him the time for the removal of our evils; let us only pray; let us
live in piety: for this is our work, to turn to virtue; but to set us free from these evils is God’s
work! For indeed He is more desirous to quench this fire than thou who art tried by it: but
He is waiting for thy salvation. As tribulation then came of rest, so also after tribulation,
rest must be expected. For neither is it always winter, nor always summer; neither are there
always waves, nor always a calm; neither always night, nor always day. Thus tribulation is
not perpetual, but there will be also repose; only in our tribulation, let us give thanks to God
always. For the three youths were cast into the furnace, and did not even for this forget their
piety; neither did the flames affright them, but more earnestly than men sitting in a chamber,
and suffering nothing to alarm them, did they, whilst encircled by the fire, send up to

<pb n="517"/>
heaven those sacred prayers1198—therefore the fire became a wall unto them, and the flame
a robe; and the furnace was a fountain; and whereas it received them bound, it restored
them free. It received bodies that were mortal, but abstained from them as if they had been
immortal! It knew their nature, yet it reverenced their piety! The tyrant bound their feet,
and their feet bound the operation of the fire! O marvellous thing! The flame loosed those
who were bound, and was itself afterwards bound by those who had been in bonds; for the
piety of the youths changed the nature of things; or rather it did not change the nature, but,
what was far more wonderful, it stayed the operation of them, even whilst their nature remained.
For it did not quench the fire, but though burning, made it powerless. And it was
truly marvellous and unaccountable, that this not only happened with respect to the bodies
of these saints, but also with respect to their garments, and their shoes. And as it was in the
case of the Apostles, the garments of Paul expelled diseases and demons,1199 and the shadow1200
of Peter1201 put death to flight; so indeed also in this case, the shoes of these youths
extinguished the power of the fire.</p>
<p>7. I know not how I should speak, for the wonder surpasses all description! The force
of the fire was both quenched and not quenched: for whilst it came in contact with the
bodies of these saints, it was quenched; but when it was needful to burst their bonds, it was
not quenched; wherefore it broke their bonds, but touched not their ancles.1202 Do you see
how very near it was? Yet the fire was not deceived, and dared not penetrate within the
bonds. The tyrant bound, and the flame set loose; that thou mightest learn at once the
fierceness of the barbarian, and the submissiveness of the element. For what reason did he
bind, when he was about to cast into the fire? In order that the miracle might be the greater;
that the sign might be the more unaccountable; that thou mayest not suppose that the things
seen were an optical delusion. For if that fire had been no fire, it would not have consumed
the bands; and what is much more, it would not have seized upon the soldiers who were
placed without the furnace; but as the case was, it showed its power upon those without;
but towards those within, its submissiveness. But observe, I pray, in everything, how the
devil by the very same means with which he fights with the servants of God, pulls down his
own power; not intentionally, but because the wisdom and abundant contrivance of God
<note type="footnote">1198 St. Chrysostom refers to the Benedicite, or “Song of the Three Children.” In his book Quod nemo
læditur nisi a seipso, he calls it “That admirable and marvellous song, which from that day to this hath been sung
every where throughout the world, and shall yet be sung in future generations.” Ben. t. iii. 464; E. quoted by

<pb n="518"/>
turns all his weapons and devices upon his own head; which assuredly happened on that
occasion. For the devil at that time inspiring the tyrant, neither suffered the heads of the
saints to be cut off with the sword, nor that they should be delivered to wild beasts, nor
punished in any such manner; but that they should be thrown into the fire; to the end that
not even any relics of these saints should remain, their bodies being altogether consumed,
and their ashes being mingled with the ashes of the fagots. But God accordingly employed
this very circumstance for the taking away of impiety.1203 And how? I will tell you. Fire is
accounted by the Persians to be a god; and the barbarians, who inhabit that country even
now honour it with much worship. God, therefore, being desirous to pull up by the roots
the material of impiety, permitted the punishment to take this form, in order that He might
give the victory to His servants before the eyes of all these fire-worshippers; persuading
them by the plain fact, that the gods of the Gentiles are in dread not of God only, but even
of the servants of God.</p>
<p>8. Consider, moreover, how the crown of this victory was woven by the adversaries, and
the enemies themselves were made witnesses of this trophy. For “Nebuchadnezzar,” it says,
“sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the sheriffs,
and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image, and they were all
gathered together.”1204 The enemy prepares the theatre, and he himself collects together
the spectators, and prepares the lists; a theatre too, not of chance persons, or of some private
individuals, but of all those who were honourable and in authority, to the end that their
testimony may be worthy of credit with the multitude. They had come summoned for one
thing; but they all departed having beheld another thing. They came in order to worship
the image; and they departed, having derided the image, and struck with wonder at the
power of God, through the signs which had taken place with respect to these young men.
And observe, where the field for this display was spread out. No city, nor select enclosure
furnished room for this theatre of the whole world, but smooth and naked plains. For in
the plain of Dura, outside the city, he set up the image, and the herald came and cried, “To
you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages, that at what time ye hear the sound
of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down
and worship the golden image;” (for a fall indeed it was to worship the idol) “and whoso
falleth not down, and worshippeth, shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning
fiery furnace.”1205 Seest thou how difficult these struggles are made; how irresistible the
snare; and how deep the gulph, and a precipice on either hand? But be not afraid. In whatever

<note type="footnote">1205 Dan. iii. 4, 6.</note>

<pb n="519"/>
degree the enemy increases his machinations, so much the more does he display the courage
of the young men. For this reason is there this symphony of so many musicians; for this
reason the burning furnace; in order that both pleasure, and fear, may besiege the souls of
those present. Is there any one of harsh and unyielding character among them? “Let the
melody of every kind of music,” saith he, “enchant and soften him.” But is he superior to
this artifice, “let the sight of the flame affright and astound him.” Thus was fear as well as
pleasure present; the one entering to assault the soul by the ears, the other by the eyes. But
the noble character of these youths was not by any such means to be conquered; but even
as, when they fell into the fire, they mastered the flames, even so they derided all desire and
all fear. For it was for them the devil had prepared all these things beforehand. For he had
no doubts of his own subjects, but was exceedingly confident that no one would resist the
royal mandate. But when all fell down, and were subdued, then the youths alone are led into
the midst; in order that from this too the conquest may become the more illustrious, they
alone conquering and being proclaimed victors among so vast a multitude. For this would
not have been so surprising if they had acted courageously at the first, when as yet no one
had been overthrown. But the greatest, and most astonishing fact was, that the multitude
of those who fell down, neither affrighted, nor enfeebled them. They did not say to themselves
any such things as many are ofttimes wont to say; “If we were the first, and the only persons
to worship the image, this would have been a sin: but if we do this with so many myriads,
who will not make allowance? who will not think us worthy of defence?” nothing of that
sort did they say or think, when they beheld the prostrate forms1206 of so many tyrants.1207
Consider thou also with me the wickedness of those who were their accusers, and how maliciously
and bitterly they brought the accusation! “There are,” say they, “certain Jews whom
thou hast set up over the works of the province of Babylon.” They did not merely make
mention of the nation, but they also bring to mind their honourable condition, that they
may inflame the wrath of the king; almost as if they had said, “These slaves, these captives,
who are without a city, thou hast made rulers over us. But they shew contempt for such
honour, and treat insolently him who has given them this honour!” Therefore they say this;
“The Jews whom thou hast set over the works of the province of Babylon, obey not thy decree,
nor serve thy gods.”1208 The accusation becomes their greatest praise; and the crimes imputed,
their encomium; a testimony indeed that is indubitable, since their enemies bring it
forward. What then does the king? He commands that they should be brought into the
midst, so that he may affright them in every way. But nothing dismayed them, neither the
wrath of the king, nor their being left alone in the midst of so many, nor the sight of the fire,
<note type="footnote">1206 πτώματα, usually of fallen carcases.</note>
<note type="footnote">1207 Or princes, πυρ€ννων.</note>
<note type="footnote">1208 Dan. iii. 12.</note>

<pb n="520"/>
nor the sound of the trumpet, nor the whole multitude looking fire at them; for deriding all
these things, as if they were about to be cast into a cool fountain of water, they entered the
furnace uttering that blessed sentence, “We will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden
image which thou hast set up.”1209</p>
<p>9. I have not referred to this history without reason, but that ye may learn that whether
it be the wrath of a king, or the violence of soldiers, or the envy of enemies, or captivity, or
destitution, or fire, or furnace, or ten thousand terrors, nothing will avail to put to shame
or terrify a righteous man. For if where the king was godless the youths were not dismayed
at the tyrant’s wrath, how much more ought we to be confident, having an emperor who is
humane and merciful, and to express thankfulness to God for this tribulation, knowing
from what has now been said, that tribulations render men more illustrious both in the
presence of God and of man, if they know how to bear them with fortitude! For indeed if
these had not been made slaves, we should not have known their freedom! If they had not
been captives, we should not have learned their nobility of soul! If they had not been exiles
from their country below, we should not have known the excellency of their citizenship
above! If the earthly king had not been angry with them, we should not have known the favour
with which they were regarded by the heavenly King!</p>
<p>10. Thou too then, if thou hast Him for thy Friend, be not despairing, although thou
fallest into the furnace: and in like manner if He be angry, think not thou art safe though
thou be in Paradise. For Adam indeed was in Paradise, yet, when he had provoked God,
Paradise profited him nothing. These youths were in the furnace; yet, since they were approved,
the furnace injured them not at all. Adam was in Paradise, but when he was supine,
he was supplanted! Job sat down on the dunghill, yet, since he was vigilant he prevailed! Yet
how much better was Paradise than a dunghill! still the excellency of the place benefitted in
no degree the inhabitant; forasmuch as he had betrayed himself; as likewise indeed the
vileness of the place did to one no injury, who was fortified on every side with virtue. As to
ourselves then, let us fortify our souls; for if the loss of wealth should threaten us, or even
death, and yet no one can rob us of our religion, we are the happiest of men, Christ commended
this when he said, “Be ye wise as serpents.”1210 For just as he exposes the whole
body in order that he may save the head,1211 so also do thou. Although it should be necessary
to expose wealth, or the body, or the present life, or all things, for the purpose of preserving
thy religion; be not cast down! For if thou depart hence in possession of that, God will restore
to thee all things with more abundant splendour, and will raise again thy body with greater

<pb n="521"/>
glory; and instead of riches, there will be the good things that surpass all power of description.
Did not Job sit naked on a dunghill, sustaining a life more grievous than ten thousand
deaths? Yet since he did not cast away his piety, all his former things came back to him in
greater abundance, soundness and beauty of body; his full band of children; his possessions;
and what was greater than all, the splendid crown of his patience. For as it happens with
trees, should any one pluck away the fruit and the leaves together; should he even cut off
all the branches letting the root only remain; the tree will rise again entire, with greater
beauty, so indeed is it also with us. If the root of piety remain, although wealth be taken
away, although the body destroyed, all things again revert to us with greater glory than before.
Casting away therefore all anxiety and superfluous care, let us return to ourselves; and let
us adorn the body and the soul with the ornament of virtue; converting our bodily members
into instruments of righteousness and not instruments of sin.</p>
<p>11. And first of all, let us discipline our tongue to be the minister of the grace of the
Spirit, expelling from the mouth all virulence and malignity, and the practice of using disgraceful
words. For it is in our power to make each one of our members an instrument of
wickedness, or of righteousness. Hear then how men make the tongue an instrument, some
of sin, others of righteousness! “Their tongue is a sharp sword.”1212 But another speaks thus
of his own tongue: “My tongue1213 is the pen of a ready writer.”1214 The former wrought
destruction; the latter wrote the divine law. Thus was one a sword, the other a pen, not according
to its own nature, but according to the choice of those who employed it. For the
nature of this tongue and of that was the same, but the operation was not the same. And
again, as to the mouth likewise, we may see this same thing. For these had a mouth full of
filth and of wickedness, therefore against such it is said by way of accusation, “Their mouth
is full of cursing and bitterness;”1215 not such was his, but “My mouth shall speak of wisdom,
and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.”1216 Again, there were others
who had their hands full of iniquity, and accusing these he said, “Iniquities are in their
hands, and their right hand is filled with gifts.”1217 But he himself had hands practised in
nothing but in being stretched out towards heaven. Therefore he said of these too, “The
<note type="footnote">1212 Ps. lvii. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">1213 The references in the Psalms are made to the English version, which is divided as the Hebrew, except
that it sometimes varies a verse or two. LXX. and Vulg. annex Ps. x. to ix., and call Ps. xi. Ps. x., and so on till

<pb n="522"/>
lifting up of my hands (let it be) an evening sacrifice.”1218 The same may also be perceived
with reference to the heart; for their heart indeed was foolish, but this man’s was true; hence
he speaks of them thus, “Their heart is vain;” but of his own, “My heart is inditing of a good
matter.”1219 And as to the ear, one may see that the case is the same; for some have a sense
of hearing like that of beasts, which is not to be charmed or moved to pity; and reproaching
such the Psalmist says, “They are like the deaf adder, that stoppeth her ears.”1220 But his
ear was the receptacle of the divine words, and this he again makes manifest, when he says,
“I will incline mine ear to a parable, I will open my dark speech upon the harp.”1221</p>
<p>12. Knowing these things then, let us fortify ourselves with virtue on all sides, and thus
we shall avert the wrath of God, and let us make the members of the body instruments of
righteousness; and let us discipline eyes, and mouth, and hands, and feet, and heart, and
tongue, and the1222 whole body, to be employed only in the service of virtue. And let us
remember those three precepts, of which I discoursed1223 to your Charity, exhorting you
to consider no one as an enemy, nor to speak evil of any one of those who have aggrieved
you; and to expel from your mouth the evil custom of oaths. And with respect to the two
former precepts, we will discourse to you on another occasion; but we shall speak to you
during the whole of the present week respecting oaths; thus beginning with the easier precept.
For it is no labour at all to overcome the habit of swearing, if we would but apply a little
endeavour, by reminding each other; by advising; by observing; and by requiring those who
thus forget themselves, to render an account, and to pay the penalty. For what advantage
shall we gain by abstinence from meats, if we do not also expel the evil habits of the soul?
Lo, we have spent the whole of this day fasting; and in the evening we shall spread a table,
not such as we did on yester-eve, but one of an altered and more solemn kind.1224 Can any
one of us then say that he has changed his life too this day; that he has altered his ill custom,
as well as his food? Truly, I suppose not! Of what advantage then is our fasting? Wherefore
I exhort,1225 and I will not cease to exhort, that undertaking each precept separately, you
should spend two or three days in the attainment of it; and just as there are some who rival

one another in fasting, and shew a marvellous emulation in it; (some indeed who spend two
whole days without food; and others who, rejecting from their tables not only the use of
wine, and of oil, but of every dish, and taking only bread and water, persevere in this practice
during the whole of Lent); so, indeed, let us also contend mutually with one another in abolishing
the frequency1226 of oaths. For this is more useful than any fasting; this is more
profitable than any austerity. And this same care which we display in abstaining from food,
let us exhibit with respect to abstinence from oaths; since we shall be chargeable with the
reproach of extreme folly, while we regard not things that are forbidden, and expend all our
care upon things indifferent; for to eat is not forbidden, but to swear is forbidden; we,
however, abstaining from those things that are permitted, daringly venture upon those
things that are forbidden! On this account I beseech your Charity to make some change,
and to let the beginning of it be visible from this day. For if we spend the whole of the present
fast with such zeal, having in this week attained the practice of not swearing at all; and in
the following having extinguished wrath; and in that which succeeds it, having pulled up
evil-speaking by the roots; and after that, having amended what yet remains; thus going
forward in our course, we shall come by little and little to the very summit of virtue; and we
shall escape the present danger; and shall make God propitious; and the multitude will come
back again to our city; and we shall teach the fugitives that we are to place our hopes of
safety neither in security of place, nor in flight and retirement; but in piety of soul, and in
virtue of manners. And thus shall we obtain the good things of this and of the future life;
which, God grant! we may all be found worthy of, by the grace and loving-kindness of our
Lord Jesus Christ, through whom and with whom be glory to the Father, together with the
Holy Ghost, now and for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

to as examples. It is shewn that men ought not to fear death, but sin. What it is to
die miserably is explained; and the Homily concludes with an earnest dissuasive against
the use of oaths.</p>
<p>1. The discourse concerning the three young men, and the Babylonian furnace, did, as
it would seem, yesterday give no small comfort to your Charity; and still more the example
in the case of Job, and that dunghill more to be venerated than any kingly throne. For from
seeing a royal throne no advantage results to the spectators, but only a temporary pleasure,
which has no profit; but from the sight of Job’s dunghill, one may derive every kind of benefit,
yea, much divine wisdom and consolation, in order to patience. Therefore to this day many
undertake a long pilgrimage,1227 even across the sea, hastening from the extremities of the
earth, as far as Arabia, that they may see that dunghill; and having beheld it, may kiss the
land, which contained the wrestling-ground1228 of such a victor, and received the blood
that was more precious than all gold! For the purple shines not so brilliantly, as did that
body when dyed1229 not in another’s blood, but in its own! Even those very wounds were
more precious than all manner of jewels! For the nature of pearls is of no help to our life;
nor do they satisfy any necessary want on the part of those who have them. But those wounds
are a consolation for all sadness; and that thou mayest learn this to be the truth, suppose
any one were to lose a beloved and only son. Shew him ten thousand pearls, and you will
not console his grief, or lighten his anguish; but recall to his mind the wounds of Job, and
thou wouldest easily be able to minister comfort by speaking thus: “Why sorrowest thou,
O man? Thou hast lost one son; but that blessed man, after he had been bereaved of the
whole family of his children, both received a plague in his own flesh, and sat down naked
upon the dunghill, streaming with gore from every part, and his flesh gradually wasting
away; even he who was just, and true, so devout a man, who stained from every evil deed,
and had even God for a witness to his virtue.” By speaking thus thou wouldest extinguish
all the sufferer’s sadness, and remove all his distress. Thus the wounds of the just man become
more useful than pearls!</p>
<p>2. Figure to yourselves then this wrestler; and imagine that you see that dunghill, and
himself sitting in the midst of it! That golden statue! set with gems! I know not how to express

it: for I am unable to find any material so precious as to compare it with that body stained
with blood! So far above every substance, however costly, was the nature of that flesh, beyond
all comparison more precious, and those wounds more splendid than the sun’s beams; for
these illumine the eyes of the body; but those enlighten the eyes of the mind! those struck
the devil with utter blindness! Therefore it was, that after that blow, he started back and
appeared no more. And do thou, O beloved, learn thence too what advantage there is in
tribulation! For when the just man was rich, and enjoyed ease, he had the means of accusing
him. However falsely, yet still he had it in his power to say, “Doth Job serve thee for nought?”
But after he had stripped him and made him poor, he dared not even open his mouth any
more. When he was wealthy, he prepared to wrestle with him, and threatened to overthrow
him; but when he had made him poor, and taken away all he had, and thrown him into the
deepest distress, then he started back. When indeed his body was sound, he lifted up his
hands against him,1230 but when he had battered his flesh, then he fled,—defeated! Seest
thou how to the vigilant, poverty is much better and more beneficial than riches; and infirmity
and sickness, than health; and trial, than tranquillity; inasmuch as it makes the combatants
more illustrious and vigorous?</p>
<p>3. Who hath seen or heard of such an astonishing contest? The fighters in worldly
contests, when they have battered the heads of their adversaries, are then victorious, and
are crowned! But this adversary, when he had battered the body of the just man, perforating
it with ulcers of every kind, and had reduced him to great weakness, was then conquered,
and drew back. Even when he had pierced his ribs in every direction, he was no gainer
thereby; for he spoiled him not of his hidden treasure, but he made him more conspicuous
to us; and through that piercing he gave to all the privilege to look into his interior, and to
discern completely the whole of his wealth! When he expected to prevail, then he withdrew
with much ignominy, and never again uttered a syllable! What is the matter, O devil? For
what cause withdrawest thou? Was not everything done that thou chosest? Hast thou not
taken away his flocks, his herds, his droves of horses and of mules? Hast thou not also destroyed
his troop of children? and battered his flesh to pieces. For what reason withdrawest
thou? “Because,” saith he, “every thing I chose1231 is come to pass, and yet that which I most
desired should come to pass, and for which I did all those things, is not come to pass; he
hath not blasphemed! For it was in order to this, continues he, that I was doing all those
things; and as this is not come to pass, I am no gainer by having deprived him of his wealth;
or by the destruction of his children; or by the plague inflicted upon his body; but the reverse
of what I purposed hath come to pass; I have made my enemy more illustrious; I have added

<pb n="526"/>
lustre to his reputation.” Perceivest thou, O beloved, how great was the reward of tribulation?
His body was fair and sound before, but it became more venerable, when pierced through
and through by these wounds! And thus wool, fair as it is before the dyeing, when it becomes
purple, takes an indescribable beauty, and an additional grace. But if he had not stripped
him, we should not have known the good condition1232 of the victor; if he had not pierced
the body with ulcers, the rays within would not have shone forth. If he had not made him
sit down upon a dunghill, we should not have known his wealth. For a king sitting on a
throne is not so illustrious, as this man was notable and conspicuous, whilst sitting upon
his dunghill! For after the royal throne, comes death; but after that dunghill, the kingdom
of heaven!</p>
<p>4. Collecting then all these reasons, let us raise ourselves from the dejection which oppresses
us. For I have laid these histories before you, not that ye may applaud what is spoken,
but that ye may imitate the virtue and the patience of such noble men; that ye may learn
from the very facts, that there is nothing of human ills to be dreaded, save sin only; neither
poverty, nor disease, nor insult, nor malicious treatment, nor ignominy, nor death, which
is accounted the worst of all evils. To those who love spiritual wisdom, such things are only
the names of calamities; names which have no substantial reality. But the true calamity
consists in offending God, and in doing aught which is displeasing to Him. For tell me, what
is there in death which is terrible? Is it because it transports thee more quickly to the
peaceful haven, and to that life which is free from tumult? Although man should not put
thee to death, will not the very law of nature, at length stealing upon thee, separate the body
from the soul; and if this event which we fear does not happen now, it will happen shortly.</p>
<p>5. I speak thus, not anticipating any dread or melancholy event:1233 God forbid! But
because I am ashamed for those who are afraid of death. Tell me, whilst expecting such good
things as “eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered the heart of man,”1234 dost
thou demur about this enjoyment, and art negligent and slothful; and not only slothful, but
fearful and trembling? And is it not shameful that thou art distressed on account of death,
whereas Paul groaned on account of the present life, and writing to the Romans said, “The
creation groaneth together, and ourselves also which have the first fruits of the Spirit do
groan.”1235 And he spoke thus, not as condemning the things present, but longing for the
things to come. “I have tasted,” saith he, “of the grace, and I do not willingly put up with
the delay.1236 I have the first fruits of the Spirit, and I press on towards the whole. I have

ascended to the third heaven; I have seen that glory which is unutterable; I have beheld the
shining palaces; I have learnt what joys I am deprived of, while I linger here, and therefore
do I groan.” For suppose any one had conducted thee into princely halls, and shewn thee
the gold everywhere glittering on the walls, and all the rest of the glorious show; if from
thence he had led thee back afterward to a poor man’s hut, and promised that in a short
time he would bring thee back to those palaces, and would there give thee a perpetual
mansion; tell me, wouldest thou not indeed languish with desire, and feel impatient, even
at these few days? Thus think then of heaven, and of earth, and groan with Paul, not because
of death, but because of the present life!</p>
<p>6. But grant me, saith one, to be like Paul, and I shall never be afraid of death. Why,
what is it that forbids thee, O man, to become like Paul? Was he not a poor man? Was he
not a tent maker? Was he not a man of humble position? For if he had been rich and high
born, the poor, when called upon to imitate his zeal, would have had their poverty to plead;
but now thou canst say nothing of this sort. For this man was one who exercised a manual
art, and supported himself too by his daily labours. And thou, indeed, from the first hast
inherited true religion from thy fathers; and from thy earliest age hast been nourished in
the study of the sacred writings; but he was “a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious,”
1237 and ravaged the Church! Nevertheless, he so changed all at once, as to surpass all
in the vehemence of his zeal, and he cries out, saying, “Be ye imitators of me, even as I also
am of Christ.”1238 He imitated the Lord; and wilt not thou who hast been educated in piety
from the first, imitate a fellow-servant; one who by conversion was brought to the faith at
a later period of life? Knowest thou not, that they who are in sins are dead whilst they live;
and that they who live1239 in righteousness, although they be dead, yet they live?1240 And
this is not my word. It is the declaration of Christ speaking to Martha, “He that believeth
in me though he were dead yet shall he live.”1241 Is our doctrine, indeed, a fable? If thou art
a Christian, believe in Christ; if thou believest in Christ, shew me thy faith by thy works.1242
But how mayest thou shew this? By thy contempt of death: for in this we differ from the
unbelievers. They may well fear death; since they have no hope of a resurrection. But thou,
who art travelling toward better things, and hast the opportunity of meditating on the hope
of the future; what excuse hast thou, if whilst assured of a resurrection, thou are yet at the
same time as fearful of death, as those who believe not the resurrection?</p>

<p>7. But I have no fear of death, says one, nor of the act of dying, but of a miserable death,
of being beheaded. Did John then, I ask, die miserably? for he was beheaded. Or did Stephen
die miserably? for he was stoned; and all the martyrs have thus died wretchedly, according
to this objection: since some have ended their lives by fire; and others by the sword; and
some cast into the ocean; others down a precipice; and others into the jaws of wild beasts,
have so come by their death. To die basely, O man, is not to come to one’s end by a violent
death, but to die in sin! Hear, at least, the prophet moralising on this very matter, and saying,
“The death of sinners is evil.”1243 He does not say that a violent death is evil; but what then?
“The death of sinners is evil.”1244 And justly so; for after the departure from this life, there
is an intolerable punishment; undying vengeance, the envenomed worm; the fire unquenchable,
the outer darkness, the chains indissoluble; the gnashing of teeth, the tribulation, and
the anguish, and the eternal justice.1245</p>
<p>8. Since therefore such evils await sinners, what advantage can it be to them, though
they should end their days at home, and in their bed? Even so, on the other hand, it can do
no harm to the righteous to lay down the present life through sword, or steel, or fire, when
they are to depart to the good things that are immortal. Truly “the death of sinners is evil.”
Such a death was that of the rich man, who despised Lazarus. He, when he had terminated
his life by a natural end, at home and on his bed, and with his relatives about him, experienced
after his departure to the other world a fiery torment; nor was he able to obtain there even
a little comfort, out of all the pleasure he had enjoyed in the present life! But not so was it
with Lazarus; for when lying upon the pavement, while the dogs came and licked his sores,
he had suffered a violent death (for what could be more painful than hunger?), but on his
departing hence he enjoyed eternal blessings, luxuriating in the bosom of Abraham! In what
respect, then, did it injure him that he died a violent death? or what did it profit the rich
man, that he died not with violence?</p>
<p>9. But, says some one, “We have no fear of dying by violence, but of dying unjustly; and
of being punished in a similar way with the guilty,—we who have had nothing to do with
<note type="footnote">1243 In this rendering of the Septuagint there is a coincidence with that of the Targum, and the Vulgate,

sinners is the worst thing that can happen unto them.” “What meaneth he by that? he signifieth unto us, that
the wicked be not enough punished here, therefore it shall be worse with them after their death. So that it shall
be a change: they that have their pleasure here, and live according to their desires, they shall come to afflictions
in the other world.”</note>

the crimes of which we are suspected.” What sayest thou, tell me? Art thou afraid of dying
unjustly, and wouldest thou wish to die justly. But who is there so wretched and miserable,
that when he had the alternative of dying unjustly, would rather depart by an act of justice?
For if it be necessary to fear death, it is necessary to fear it when it comes upon us justly;
since he indeed who dies unjustly, is by this very means made a partaker with all the saints.
For many of those who were approved and distinguished by God, have been subjected to
an unjust end; and first of all Abel. For it was not that he had sinned against his brother, or
done Cain any harm; but inasmuch as he had honoured God, therefore was he slaughtered.
But God permitted it. Was it, think you, because He loved him, or because He hated him?
Most clearly, because He loved him, and wished to make his crown the brighter, by that
most unjust murder. Seest thou then, that it becomes us not to be afraid of dying by violence;
nor yet of dying unjustly; but of dying in a state of sin? Abel died unjustly. Cain lived,
groaning and trembling! Which then, I would ask, was the more blessed of the two; he who
went to rest in righteousness, or he who lived in sin; he who died unjustly, or he who was
justly punished? Would you have me declare unto your Charity, whence it is that we are
afraid of death? The love of the kingdom hath not penetrated us, nor the desire of things to
come inflamed us: otherwise we should despise all present things, even as the blessed Paul
did. Add to this, on the other hand, that we do not stand in awe of hell; therefore death is
terrible. We are not sensible of the unsufferable nature of the punishment there; therefore,
instead of sin, we fear death; since if the fear of the one held possession of our souls, the fear
of the other would not be able to enter.</p>
<p>10. And this I will endeavour to make manifest, not from anything of a remote nature,
but from what is at our own doors; and from the events which have happened among us in
these days. For when the Emperor’s letter came, ordering that tribute to be imposed which
was thought to be so intolerable, all were in a tumult; all quarrelled with it; thought it a sore
grievance, resented it; and when they met one another said, “Our life is not worth living,
the city is undone;—no one will be able to stand under this heavy burden;” and they were
distressed as if placed in the extremest danger. After this, when the rebellion was actually
perpetrated, and certain vile, yea, thoroughly vile persons, trampling under foot the laws,
threw down the statues, and involved all in the utmost peril; and now that we are in fear for
our very lives, through the indignation of the Emperor, this loss of money no longer stings
us. But instead of such complaints, I hear from all a language of a different kind. “Let the
Emperor take our substance, we will gladly be deprived of our fields and possessions, if any
one will but ensure us safety for the bare body.” As therefore, before the fear of death pressed
upon us, the loss of our wealth tormented us; and after these lawless outrages had been
perpetrated, the fear of death succeeding, expelled the grief for that loss; so if the fear of hell
had held possession of our souls, the fear of death would not have possessed them. But even
as it is with the body, when two kinds of pain seize upon us, the more powerful usually

<pb n="530"/>
overshadows the weaker one, so also would it now happen; if the dread of future punishment
remained in the soul, that would overshadow all human fear. So that if any one endeavours
always to have the remembrance of hell, he will deride every kind of death; and this will not
only deliver him from the present distress, but will even rescue him from the flame to come.
For he who is always afraid of hell, will never fall into the fire of hell; being made sober by
this continual fear!</p>
<p>11. Permit me, that I now say to you at a fitting time, “Brethren, be not children in understanding;
howbeit in malice be ye children.”1246 For this is a childish terror of ours, if
we fear death, but are not fearful of sin. Little children too are afraid of masks, but fear not
the fire. On the contrary, if they are carried by accident near a lighted candle, they stretch
out the hand without any concern towards the candle and the flame; yet a mask which is so
utterly contemptible terrifies them; whereas they have no dread of fire, which is really a
thing to be afraid of. Just so we too have a fear of death, which is a mask that might well be
despised; but have no fear of sin, which is truly dreadful; and, even as fire, devours the
conscience! And this is wont to happen not on account of the nature of the things, but by
reason of our own folly; so that if we were once to consider what death is, we should at no
time be afraid of it. What then, I pray you, is death? Just what it is to put off a garment. For
the body is about the soul as a garment; and after laying this aside for a short time by means
of death, we shall resume it again with the more splendour. What is death at most? It is a
journey for a season; a sleep longer than usual! So that if thou fearest death, thou shouldest
also fear sleep! If for those who are dying thou art pained, grieve for those too who are eating
and drinking, for as this is natural, so is that! Let not natural things sadden thee; rather let
things which arise from an evil choice make thee sorrowful. Sorrow not for the dying man;
but sorrow for him who is living in sin!</p>
<p>12. Would you have me mention another reason on account of which we fear death?
We do not live with strictness, nor keep a clear conscience; for if this were the case nothing
would alarm us, neither death, nor famine, nor the loss of wealth, nor anything else of this
kind. For he who lives virtuously, cannot be injured by any of these things, or be deprived
of his inward pleasure. For being supported by favourable hopes, nothing will be able to
throw him into dejection. What is there that any one can possibly effect, by which he can
cause the noble-minded man to become sorrowful? Take away his riches? He has yet wealth
that is in the heavens! Cast him out of his country? He will take his journey to1247 that city
which is above! Load him with fetters? He has still his conscience free, and is insensible to
the external chain! Put his body to death? Yet he shall rise again! And as he who fights with
a shadow, and beaten the air, will be unable to hit any one; so he who is at war with the just
<note type="footnote">1246 1 Cor. xiv. 20.</note>
<note type="footnote">1247 στελεῖ εἰς, al. τελεῖ εἰς, is free of.</note>

<pb n="531"/>
man, is but striking at a shadow, and wasting his own strength, without being able to inflict
any injury upon him. Grant me then to be sure of the kingdom of heaven; and, if thou
wishest, slay me this day. I shall be thankful to thee for the slaughter; forasmuch as thou
sendest me quickly to the possession of those good things! “This, however,” says some one,
“is what we especially lament, that hindered as we are by the multitude of our sins, we shall
not attain to that kingdom.” Such being the case then, leave off lamenting death, and lament
thy sins, in order that thou mayest be freed from them! Grief, indeed, hath had its existence,
not that we should sorrow for the loss of wealth, nor for death, nor for anything else of that
kind, but that we may employ it for the taking away of our sins.1248 And I will make the
truth of this evident by an example. Healing medicines1249 have been made for those diseases
only which they are able to remove; not for those which are in no respect assisted by them.
For instance (for I wish to make the matter still plainer), the medicine which is able to benefit
a malady of the eyes only, and no other disease, one might justly say was made only for the
sake of the eyes; not for the stomach, nor for the hands, nor any other member. Let us then
transfer this argument to the subject of grief; and we shall find, that in none of those things
which happen to us, is it of any advantage, except to correct sin; whence it is apparent that
it hath had its existence only for the destruction of this. Let us now take a survey of each of
those evils which befall us, and let us apply despondency as a remedy, and see what sort of
advantage1250 results from it.</p>
<p>13. Some one is mulcted in property: he becomes sad, but this does not make good his
loss. Some one hath lost a son: he grieves, but he cannot raise the dead, nor benefit the departed.
Some one hath been scourged, beaten, and insulted; he becomes sorrowful. This
does not recall the insult. Some one falls into sickness, and a most grievous disease; he is
dejected. This does not remove his disease, but only makes it the more grievous. Do you see
that in none of these cases does sadness answer any useful purpose? Suppose that any one
hath sinned, and is sad. He blots out the sin; he gets free from the transgression. How is this
shewn? By the declaration of the Lord; for, speaking of a certain one who had sinned, He
said, “Because of his iniquity I made him sad for a while; and I saw that he was grieved, and
he went on heavily; and I healed his ways.”1251 Therefore also Paul saith, “Godly sorrow
worketh repentance unto salvation not to be repented of.”1252 Since then what I have said
<note type="footnote">1248 ƒμαρτημ€των, see Hom. IV. 4.</note>

<pb n="532"/>
clearly shews, that neither the loss of riches, nor insult, nor abuse, nor stripes, nor sickness,
nor death, nor any other thing of that kind can possibly be relieved by the interference of
grief, but sin only can it blot out and do away, it is evident that this is the only reason why
it hath its existence. Let us therefore no more grieve for the loss of wealth, but let us grieve
only when we commit sin. For great in this case is the gain that comes of sorrow. Art thou
amerced? Be not dejected, for thus thou wilt not be at all benefited. Hast thou sinned? Then
be sorry: for it is profitable; and consider the skill and wisdom of God. Sin hath brought
forth for us these two things, sorrow and death. For “in the day thou eatest,” He saith, “thou
shalt surely die;” and to the woman, “In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children.”1253 And
by both of these things he took away sin, and provided that the mother should be destroyed
by her offspring. For that death as well as grief takes away sin, is evident, in the first place,
from the case of the martyrs;1254 and it is plain too from what Paul saith to those who had
sinned, speaking on this wise, “For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and
many sleep.”1255 Inasmuch, he observes, as ye have sinned, ye die, so that ye are freed from
sin by death. Therefore he goes on to say, “For if we would judge ourselves, we should not
be judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be
condemned with the world.”1256 And even as the worm is brought forth from the wood,
and devours the wood; and a moth consumes the wool, from whence it originates; so grief
and death were born of sin, and devour sin.</p>
<p>14. Let us not then fear death, but let us only fear sin, and grieve on account of this. And
these things I speak, not anticipating any thing fearful, God forbid! but wishing you when
alarmed to be always thus affected, and to fulfil the law of Christ in very deed. For “he,”
saith Christ, “that taketh not his cross, and followeth after Me, is not worthy of Me.”1257
This He said, not that we should bear the wood upon our shoulders, but that we should always
have death before our eyes. Even so as Paul, that is, died daily, and laughed at death, and
despised the present life. For indeed thou art a soldier, and standest continually at arms;

but a soldier who is afraid of death, will never perform a noble action. Thus then neither
will a Christian man, if fearful of dangers, perform anything great or admirable; nay, besides
this, he will be apt to be easily vanquished. But not so is it with the man who is bold and
lofty minded. He remains impregnable and unconquerable. As then the Three Children,
when they feared not the fire, escaped from the fire, so also we, if we fear not death, shall
entirely escape from death. They feared not the fire (for it is no crime to be burnt), but they
feared sin, for it is a crime to commit impiety. Let us also imitate these and all such, and let
us not be afraid of dangers, and then we shall pass safely through them.</p>
<p>15. As for me, “I am not a prophet nor the son of a prophet,”1258 yet I understand clearly
thus much of the future, and I proclaim, both loudly and distinctly, that if we become
changed, and bestow some care upon our souls, and desist from iniquity, nothing will be
unpleasant or painful. And this I plainly know from the love of God toward man, as well as
from those things which He hath done for men, and cities, and nations, and whole populations.
For He threatened the city of Nineveh, and said, “There are yet three days,1259 and
Nineveh shall be overthrown.”1260 What then, I ask, Was Nineveh overthrown? Was the
city destroyed? Nay, quite the contrary; it both arose, and became still more distinguished;
and long as is the time which has elapsed, it has not effaced its glory, but we all still celebrate
and admire it even to this day.1261 For from that time it hath been a sort of excellent haven
for all who have sinned, not suffering them to sink into desperation, but calling all to repentance;
and by what it did, and by what it obtained of God’s favour, persuading men never to
despair of their salvation, but exhibiting the best life they can,1262 and setting before them
a1263 good hope, to be confident of the issue as destined in any wise to be favourable. For
who would not be stirred up on hearing of such an example, even if he were the laziest of
mortals?</p>

<p>16. For God even preferred that His own prediction should fall to the ground, so that
the city should not fall. Or rather, the prophecy did not even so fall to the ground. For if
indeed while the men continued in the same wickedness, the sentence had not taken effect,
some one perhaps might have brought a charge against what was uttered. But if when they
had changed, and desisted from their iniquity, God also desisted from His wrath, who shall
be able any longer to find fault with the prophecy, or to convict the things spoken of falsehood.
The same law indeed which God had laid down from the beginning, publishing it to
all men by the prophet, was on that occasion strictly observed. What then is this law? “I
shall speak a sentence,” saith He, “concerning a nation or a kingdom, to pluck up, and to
pull down, and to destroy it; and it shall be, that if they repent of their evil, I will also repent
of the wrath which I said I would do unto them.”1264 Guarding then this law, he saved those
who were converted and released from His wrath those who desisted from their wickedness.
He knew the virtue of the barbarians; therefore He hastened the prophet thither. Thus was
the city agitated at the time, when it heard the prophet’s voice, but instead of being injured
it was benefited by fear. For that fear was the cause of its safety. The threatening effected
the deliverance from the peril. The sentence of overthrow put a stop to the overthrow. O
strange and astonishing event! the sentence threatening death, brought forth life! The sentence
after it was published became cancelled; the very opposite to that which takes place
among temporal judges! for in their case the proclamation of the sentence causes it to become
valid, is fully to ratify it; but on the contrary, with God, the publication of the sentence,
caused it to be cancelled. For if it had not been published, the offenders would not have
heard; and if they had not heard, they would not have repented, and if they had not repented,
1265 they would not have warded off the punishment, nor would they have obtained that
astonishing deliverance. For how is it less than astonishing, when the judge declares sentence,
and the condemned discharge the sentence by their repentance! They, indeed, did not flee
from the city as we are now doing, but remaining in it they caused it to stand. It was a snare,
and they made it a fortification! It was a gulph, and a precipice, and they turned it into a
tower of safety! They had heard that the buildings would fall, and yet they fled not from the
buildings, but they fled from their sins. They did not depart each from his house as we do
now, but each departed from his evil way; for, said they, “why should we think the walls
have brought forth the wrath? we are the causes of the wound; we then should provide the
medicine.” Therefore they trusted for safety, not to a change of habitations,1266 but of
habits.1267</p>

<p>17. Thus did the barbarians! and are we not ashamed, and ought we not to hide our
faces, whilst instead of changing our habits, as they did, we change only our habitations;
privily removing our goods, and doing the deeds of men that are drunken? Our Master is
angry with us; and we, neglecting to appease His wrath, carry about our household stuff
from place to place, and run hither and thither, seeking where we may deposit our substance;
while we ought rather to seek where we may deposit our soul in safety; or rather, it behoveth
us not to seek, but to entrust its safety to virtue and uprightness of life. For when we were
angry and displeased with a servant, if he, instead of defending himself against our displeasure,
went down to his apartment, and collecting together his clothes, and binding up together
all his movables, meditated a flight, we could not tamely put up with this contempt. Let us
then desist from this unseasonable endeavour, and let us each say to God, “Whither shall I
go from Thy Spirit, and whither shall I flee from Thy presence?”1268 Let us imitate the
spiritual wisdom of the barbarians. They repented even on uncertain grounds! For the sentence
had no such clause, “If ye turn and repent, I will set up the city;” but simply, “Yet three
days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.”1269 What then said they? “Who knoweth whether
God will repent of the evil He said He would do unto us?” Who knoweth? They know not
the end of the event, and yet they do not neglect repentance! They are unacquainted with
God’s method of shewing mercy, and yet they change upon the strength of uncertainties!
For neither was it in their power to look at other Ninevites who had repented and been
saved; nor had they read prophets; nor had they heard patriarchs; nor had they enjoyed
counsel, or partaken of admonition; nor had they persuaded themselves that they should
certainly propitiate God by repentance. For the threatening did not imply this: but they
were doubtful, and hesitating concerning it; and yet they repented with all diligence. What
reason then shall we have to urge, when those, who had no ground for confidence as to the
issue, are seen to have exhibited so great a change; but thou who hast ground of confidence
in the mercy of God, and who hast frequently received many pledges of His care, and hast
heard prophets, and apostles, and hast been instructed by actual events; hast yet no emulation
to reach the same measure of virtue as these did! Great assuredly was their virtue! but
greater by far was the mercy of God! and this may be seen from the very greatness of the
threat. For this reason God did not add to the declaration, “But if ye repent. I will spare:”
in order that by setting forth a sentence without limitation, He might increase the fear and
having increased the fear, He might constrain them more speedily to repentance.</p>
<p>18. The prophet is indeed ashamed, foreseeing what the issue would be, and conjecturing
that what he had prophesied, would remain unaccomplished; God however is not ashamed,
but is desirous of one thing only, viz. the salvation of men, and corrects His own servant.

For when he had entered the ship, He straightway there raised a boisterous sea; in order
that thou mightest know that where sin is, there is a tempest; where there is disobedience,
there is the swelling of the waves.1270 The city was shaken because of the sins of the Ninevites;
and the ship was shaken because of the disobedience of the prophet. The sailors therefore
threw Jonah in the deep, and the ship was preserved. Let us then drown our sins, and our
city will assuredly be safe! Flight will certainly be no advantage to us; for it did not profit
him; on the contrary, it did him injury. He fled from the land indeed, but he fled not from
the wrath of God; he fled from the land, but he brought the tempest after him on the sea;
and so far was he from obtaining any benefit by his flight, that he plunged those also who
received him into the extremest peril. And whilst he sat sailing in the ship, although the
sailors, the pilots, and all the necessary apparatus of the ship were there present, he was
placed in the utmost danger. After, however, having been thrown out into the deep, and
having put away his sin by means of the punishment, he had been conveyed into that unstable1271
vessel, I mean, the whale’s belly, he enjoyed great security. This was for the purpose
of teaching thee, that as no ship can be of any use to him who is living in sin, so him who
has put away his sin, the sea cannot drown, nor monsters destroy. Of a truth, the waves received,
but they did not suffocate him. The whale received him, but did not destroy him;
but both the animal and the element gave back to God unhurt that, with which they were
entrusted; and by all these things the prophet was taught to be humane and merciful; and
not to be more cruel than wild beasts, or thoughtless sailors, or unruly waves. For even the
sailors did not immediately at first give him up, but after much compulsion; and the sea
and the monster guarded him with great kindness; all these things being under God’s direction.</p>
<p>19. Therefore he came back again; he preached; he threatened; he persuaded; he preserved;
he affrighted; he amended; he established; by one, and that the first preaching! Many
days he needed not, nor continued counsel; but speaking these simple words only, he brought
all to repentance! On this account God did not lead him directly from the ship into the city;
but the sailors committed him to the sea; the sea to the whale; the whale to God; God to the
Ninevites; and by this long circuit he brought back the fugitive, that he might instruct all,
that it is impossible to fly from the hands of God; that whithersoever any one may roam,
dragging his sin after him, he will have to undergo a thousand evils; and though no mortal
were present, yet on every side the whole creation will rise up against him with the utmost
vehemence! Let us not then provide for our safety by flight, but by a change of the moral

character. Is it for remaining in the city that God is angry with thee, that thou shouldest fly?
It is because thou hast sinned, that He is indignant. Lay aside therefore the sin, and where
the cause of thy wound lies, thence remove1272 the fountain of the evil. For the physicians
too give us directions to cure contraries by contraries. Is fever, for instance, produced by a
full diet? They subject the disease to the regimen of abstinence. Does any one fall sick from
sadness? They say that mirth is the suitable medicine for it. Thus also it befits us to act with
respect to diseases of the soul. Hath listlessness excited the wrath? let us shake this off by
zeal, and let us manifest in our conduct a great change. We have the fast, a very great auxiliary
and ally in our warfare; and besides the fast, we have the impending distress, and the
fear of danger. Now then, in season, let us be at work on the soul; for we shall easily be able
to persuade it to whatever we choose; since he who is alarmed and trembling, and set free
from all luxury, and who lives in terror, is able to practise moral wisdom without difficulty,
and to receive the seeds of virtue with much alacrity.</p>
<p>20. Let us therefore persuade it to make this first change for the better, by the avoidance
of oaths; for although I spake to you yesterday, and the day before,1273 on this same subject;
yet neither to-day, nor to-morrow, nor the day after, will I desist giving my counsel on this
subject. And why do I say to-morrow and the day following? Until I see that you are amended,
I will not abstain from doing so. If those, indeed, who transgress this law, are not ashamed,
far less should we who bid them not transgress it, feel this frequency of the admonition to
be a matter worthy of shame. For to be continually reminding men of the same topics is not
the fault of the speaker, but of the hearers, needing as they do perpetual instruction, upon
simple and easily-observed precepts. What indeed is easier than not to swear? It is only a
good work of habit. It is neither labour of the body, nor expenditure of wealth. Art thou
desirous to learn how it is possible to get the better of this infirmity, how it is possible to be
set free from this evil habit? I will tell thee of a particular method by which if pursued thou
wilt certainly master it. If thou seest either thyself or any other person, whether it be one of
thy servants, or of thy children, or thy wife, ensnared in this vice; when thou hast continually
reminded them of it, and they are not amended, order them to retire to rest supperless;1274
and impose this sentence upon thyself, as well as upon them, a sentence which will bring
with it no injury, but a gain. For such is the nature of spiritual acts; they bring profit and a

speedy reformation. The tongue when constantly punished, when straitened by thirst. and
pained by hunger, receives a sufficient admonition, even whilst no one is its monitor; and
though we were the most stupid of mortals, yet when we are thus reminded by the greatness
of the punishment during a whole day, we shall need no other counsel and exhortation.</p>
<p>21. Ye have applauded what I have spoken. But still shew me your applause too by deeds.
Else what is the advantage of our meeting here? Suppose a child were to go to school every
day, yet if he learnt nothing the more for it, would the excuse satisfy us that he every day
went there? Should we not esteem it the greatest fault, that going there daily, he did it to no
purpose. Let us consider this with ourselves, and let us say to ourselves, For so long a time
have we met together at church, having the benefit of a most solemn Communion,1275
which has in it much profit; and should we return back again just as we came, with none of
our defects corrected, of what advantage is our coming here? For most actions are done,
not for themselves, but for the effects which follow through their means; as, for example,
the sower does not sow for the mere sake of sowing, but in order that he may reap too; since
if this were not to follow, the sowing would be a loss, the seeds rotting without any kind of
advantage. The merchant doth not take a voyage merely for sailing’s sake, but that he may
increase his substance by going abroad; since, if this be not attained beside, extreme mischief
will result, and the voyage of merchants were but for loss. Let us indeed consider this in relation
to ourselves. We also meet together in the church, not for the mere purpose of
spending time here, but in order that we may return having gained a great and spiritual
benefit. Should we then depart empty, and without having received any advantage, this our
diligence becomes our condemnation! In order that this may not occur, and extreme mischief
result, on departing from this place, let friends practise with one another; fathers with children;
and masters with servants; and train yourselves to perform the task assigned you; so
that when ye come back again, and hear us giving you counsel on the same subjects, ye may
not be put to shame by an accusing conscience, but may rejoice and be glad, whilst ye perceive
that ye have accomplished the greatest part of the admonition.</p>
<p>22. Let us not moralize on these things here only. For this temporary admonition does
not suffice to extirpate the whole evil; but at home also, let the husband hear of these things
from the wife, and the wife from the husband. And let there be a kind of rivalry among all
in endeavouring to gain precedence in the fulfilment of this law; and let him who is in advance,
and hath amended his conduct, reproach him who is still loitering behind; to the end
that he may stir him up the more by these gibes. He who is deficient, and hath not yet

same expression receives a most striking commentary.</note>

amended his conduct, let him look at him who hath outstripped him, and strive with emulation
to come up with him quickly. If we take advice on these points, and are anxiously
concerned about them, our other affairs will speedily be well adjusted. Be thou solicitous
about God’s business, and he will take care of thine! And do not say to me, “What if any
one should impose upon us the necessity of taking oaths? What if he should not believe us?”
For assuredly, where a law is transgressed, it is improper to make mention of necessity;
forasmuch as there is but one necessity which cannot be dispensed with, viz. that of not offending
God! This, however, I say further; cut off in the meantime superfluous oaths, those
that are taken uselessly, and without any necessity; those to your own family, those to your
friends, those to your servants; and should you take away these, you will have no further
need of me for the others. For the very mouth that has been well disciplined to dread and
to avoid the frequent oath, should any one constrain it a thousand times, would never consent
to relapse again into the same habit. On the contrary, as now, with much labor and vast
importunity, by alarming, threatening, exhorting, and counselling, we have scarcely been
able to bring it over to a different habit, so in that case, although any one were to impose
ever so great necessity, he could not possibly persuade to a transgression of this law. And
as a person would never choose to take a particular poison, however urgent the necessity
might be, so neither would he to utter an oath!</p>
<p>23. Should this amendment then take place, it will be an encouragement and inducement
to the attainment of the remaining parts of virtue. For he who has not accomplished anything
at all becomes listless, and quickly falls; but he who is conscious with himself that he has
fulfilled at least one precept, coming by this to have a good hope, will go on with greater
alacrity towards the rest; so that, after he has reached one, he will presently come to another;
and will not halt until he has attained the crown of all. For if with regard to wealth, the more
any one obtains of it, the more he desires, much rather may this be seen with reference to
spiritual attainments. Therefore I hasten, and am urgent that this work may take its commencement,
and that the foundation of virtue may be laid in your souls. We pray and beseech,
that ye will remember these words, not only at the present time, but also at home, and in
the market, and wheresoever ye pass your time. Oh! that it were possible for me familiarly
to converse with you!1276 then this long harangue of mine would have been unnecessary.
But now since this may not be, instead of me, remember my words: and while you are sitting
at table, suppose me to enter, and to be standing beside you, and dinning into you the things
I now say to you in this place. And wheresoever there may be any discourse concerning me
among you, above all things remember this precept, and render me this recompense for my

by the existing calamity. Possibly also to the numbers of his congregation. See the end of the next Homily. In

love toward you. If I see that you have fulfilled it, I have received my full return, and have
obtained a sufficient recompense for my labours. In order then that ye may both render us
the more active, and that yourselves too may be in the enjoyment of a good hope; and may
provide for the accomplishment of the remaining precepts with greater facility; treasure up
this precept in your souls with much care, and ye will then understand the benefit of this
admonition. And since a vestment broidered with gold is a beautiful and conspicuous object,
but seems much more so to us when it is worn upon our own person; thus also the precepts
of God are beautiful when being praised, but appear far more lovely when they are rightly
practised. For now indeed ye commend what is spoken during a brief moment of time, but
if ye reduce it to practice, you will alike commend both yourselves and us all day long, and
all your lives long. And this is not the grand point, that we shall praise one another; but that
God will accept us; and not only accept us, but will also reward us with those gifts that are
great and unspeakable! Of which may we all be deemed worthy, through the grace and lovingkindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom, and with whom, to the Father together
with the Holy Ghost, be glory, now and always, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily VI.</head>
<p>This Homily is intended to shew that the fear of Magistrates is beneficial. It also contains an
account of what occurred, during their journey, to those who were conveying the tidings
of the sedition to the Emperor. The case of Jonah is further cited in illustration. The exhortation
on the fear of death is here continued; and it is shewn, that he who suffers unjustly,
and yet gives thanks to God, by whose permission it happens, is as one suffering for
God’s sake. Examples are again adduced from the history of the Three Children, and the
Babylonian furnace. The Homily concludes with an address on the necessity of abstaining
from oaths.</p>
<p>1. We have spent many days addressing words of comfort to your Charity. We would
not, however, on that account lay the subject aside; but as long as the sore of despondency
remains, we will apply to it the medicine of consolation. For if in the case of bodily wounds,
physicians do not give over their fomentations, until they perceive that the pain has subsided;
much less ought this to be done in regard to the soul. Despondency is a sore of the soul; and
we must therefore foment it continually with soothing words. For not so naturally is warm
water efficacious to soften a hard tumour of the flesh, as words of comfort are powerful to
allay the swelling passions of the soul.1277 Here, there is no need of the sponge as with
physician, but instead of this we employ the tongue. No need of fire here, that we may warm
the water; but instead of fire, we make use of the grace of the Spirit. Suffer us then to do so
to-day. For if we were not to comfort you, where else could ye obtain consolation? The
judges affright; the priests therefore must console! The rulers threaten; therefore must the
Church give comfort! Thus it happens with respect to little children. The teachers frighten
them, and send them away weeping to their mothers; but the mothers receiving them back
to their own bosoms, keep them there, embrace them, and kiss them, while they wipe away
their tears, and relieve their sorrowing spirits; persuading them by what they say, that it is
profitable for them to fear their teachers. Since therefore the rulers also make you afraid,
and render you anxious, the Church, which is the common mother of us all, opening her
bosom, and cradling us in her arms, administers daily consolation; telling us that the fear
of rulers is profitable, and profitable too the consolation that comes from hence.1278 For
the fear of the former does not permit us to be relaxed by listlessness, but the consolation
of the latter does not allow us to sink under the weight of sadness; and by both these means
God provides for our safety. He Himself hath armed magistrates with power; that they may
strike terror into the licentious; and hath ordained His priests that they may administer
consolation to those that are in sorrow.</p>
<note type="footnote">1277 S. Ign. ad Pol. c. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">1278 i.e., from the Church.</note>

<pb n="542"/>
<p>2. And both these things are taught us by the Scripture, and by actual experience of recent
events. For if, whilst there are magistrates and soldiers living under arms, the madness of a
few individuals, a motley crew of adventurers, hath kindled such a fire among us, in so short
a moment1279 of time, and raised such a tempest, and made us all to stand in fear of shipwreck,
suppose the fear of magistrates to be wholly taken away? To what lengths would they
not have gone in their madness? Would they not have overthrown the city from its foundations,
turning all things upside down, and have taken our very lives? If you were to abolish
the public tribunals, you would abolish all order from our life. And even as if you deprive
the ship of its pilot, you sink the vessel; or as, if you remove the general from the army, you
place the soldiers bound in the hands of the enemy; so if you deprive the city of its rulers,
we must lead a life less rational than that of the brutes, biting and devouring one another;
the rich man, the poorer; the stronger man, the weaker; and the bolder man, him who is
more gentle. But now by the grace of God none of these things happen. For they who live
in a state of piety, require no correction on the part of the magistrates; for “the law is not
made for a righteous man,”1280 saith one. But the more numerous being viciously inclined,
if they had no fear of these hanging over them, would fill the cities with innumerable evils;
which Paul knowing, observed, “There is no power, but of God, the powers that be are ordained
of God.”1281 For what the tie-beams1282 are in houses, that rulers are in cities; and
in the same manner as if you were to take away the former, the walls, being disunited, would
fall in upon one another of their own accord; so were you to deprive the world of magistrates,
and of the fear that comes of them, houses at once, and cities, and nations, would fall on
one another in unrestrained confusion, there being no one to repress, or repel, or persuade
them to be peaceful, by the fear of punishment!</p>
<p>3. Let us not then be grieved, beloved, by the fear of our rulers, but let us give thanks to
God that He hath removed our listlessness, and rendered us more diligent. For tell me, what
harm hath arisen from this concern and anxiety? Is it that we are become more grave, and
gentle; more diligent, and attentive? that we see no one intoxicated, and singing lascivious
airs? Or is it that there are continual supplications,1283 and prayers, and tears? that unseasonable
laughter, and impure words, and all dissoluteness is banished; and that the city is now
in all respects, like the pattern of a modest and virtuous woman? Dost thou grieve, I ask,
for any of these reasons? For these things, assuredly, it were right to rejoice, and to be
thankful to God, that by the terror of a few days He hath put an end to such stupidity!</p>

<p>“Very true,” saith some one, “if our danger did not go beyond fear, we should have
reaped a sufficient benefit; but we are now in dread lest the mischief should proceed much
farther, and we should be all placed in the extremest peril.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I say, fear not. Paul comforteth you, saying, “God is faithful, who will not
suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able, but will with the temptation also make the
way of escape, that ye may be able to bear it.”1284 He indeed Himself hath said, “I will never
leave thee, nor forsake thee.”1285 For had He resolved to punish us in deed, and in actual
endurance, He would not have given us over to terror during so many days. For when He
would not punish, He affrights; since if He were intending to punish, fear would be superfluous,
and threatening superfluous. But now, we have sustained a life more grievous than
countless deaths; fearing and trembling during so many days, and being suspicious of our
very shadows; and paying the punishment of Cain; and in the midst of our sleep, starting
up, through constant agony of mind. So that if we have kindled God’s wrath, we have appeased
Him in the endurance of such a punishment. For if we have not paid the satisfaction
due to our sins, yet it hath been enough to satisfy the mercy of God.</p>
<p>4. But not this, but many other grounds for confidence ought we to have. For God hath
already given us not a few pledges for favourable hopes. And first of all, those who carried
the evil tidings departing hence with the speed of wings, supposing they should long ere
this have reached the camp,1286 are yet delayed in the midst of their journey. So many
hindrances and impediments have arisen; and they have left their horses, and are now proceeding
in vehicles; whence their arrival must of necessity be retarded. For since God here
stirred up our priest, and common father, and persuaded him to go forth, and undertake
this embassy, he detained the messengers for a while, when they were but half way on their
road, lest arriving before him they might kindle the fire, and make our teacher’s efforts to
mend matters useless, when the royal ears had become inflamed. For that this hindrance
on the road, was not without God’s interposition is evident from this. Men who had been
familiar with such journeys all their lives, and whose constant business it was to ride on
horseback, now broke down through the fatigue of this very riding; so that what hath now
happened is the reverse of what took place in the case of Jonah. For God hastened him when

The term is accounted for by the acknowledged dependence of the Emperors on the army, and their constantly
having a strong guard about them. Compare our expression, “head-quarters” to denote the seat of government.

unwilling, to go on his mission. But these, who were desirous to go, He hindered. O strange
and wonderful event! He wished not to preach of an overthrow; and God forced him to
go1287 against his will. These men with much haste set forward to be the bearers of a message
of overthrow, and against their will again He has hindered them! For what reason think
you? Why, because in this case the haste was an injury; but in the other case, haste brought
gain. On this account, He hastened him forward by means of the whale; and detained these
by means of their horses. Seest thou the wisdom of God? Through the very means by which
each party hoped to accomplish their object, through these each received an hindrance. Jonah
expected to escape by the ship, and the ship became his chain. These couriers, by means of
their horses, expected the more quickly to see the Emperor; and the horses became the
obstacles; or rather, neither the horses in one case, nor the ship in the other, but the
Providence of God everywhere directing all things according to its own wisdom!</p>
<p>5. Consider also His care over us, and how He both affrighted and consoled us. For after
permitting them to set out on the very day when all these outrages were committed, as if
they would report all that had taken place to the Emperor; He alarmed us all at their sudden
departure. But when they were gone, and two or three days had elapsed, and we thought
the journey of our Priest would now be useless, as he would arrive when it was too late, He
delivered us from this fear, and comforted us by detaining them, as I observed, midway;
and by providing persons coming to us from thence by the same road, to announce to us
all the difficulties they had met with on their journey, that we might thus take a little breath,
as indeed we did, and were relieved of a great part of our anxiety. Having heard of this, we
adored God who had done it, who hath even now more tenderly than any father disposed
all things for us, delaying by some invisible power those evil messengers, and all but saying
to them, “Why do ye hasten? Why do ye press on, when ye are going to overwhelm so great
a city? For are ye the bearers of a good message to the Emperor? Wait there till I have made
ready my servant, as an excellent physician, to come up with you and anticipate you in your
course.” But if there was so much of providential care in the first breaking out of this wound
of iniquity, much more shall we obtain a greater freedom from anxiety, after conversion,
after repentance, after so much fear, after tears and prayers. For Jonah was very properly
constrained, in order that he might be forcibly brought to repentance; but ye have already
given striking evidences of repentance, and conversion. Therefore, it is necessary that you
should receive consolation, instead of a threatening messenger. For this reason also hath
He sent our common father hence, notwithstanding the many things to hinder it. But if He
had not been tender of our safety, He would not have persuaded him to this, but would have
hindered him, however disposed he might be to undertake the journey.</p>

<p>6. There is a third reason by which I may possibly persuade you to have confidence; I
mean, the present sacred season,1288 which almost all, even unbelievers, respect; but to
which this our divinely-favoured Emperor has shewn such reverence and honour, as to
surpass all the Emperors who have reigned with a regard for religion before him. As a proof
of this, by sending a letter on these days in honour of the feast, he liberated nearly all those
who were lodged in prison; and this letter our Priest when he arrives will read to him; and
remind him of his own laws, and will say to him, “Do thou exhort thyself, and remember
thine own deeds! Thou hast an example for thy philanthropy at home! Thou didst choose
to forbear from executing a justifiable slaughter, and wilt thou endure to perpetrate one that
is unjust. Reverencing the feast, thou didst discharge those who had been convicted and
condemned; and wilt thou, I ask, condemn the innocent, and those who have not committed
any violence, and this when the sacred season is present? That be far from thee, O Emperor!
Thou, speaking by this Epistle to all the cities, didst say, ‘Would it were possible for me to
raise even the dead.’ This philanthropy and these words we now stand in need of. To conquer
enemies, doth not render kings so illustrious, as to conquer wrath and anger; for in the
former case, the success is due to arms and soldiers; but here the trophy is simply thine own,
and thou hast no one to divide with thee the glory of thy moral wisdom. Thou hast overcome
barbarian war, overcome also Imperial wrath! Let all unbelievers learn that the fear of Christ
is able to bridle every kind of authority. Glorify thy Lord by forgiving the trespasses of thy
fellow-servants; that He also may glorify thee the more; that at the Day of Judgment, He
may bend on thee an Eye merciful and serene, being mindful of this thy lovingkindness!”
This, and much more, he will say, and will assuredly rescue us from the Emperor’s wrath.
And not only will this fast be of the greatest assistance to us in influencing the Emperor in
our favour, but also towards enduring what befalls us with fortitude; for we reap no small
consolation from this season. For our very meeting together daily as we do, and having the
benefit of hearing the divine Scriptures; and beholding each other; and weeping with each
other; and praying, and receiving Benedictions,1289 and so departing home, takes off the
chief part of our distress.</p>
<note type="footnote">1288 Tillemont, Theodos. art. vi., mentions a law of his against holding criminal processes in Lent, and one
deferring all executions thirty days. The massacre of Thessalonica, for which St. Ambrose caused him to do
penance, occurred after the date of these Homilies, and that event forms a striking comment on Hom. III. 6. St.
Ambrose then required him to renew the last-mentioned law.</note>

distinct from the Eucharist (being the residue of that brought for consecration), which was given to those who</note>

<p>7. Let us, therefore, not despond, nor give ourselves up by reason of our distress; but
let us wait, expecting a favourable issue; and let us give heed to the things that are now about
to be spoken. For it is my purpose to discourse to you again to day respecting contempt for
death. I said to you, yesterday, that we are afraid of death, not because he is really formidable;
but because the love of the kingdom hath not kindled us, nor the fear of hell laid hold of us;
and because besides this we have not a good conscience. Are you desirous that I should
speak of a fourth reason for this unseasonable distress, one which is not less,1290 and truer
than the rest? We do not live with the austerity that becometh Christians. On the contrary,
we love to follow this voluptuous and dissolute and indolent life; therefore also it is but
natural that we cleave to present things; since if we spent this life in fastings, vigils, and
poverty of diet, cutting off all our extravagant desires; setting a restraint upon our pleasures;
undergoing the toils of virtue; keeping the body under1291 like Paul, and bringing it into
subjection; not “making provision for the lusts of the flesh;”1292 and pursuing the strait and
narrow way, we should soon be earnestly desirous of future things, and eager to be delivered
from our present labours. And to prove that what I say is not untrue, ascend to the tops of
the mountains, and observe the monks who are there; some in sackcloth; some in bonds;
some in fastings; some shut up1293 in darkness. Thou wilt then perceive, that all these are
earnestly desiring death, and calling it rest. For even as the pugilist is eager to leave the stadium,
in order that he may be freed from wounds; and the wrestler longs for the theatre to
break up, that he may be released from his toils; so also he who by the aid of virtue leads a
life of austerity, and mortification, earnestly longs for death in order that he may be freed
from his present labours, and may be able to have full assurance in regard to the crowns
laid up in store, by arriving in the still harbour, and migrating to the place where there is

from the Apostolic phraseology, τὸ ποτήριον τῆς εὐλογίας, 1 Cor. x. 16. It is used in the plural, for portions of
the consecrated bread, both at communion, and when reserved to be sent to the sick, or to other churches.</note>
<note type="footnote">1290 M. (and Ben. and Bas. Tr. apparently) read οὐκ žλαττον τῶν προτ™ρων ‡ληθεστ™ραν; “not less the true

some copies of the text and commentators, and among them St. Chrysostom ad loc., but this has less authority

no further apprehension of shipwreck. Therefore, also, hath God provided for us a life that
is naturally laborious and troublesome; to the end that being here urged by tribulation, we
may conceive an eager longing for future blessings; for if now, whilst there are so many
sorrows, and dangers, and fears, and anxieties, surrounding us on all sides, we thus cling to
the present life; when should we ever be desirous of the life to come, if our present existence
were altogether void of grief and misery?</p>
<p>8. Thus also God acted towards the Jews. For wishing to infuse into them a desire of
returning (to Canaan), and to persuade them to hate Egypt, He permitted them to be distressed
by working in clay, and brick-making, that being oppressed by that weight of toil
and affliction, they might cry unto God respecting their return. For if, indeed when they
departed after these things had happened, they did again remember Egypt, with their hard
slavery, and were urgent to turn back to that former tyranny; what if they had received no
such treatment from these barbarians? when would they have ever wished to leave that
strange land?1294 To the end, therefore, that we may not be too closely attached to the earth,
and grow wretched whilst gaping after present things, and become unmindful of futurity,
God hath made our lives here full of labour. Let us not then cherish the love of the present
life beyond what is necessary. For what doth it profit us? or what is the advantage of being
closely rivetted to the desire of this present state? Art thou willing to learn in what respect
this life is advantageous? It is so, inasmuch as it is the ground-work and starting point of
the life to come; the wrestling-school and the arena for crowns of victory hereafter! so that
if it does not provide these for us, it is worse than a thousand deaths. For if we do not wish
to live so as to please God, it is better to die. For what is the gain? What have we the more?
Do we not every day see the same sun, and the same moon, the same winter, the same
summer, the same course of things? “The thing that hath been, shall be; and that which is
done, is that which shall be done.”1295 Let us not then at once pronounce those happy, who
are alive, and bewail the dead, but let us weep for those who are in their sins, whether they
be dead or alive. And on the other hand, let us call those happy in whatsoever condition
they be, who are in a state of righteousness. Thou, forsooth, fearest and lamentest “one”
death; but Paul, who was dying daily,1296 was so far from shedding a tear on that account,
that he rejoiced and exulted!</p>
<p>9. “O that I did endure the peril for God,” saith some one, “then I should have no anxiety!”
But do not even now sink into despondency; for not only indeed is he well approved,
who suffers in the cause of God: but he who is suffering any thing unjustly:1297 and bearing

it nobly, and giving thanks to God who permits it, is not inferior to him who sustains these
trials for God’s sake. The blessed Job is a proof of this, who received so many intolerable
wounds through the devil’s plotting against him uselessly, vainly, and without cause. Yet,
nevertheless, because he bore them courageously, and gave thanks to God who permitted
them, he was invested with a perfect1298 crown. Be not sad then on account of death; for it
is natural to die: but grieve for sin; because it is a fault of the will. But if thou grievest for
the dead, mourn also for those who are born into the world; for as the one thing is of nature,
so is the other too of nature. Should any one, therefore, threaten thee with death, say to him,
“I am instructed by Christ not to ‘fear them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the
soul.’”1299 Or should he threaten thee with the confiscation of thy goods, say to him, “Naked
came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither. We brought nothing
into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.”1300 “And though thou take me
not, death will come and take me; and though thou slay me not, yet the law of nature will
presently interfere and bring the end.” Therefore we should fear none of these things which
are brought on us by the order of nature, but those which are engendered by our own evil
will; for these bring forth our penalty. But let us continually consider this, that as regards
the events which come upon us unexpectedly we shall not mend them by grieving, and so
we shall cease to grieve.</p>
<p>10. And moreover we should think of this again, that if we suffer any evil unjustly,
during the present life, we discharge a multitude of sins. Therefore it is a great advantage
to have out the chastisement of our sins here, and not there; for the rich man received no
evil here, and therefore he was scorched in the flames there; and that this was the reason
why he did not enjoy any consolation,1301 hear in proof what Abraham saith, “Son, thou
hast received thy good things; therefore thou art tormented.” But that to the good things
bestowed on Lazarus, not only his virtue, but his having here suffered a thousand ills, contributed,
learn also from the patriarch’s words. For having said to the rich man, “Thou hast
received1302 thy good things,” he goes on to say, “and Lazarus evil things, and for this reason
he is comforted.”1303 For as they who live virtuously, and are afflicted, receive a double reward
from God, so he who liveth in wickedness, and fares sumptuously, shall have a double
punishment. Again, I declare this not for the purpose of accusing those who have taken

flight, for it is said, “Add not more trouble to a heart that is vexed;”1304 nor do I say it because
I wish to rebuke; (for the sick man stands in need of consolation); but for the purpose of
endeavouring to promote an amendment. Let us not entrust our safety to flight, but flee
from sins, and depart from our evil way. If we escape from these things, although we be in
the midst of ten thousand soldiers; not one of them will be able to smite us; but not flying
from these, though we ascend to the very summit of the mountains, we shall there find innumerable
enemies! Let us again call to mind those three children, who were in the midst
of the furnace, yet suffered no evil, and those who cast them into it, how they that sat around
were all consumed. What is more wonderful than this? The fire freed those it held possession
of, and violently seized those whom it did not hold, to teach thee, that not the habitation,
but the habit of life, bringeth safety or punishment. Those within the furnace escaped, but
those without were consumed. To each alike were the same bodies, but not the same dispositions.
1305 For this reason neither were the effects on them the same; for hay, although it lie
without the flame, is quickly kindled; but gold, although it remain within, becomes the more
resplendent!</p>
<p>11. Where now are those who said, “Let the Emperor take all, and grant us our bodies
free?” Let such go and learn what is a free body. It is not immunity from punishment that
makes the body free, but perseverance in a life of righteousness. The bodies of these youths,
for instance, were free, though they were given over to the furnace, because they had before
put off the slavery of sin. For this alone is liberty; and not an immunity from punishment,
or from suffering anything fearful. But having heard of the furnace, call thou to mind the
“rivers of fire,”1306 which there shall be in that fearful day. For as on the above occasion,
the fire seized upon some, but reverenced others, so also shall it be with those rivers. If any
one should then have hay, wood, stubble, he increases1307 the fire; but if he has gold and
silver, he1308 becomes the brighter. Let us therefore get together this kind of material, and
let us bear the present state of things nobly; knowing that this tribulation will both bring us
deliverance from that punishment if we understand how to practise true wisdom,1309 and

will also make us better here; and not only us, but often those too, who throw us into trouble,
if we be vigilant; so abundant is the force of this spiritual wisdom; which was the case then
even with the tyrant. For when he knew that they had suffered no harm, hear how he changed
his language. “Ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither.”1310 Didst
not thou say, a little before “Who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?”1311
What hath happened? Whence this change? Thou sawest those without destroyed, and dost
thou call on those within? Whence hath it come to pass that thou art grown wise in such
matters. Thou seest how great a change took place in the monarch! Whilst he had not yet
exercised his power over them, he blasphemed, but as soon as he had cast them into fire,
he began to shew moral wisdom. For this reason also God permitted all to take place,
whatsoever the tyrant wished, in order that He might make it manifest, that none will be
able to injure those who are kept by Him. And what He did towards Job, He performed
here. For on that occasion also, He permitted the devil to manifest all his power; and not
till he had exhausted all his darts, and no further mode of plotting against him remained,
was the combatant led out of the field, that the victory might be brilliant and indubitable.
So here too He did the very same thing. He willed to overthrow their city, and God stayed
him not: he willed to carry them away captive, and He hindered him not: he willed to bind
them, and He permitted; to cast them into the furnace, and He allowed it: to heat the flame
beyond its measure, and this too He suffered; and when there was nothing further left for
the tyrant to do, and he had exhausted all his strength, then God manifested His own power,
and the patience of the youths. Seest thou how God permitted these tribulations even to the
end, that He might shew the assailants the spiritual wisdom of those whom they assailed,
as well as His own providence. Both of which circumstances also that man then discerned,
and cried out, “Ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and come hither.”</p>
<p>12. But consider thou with me the magnanimity of the youths; for they neither sprang
out before the call, lest some should suppose they feared the fire; nor when they were called
did they remain within, lest any one should think that they were ambitious and contentious.
“As soon,” say they, “as thou hast learnt whose servants we are, as soon as thou hast acknowledged
our Lord, we come forth to be heralds to all who are present of the power of God.”
Or rather, not only they themselves, but even the enemy with his own voice, yea, both orally,
and by his epistle, proclaimed to all men both the constancy of the combatants, and the
strength of Him who presided over the contest. And even as the heralds, when they proclaim
the names of the victorious combatants in the midst of the theatre, mention also the cities
to which they belong; “such an one, of such a city!” So he too, instead of their city, proclaimed
their Lord, by saying, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high

God, come forth, and come hither.” What is come to pass, that thou callest them the servants
of God? Were they not thy servants? “Yea,” saith he, “but they have overthrown1312 my
sovereignty; they have trampled under foot my pride. They have shown by deeds, that He
is their true Lord. If they were the servants of men, the fire would not have feared them; the
flame would not have made way for them; for the creation knows nothing of reverencing
or honoring the servants of men.” Therefore again he saith, “Blessed be the God of Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego.”</p>
<p>13. Contemplate with me also, how first he proclaims the Arbiter of the contest. “Blessed
be God, who hath sent His angel and delivered His servants.”1313 This of the power of God.
He speaks also of the virtue of the combatants. “Because they trusted in Him, and have
changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not worship any
god except their own God.” Could anything equal the virtue of this? Before this, when they
said, “We will not serve thy gods,” he was inflamed more fiercely than the very furnace; but
now, when by their deeds they had taught him this, he was so far from being indignant, that
he praised and admired them, for not having obeyed him! So good a thing is virtue, that it
has even its enemies themselves to applaud and admire it! These had fought and conquered,
but the vanquished party gave thanks, that the sight of the fire had not terrified them, but
that the hope in their Lord had comforted them. And He names the God of the whole world
after the three youths, not at all circumscribing His sovereignty, but inasmuch as these three
youths were equivalent to the whole world.1314 For this reason he both applauds those who
had despised him, and passing by so many governors, kings, and princes, those who had
obeyed him, he stands in admiration of the three captives and slaves, who derided his
tyranny! For they did these things, not for the sake of contention, but for the love of wisdom;
not of defiance, but of devotion; not as being puffed up with pride, but fired with zeal. For
great indeed is the blessing of a hope in God; which then also the barbarian learned, and
making it manifest that it was from that source they had escaped the impending peril, he
exclaimed aloud: “Because they trusted in Him!”1315</p>
<p>14. But I say all this now, and select all the histories that contain trials and tribulations,
and the wrath of kings, and their evil designs, in order that we may fear nothing, save only
offending God. For then also was there a furnace burning; yet they derided it, but feared
sin. For they knew that if they were consumed in the fire, they should suffer nothing that
was to be dreaded; but that if they were guilty of impiety, they should undergo the extremes
of misery. It is the greatest punishment to commit sin, though we may remain unpunished;

as on the other hand, it is the greatest honour and repose to live virtuously, though we may
be punished. For sins separate us from God; as He Himself speaks; “Have not your sins
separated between you and Me?”1316 But punishments lead us back to God. As one saith,
“Give peace; for Thou hast recompensed us for all things.”1317 Suppose any one hath a
wound; which is the most deserving of fear, gangrene, or the surgeon’s knife? the steel, or
the devouring progress of the ulcer? Sin is a gangrene, punishment is the surgeon’s knife.
As then, he who hath a gangrene, although he is not lanced, hath to sustain the malady, and
is then in the worse condition, when he is not lanced; so also the sinner, though he be not
punished, is the most wretched of men; and is then especially wretched, when he hath no
punishment, and is suffering no distress. And as those who have a disease of the spleen, or
a dropsy, when they enjoy a plentiful table, and cool drinks, and a variety of delicacies, and
condiments, are then especially in a most pitiable state, increasing as they do their disease
by luxury; but should they rigorously subject themselves to hunger and thirst, according to
medical laws, they might have some hope of recovery; so also those who live in iniquity, if
they are punished, may have favourable hopes; but if, together with their wickedness, they
enjoy security and luxury, they become more wretched than those who cram their bellies,
though they are in a state of dropsy; and so much the more, as the soul is better than the
body. If then thou seest any who are in the same sins, and some of them struggling continually
with hunger, and a thousand ills; while others are drinking their fill, and living sumptuously,
and gormandizing; think those the better off, who endure sufferings. For not only is the
flame of voluptuousness cut off by these misfortunes, but they also depart to the future
Judgment, and that dread tribunal,1318 with no small relief; and go hence, having discharged
here the penalty of the greater part of their sins by the ills they have suffered.</p>

<note type="footnote">1318 It was the common opinion of the Greek Fathers, that the fire of the day of judgment would cause severe
suffering to some of those who would be finally saved, and that this might be mitigated by a severe repentance,

which to be judged, fears not Hell, dreads not Judgment. It abides free from fear and astonishment, no evil conscience
causing a fear of Judgment.” However, St. Chrys. on 1 Cor. iii. 15, Hom. IX. explains the being saved as
by fire of remaining undestroyed in eternal torment. This last exposition is attributed to “the Greeks” by Bellarmine,
de Purg. lib. i. c. 5, having been defended by them in the discussion on Purgatory preliminary to the
Council of Florence. Labbe, t. xiii. p. 26–30. It is also held by Photius, OEcum. ad loc. Theodoret, on 1 Cor. iii.,</note>

<p>15. But enough of consolation. It is time for us now, at last, to proceed to the exhortation
on the subject of avoiding oaths, and to remove that seeming palliation on behalf of those
who swear, which is but futile,1319 and useless. For when we bring an accusation against
them, they allege the case of others who do the very same thing; and they say, “such and
such persons swear.” Let us then say to these, Nevertheless; such a man does not swear: and
God will give His judgment concerning thee, from those who do good works; for sinners
do not profit sinners by fellowship in transgressions; but they who perform what is right
condemn sinners.1320 For they who gave not Christ food, or drink, were many; but they
rendered no aid to each other.1321 Similar also was the case of the five virgins, who found
no pardon from companionship,1322 but being condemned by a comparison with those
who had acted wisely, both these and the former were alike punished.</p>
<p>16. Dismissing then this argument of frigid self-deception, let us not look at the case of
those who fall, but at those who fashion their conduct rightly; and let us endeavour to carry
along with us a memento of the present fast when it is over. And as it often happens when
we have purchased a vestment, or a slave, or a precious vase, we recall again the time when
we did so, and say to each other, “That slave I purchased at such a festival; that garment I
bought at such a time;” so, in like manner, if we now reduce to practice this law, we shall
say, I reformed the practice of swearing during that Lent; for till then I was a swearer; but
from barely hearing an admonition, I have abstained from the sin.</p>
<p>But “the custom,” it may be objected, “is a hard thing to be reformed.” I know it is; and
therefore am urgent to throw you into another custom, which is good and profitable. For
when you say, it is difficult for me to abstain from what is habitual; for that very reason, I

trial of the teacher’s own life. Euseb. (quoted as Emisen. really a Gall. Bp. of later date), Bibl. Pat. Col. iii. 549,
speaks of rivers of fire (see p. 126); Hom. III. de Epiph., OEcumenius on 1 Cor. iii. (doubtfully). Also the Commentary
on Isaiah, attributed to St. Basil, on c. ix. 19; Ben. t. i. p. 554 (cited as his by Photius), speak of a
cleansing by the Judgment fire. Origen, on Ps. xxxvi. (37) 14, Hom. III. 1, says, “And, as I think, we must all
come to that fire. Though one be Paul or Peter, yet he comes to that fire.” So St. Ambr. on verse 15, sec. 26, of
Ezekiel and Daniel, and St. Hil. on Ps. cxviii. (119) 20, of the Blessed Virgin herself, so applying Luc. ii. 35. See
Cat. Aur. on St. Matt. iii. 11, 12, Tr. p. 104, note e. St. Greg. Naz. Or. xxxix. c. 19, speaks of Novatians, as “perhaps
to be baptized in the fire of the other world, in that last Baptism, which is longer and more painful.” There is
no minutely defined and universal doctrine on the subject. See on Fleury, b. 19, c. 31.</note>

say, you should make haste to abstain, knowing for certain, that if you once1323 make another
custom for yourself of not swearing, you will want no labour afterwards. Which is the more
difficult thing; not to swear, or to remain the whole day without food; and to shrivel up1324
on water-drinking, and meagre diet? It is evident that the latter surpasses the former; yet,
notwithstanding, custom has made this matter so possible and easy of execution, that when
the fast comes round, although any one should exhort a thousand times, or as frequently
constrain and compel one to partake of wine, or taste of any other of those things which are
forbidden during fasts, yet a man would prefer to suffer anything, rather than touch the
prohibited article of food;1325 and that not for want of relish for the table, nevertheless, we
bear it all with fortitude, from the habit of our conscience. And the case will be the same in
regard to oaths; and just as if now, any one were to impose ever so great necessity, you would
remain immovable, holding fast the habit;1326 so also in that case, if any one should urge
you ten thousand times, you would not depart from your custom.</p>
<p>18. When you go home, therefore, discourse of all these things with those who are in
your house; and as many persons often do, when they come back from a meadow, having
plucked there a rose, or a violet, or some flower of that kind, they return twisting1327 it
about with their fingers; and as some, again, when they quit the gardens to go home, take
with them branches of trees, with their fruit upon them; and as others, moreover, from
sumptuous feasts, carry away leavings of the entertainment for their dependents; so indeed
do thou, departing from hence, take an exhortation home to thy wife, thy children, and all
thine household. For this admonition is more profitable than the meadow, the garden, or
the banquetting table. These roses never wither; these fruits never drop off; these dainties
never corrupt. The former yield a temporary delight; but the latter a lasting advantage, not
only after this reformation has taken place, but in the very act of reforming. For think what
a good practice this would be, having dismissed all other matters public or private, to dis-
course1328 only of the divine laws continually, at the table, in the forum, and in your other
meetings. Would we give our attention to these things, we should say nothing of a dangerous
or injurious nature, nor should we sin unwittingly. Giving our leisure to discourse respecting

these things, we should be able to withdraw our soul even from this despondency that hangs
over us, instead of looking with so much anxiety as we do, whilst we say one to another,
“Hath the Emperor heard what hath happened? Is he incensed? What sentence hath he
pronounced?1329 Hath any one petitioned him? What? Will he himself endure to destroy
utterly a city so great and populous?” Casting these and all such cares upon God, let us be
anxious only as to what He hath commanded! Thus shall we rid ourselves of all these sorrows;
and although ten only among us should succeed, the ten would quickly become twenty; the
twenty fifty; the fifty a hundred; the hundred a thousand; the thousand all the city. And just
as when ten lamps are lighted, one may easily fill the whole house with light, so also with
respect to right actions; should only ten act rightly, we shall light up a general flame
throughout the city, to shine forth, and to procure us safety. For not so naturally does the
fire, when it falls upon a forest, kindle the neighbouring trees successively, as will the emulation
for virtue, when it seizes upon a few minds, be mighty in its progress to diffuse itself
through the whole community.</p>
<p>19. Give me cause, then, to exult over you both in the present life, and at that future
Day, when those to whom talents have been entrusted, shall be summoned! Your good
reputation is a sufficient reward for my labours; and if I see you living in piety, I have all I
wish. Do, then, what yesterday I recommended, and to-day will repeat, and will not cease
to say it. Fix a penalty for those who swear; a penalty which is a gain, and not a loss; and
prepare yourselves henceforth so as you may give us a proof of success. For I shall endeavour
to hold a long conversation with each of you, when this assembly is dismissed; in order that
in the continuance of discourse I may discover the persons who have been acting rightly,
and those who have not.1330 And if I find any one still swearing, I shall make him manifest
to all who are amended, that by reproving, rebuking, and correcting, we may quickly deliver
him from this evil habit. For better it is that he should amend through being reproached
here, than that he should be put to shame, and punished, in the presence of the whole assembled
universe, on that Day, when our sins shall be revealed to the eyes of all men! But
God forbid that any in this fair assembly should appear there suffering such things! but by
the prayers of the holy fathers,1331 correcting all our offences, and having shown forth the
abundant fruit of virtue, may we depart hence with much confidence, through the grace

by its agreement with Hom. XLIV. on Gen. xix. 29; Ben. iv. 448, 449. But there is a difficulty in it owing to the
reference to St. Paul’s departure. This may be explained as a turn of rhetoric. The passage on Gen. xix. does not</note>

<pb n="556"/>
<note type="footnote">define whether saints on earth or above are spoken of; but from others it is probable he means the latter. The
close of the Homily on St. Meletius, Ben. ii. 522, A. speaks of such intercession, and that of Hom. in SS. Bernicen
and Prosd. Ben. ii. 645, D. of invoking it. The Homily quoted above, on the intercession of Abraham, warns men
against trusting to prayers of saints so as to neglect their own life. An expression like that in the text occurs in
a Homily de Sp. Sancto, attributed to St. Chrys. by Photius, Ben. iii. 799, C.; Origen on Cant. ii. 5, asserts the
intercession of the saints, proving it from 2 Mac. xv. 14, and on Numb. xxxii., Hom. XXVI. 6, he asks, who
doubts it? Hom. I. 7, on Ezekiel, he invokes an angel, as holding that angels are present, though in a rhetorical
way. Lib. 2, in Job (fin.) sometimes cited as his, is spurious, and the Com. on Lament. doubtful, and the manner
of invocation looks as if of later date. St. Cyprian, Ep. 57, ad Cornel. fin. desires that whoever dies first may pray
for the other; and de Hab. Virg. fin. makes a similar request: and so Theodosia in Euseb. de Mart. Pal. c. 7. In
the fourth century, the invocation of departed saints, or prayer to God for their prayers, becomes common. So Eusebius,
on Ps. lxxviii. (79) takes verse 11, Preserve Thou the sons of the slain (Heb. of death), i.e., of the martyrs. At the close of
his Com. on Isaiah, he prays just as St. Chrys. in the text. St. Athanas. ad Marcellin. 31, t. i. p. 1001, says we should sing
the Psalms exactly, “that the inspired writers may know their own words, and pray with us, or rather, that the Holy
Spirit who spoke in them, hearing the words He dictated to them, may take our part” (συναντιλ€βηται, Comp. Rom. viii.
26). A direct address to the Blessed Virgin.....“Queen, and Mother of God, intercede for us!” is quoted as his (Serm. in
Annunt. t. ii. p. 401), but is spurious, as is there stated. St. James, of Nisibis, Ser. 4, p. 72, seems to speak of an angel
presenting our prayers, which his editor connects with Tertullian’s Angelus Orationis, de Or. xii. and Tob. xii. 12. St.
Hilary, on Ps. cxxiv. (125) 2, takes the hills (as others constantly elsewhere), for the saints and angels. On Matt. xxv. p.
736, he says, “none shall be helped by another’s works and merits, because every one must buy oil for his own lamp.”
This seems to imply the existence of the same tendency which St. Chrysostom reproves, as quoted above on Gen. xix.
The Martyr Justina, early in this century, is said by St. Greg. Naz. Or. xviii. p. 279 (Ben. Or. xxiv. 11, p. 443 d.), to have
implored the aid of the Virgin Mary. In the latter part of the century, instances are more frequent. St. Cyril of Jerusalem,
Cat. Myst. v. (6), says, “Then we commemorate also those who have fallen asleep before us, first, patriachs, prophets,
apostles, martyrs, that at their prayers and intervention God would receive our petition.” St. Basil, Hom. on the Forty
Martyrs, c. 8, t. 2, p. 155, speaks strongly of the value of their intercession, and recommends asking it. “Here is found a
pious woman praying for her children, the return of her husband, his recovery when sick: let your prayers be made with
the martyrs!” To Julian the Apostate, Ep. 360, al. 205, Ben. iii. 462. “I also receive the holy apostles, prophets, and martyrs,
and call on them to supplication unto God, that through them, that is, through their mediation, the merciful God may
become propitious to me, and a ransom of my sins may be made and granted.” To St. Ambrose, Ep. 197, al. 55, Ben. iii.
288, he speaks of the relics of a martyr as protection to those who kept them. St. Ephraim, in Martyres, t. iii. Gr. Lat. p.
251, has, “Victorious Martyrs, willing sufferers for the love of your God and Saviour, ye that have boldness of speech toward
the Lord Himself; intreat, holy as ye are, for us that are worthless, and sinners, and full of listlessness, that the grace of
Christ may come upon us.” Some prayers to the Blessed Virgin, calling her the only hope of sinners, and giving her the
titles of our Lord, are ascribed to him. Such would stand alone in this age, and long after. But one which has been long
known in Latin (ed. Voss, p. 543), has been generally thought spurious. The last Roman Edition contains more, but even
the mss. from which they are taken seem to ascribe them but doubtfully to him (“Prayers collected from Holy Scripture,
but most of them from St. Ephraim,” U+0026c.), especially as others precede these. He, however, used invocation freely, though</note>

and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom, and with whom, be glory to
the Father together with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<note type="footnote">some allowance must be made for his rich imagination, and his fondness for apostrophe. Thus he apostrophises Faith,
adv. Scrut. Ser. vi. Gr. Lat. iii. 160, 161. “O Faith! I pray Thee adapt Thy vastness to our littleness! for while we may not
see and measure thee, love can neither rest nor be silent!” “Come hither, O Faith, Gift of God to the Holy Church, and
rest in this bosom!” Several spurious passages, as from the Christus Patiens attributed to St. Greg. Naz. l. 2582 (but rejected
and objected to by the Ben. editor), are examined by Mr. Palmer, Letter v. to Dr. Wiseman. The real practice of St. Greg.
Naz. appears in his funeral oration on St. Basil, Or. xx. fin. p. 373 (Ben. xliii. 82, p. 831). “But do thou, O divine and sacred
head, look on us from above, and either remove by the intercessions the thorn in the flesh that chastises us, or persuade
us to bear it with fortitude,”U+0026c. Or. vi. ad Greg. Nyss. p. 140 (Ben. xi. 5, p. 245), he says, that martyrs are “Mediators for
attaining a divine state” (θ™ωσις). St. Chrysostom is of the same date. St. Greg. Nyss. on St. Theodorus, speaks repeatedly
of asking his intercession. “To touch his relics, if any chance give one the opportunity…Then, shedding on them the tear
of piety and affection, as though to the martyr, appearing in full presence, they present their entreaty for intercession;
beseeching him, as an attendant* upon God, and invoking him as one who obtains favors at will,” t. iii. p. 580, and so in
other parts of the oration; and in p. 586, he begs him, if need be, to call his brother-martyrs to his aid. And in the close
of his life of St. Ephraim, he both invokes him, “Remember us all, asking remission for our sins;” and speaks of a person
having invoked his help, in circumstances of danger, with success. St. Ambrose, de Vid. c. 9, says, “The angels are to be
entreated for us, who are given us for our guard; the martyrs are to be entreated, whose patronage we may in a manner
claim by the pledge of their bodies. They can pray for our sins, who have washed in their own blood their own sins, if
such they had.” These are most of the authors alleged down to the end of the fourth century, but in most of the later of
them other passages of the same kind appear. Thus the practice of direct invocation seems to have come in by degrees,
and that chiefly in the course of this century. Some passages relating merely to the intercession of the saints have been
passed over, as they would rather confuse the view of the subject of seeking it. Bellarmine, De Sanctis, l. i. c. 19, and
Coccius, Thesaur. l. v., art. 4, give collections of passages. See on Fleury, Book 19, c. 31, Tr. p. 202, note k. *δορυφόρῳ.

<p>Recapitulation of former exhortations. Sin brought death and grief into the world, and they
tend to its cure. Grief serviceable only for the destruction of sin. Remarks upon the passage,
Gen. 1. 1. “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” It is argued that God’s
forethought for man in the work of creation affords grounds of comfort; and that mercy
is shewn even in chastisement, as in the saying, “Adam, where art thou?” Concluding
admonition on the avoidance of oaths.</p>
<p>1. Yesterday, I discoursed unto your Charity in many words, and upon many subjects;
and if out of this variety, it be not possible for you to retain all, I wish more particularly to
recall to memory the observation, that God hath implanted the affection grief in our natures
for no other reason but because of sin, and He hath made this evident from actual experience.
For whilst we are grieved and distressed through the loss of wealth; or by reason of sickness,
and death, and the other evils that befall us, we not only reap no consolation from our sorrow,
but we also increase the force of these calamities. But if we are in pain and sorrow1332 for
our sins, we diminish the weight of sin; we make that little which is great; and very often
we blot it all out entirely. Ye should continually remember this, I repeat, in order that ye
may mourn for sin only, and for nothing besides; and the additional fact, that sin, though
it brought death and sadness into our life, is again destroyed1333 by both these; which I have
recently made evident. Therefore, let us fear nothing so much as sin and transgression. Let
us not fear punishment, and then we shall escape1334 punishment. Even as the Three Children
were not afraid of the furnace, and so escaped from the furnace. Such indeed it becomes the
servants of God to be. For if those who were brought up under the Old dispensation, when
death was not yet slain,1335 nor his “brazen gates broken down,” nor his “iron bars smitten
in sunder;”1336 so nobly encountered their end,1337 how destitute of all defence or excuse
shall we be, if, after having had the benefit of such great grace, we attain not even to the
same measure of virtue as they did, now when death is only a name, devoid of reality. For
death is nothing more than a sleep, a journey, a migration, a rest, a tranquil haven; an escape
from trouble, and a freedom from the cares of this present life!</p>
<p>2. But here let us dismiss the subject of consolation; it is the fifth day we are engaged in
speaking words of comfort to your Charity, and we might now seem to be troublesome. For

what hath been already said is sufficient for those who give heed; but to those who are
pusillanimous it will be no gain, even though we were to add to what we have said. It is now
time to direct our teaching to the exposition of the Scriptures. For as, if we had said nothing
in reference to the present calamity, one might have condemned us for cruelty, and a want
of humanity; so, were we always discoursing of this, we might justly be condemned for
pusillanimity. Commending then your hearts to God, who is able to speak1338 into your
minds, and to expel all grief from within, let us now take up our accustomed manner of instruction;
and that especially since every exposition of Scripture is matter of comfort and
relief. So that, although we may seem to be desisting from the topic of consolation, we shall
again light upon the same subject by means of Scriptural exposition. For that all Scripture
furnishes consolation to those who give attention to it, I will make manifest to you from its
own evidence.1339 For I shall not go about among the Scripture narratives to search out
certain arguments consolatory; but in order that I may make the proof of the matter which
I have undertaken plainer, we will take in hand the book which has to day been read to us;
and bringing forward, if you will, the introduction and commencement of it, which may
especially seem to present no trace of consolation, but to be altogether foreign to topics of
comfort, I will make that which I affirm evident.</p>
<p>3. What then is this introduction? “In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth,
and the earth was invisible, and unformed,1340 and darkness was upon the face of the
abyss.”1341 Do these words seem to some of you incapable of affording consolation under
distress? Is it not an historical narrative, and an instruction about the creation?</p>
<p>Would you then that I show the consolation that is hidden in this saying? Arouse
yourselves then, and attend with earnestness to the things which are about to be spoken.
For when thou hearest that God made the heaven, the earth, the sea, the air, the waters, the
multitude of stars, the two great lights, the plants, the quadrupeds, the swimming and the
flying animals, and all things without exception which thou seest, for thee, and for thy safety
and honour; dost thou not straightway take comfort and receive this as the strongest proof
of the love of God, when thou thinkest that He produced such a world as this, so fair, so
vast and wonderful, for such a puny being as thyself! When therefore thou hearest that, “In
the beginning God made the heaven and the earth,” run not hastily over the declaration;

but traverse in thy mind the breadth of the earth; and reflect how He hath spread out1342

And this is, indeed, the most marvellous thing, that He gave us not such a world as this in
payment for services done; or as a recompense for good works; but at the very time He
formed us, He honoured our race with this kingdom. For He said, “Let us make man after
our image, and after our likeness.”1344 What is the sense of this, “after our image, and after
our likeness?” The image of government1345 is that which is meant; and as there is no one
in heaven superior to God, so let there be none upon earth superior to man. This then is
one, and the first respect, in which He did him honour; by making him after His own image;
and secondly, by providing us with this principality, not as a payment for services, but
making it entirely the gift of His own love toward man; and thirdly, in that He conferred it
upon us as a thing of nature. For of governments there are some natural, and others which
are elective;—natural as of the lion over the quadrupeds, or as that of the eagle over the
birds; elective, as that of an Emperor over us; for he doth not reign over his fellow-servants
by any natural authority. Therefore it is that he oftentimes loses his sovereignty. For such
are things which are not naturally inherent;1346 they readily admit of change and transposition.
But not so with the lion; he rules by nature over the quadrupeds, as the eagle doth
over birds. The character of sovereignty is, therefore, constantly allotted to his race; and no
lion hath ever been seen deprived of it. Such a kind of sovereignty God bestowed upon us
from the beginning, and set us over all things. And not only in this respect did He confer
honour upon our nature,1347 but also, by the very eminence of the spot in which we were
placed, fixing upon Paradise as our choice dwelling, and bestowing the gift of reason, and
an immortal soul.</p>
<p>4. But I would not speak of these things: for I say that such was the abundance of God’s
care, that we may know His goodness, and His love towards man, not only from the way in
which He hath honoured, but also from the way in which He hath punished us. And this, I
especially exhort you to consider with attention, that God is alike good, not only whilst He
is treating us with honour and beneficence, but also whilst He is punishing and chastising.
And whether we should have to carry on our contest and combat against the heathen, or

against the heretics, respecting the lovingkindness and goodness of God, we shall make His
goodness evident, not only from the cases in which He bestows honour, but also from the
cases in which He inflicts punishment. For if He is good only whilst honouring us, and not
good whilst punishing us, He were but half good. But this is not the case. God forbid! Among
men this may probably happen, when they inflict punishments in anger and passion; but
God being free from passion, whether He exercise kindness, or whether He punish, He is
alike good. Nor less does the threat of hell serve to show His goodness, than the promise of
the kingdom.1348 But how? I answer. If He had not threatened hell, if He had not prepared
punishment, there are not many who would have attained the kingdom.1349 For the promise
of good things doth not so strongly induce the multitude to virtue; as doth the threat of evil
things compel by fear, and arouse them to the care of the soul. So that, although hell be the
opposite of the kingdom of heaven, yet each hath respect to the same end—the salvation of
men; the one alluring to itself, the other driving them towards its opposite, and by the operation
of fear correcting those who are carelessly disposed.</p>
<p>5. I do not enlarge upon this subject without reason; but because there are many who
often, when famines, and droughts, and wars take place, or when the wrath of an Emperor
overtakes them, or when any other unexpected events of this kind happen, deceive the
simpler class by saying, that these things are unworthy of the Providence of God.</p>
<p>I am therefore compelled to dwell on this part of my discourse, that we may not be beguiled
by words, but that we may plainly perceive, that whether He brings upon us a famine,
or a war, or any calamity, whatsoever, He doth it out of His exceeding great care and kindness.
For even those fathers, who especially love their offspring, will forbid them the table, and
inflict stripes, and punish them by disgrace, and in endless other ways of this kind correct
their children when they are disorderly; yet are they nevertheless fathers, not only while
doing them honour, but when acting thus; yea, they are preeminently fathers when they act
thus.1350 But if men, who are frequently carried away beyond what is meet by the force of
angry feelings, are yet held to punish those whom they love, not from cruelty and inhumanity,
but from a kind care and regard; much rather is it proper to be thus minded concerning
God; who in the exceeding abundance of His goodness, far transcends every degree of paternal
fondness. And that you may not suppose that what I say is a mere conjecture, let us,
I pray you, direct our discourse to the Scripture itself. When man, then, had been deceived
and beguiled by the wicked demon, let us observe how God treated him, after his committing

so great a sin. Did He then altogether destroy him? Yet the reason of the thing in justice
demanded this, that one who had displayed nothing that was good, but, after enjoying so
much favour, had waxed wanton even from the very first, should be made away with, and
utterly destroyed; yet God acted not so; neither did He regard with disgust and aversion
him who had been so ungrateful towards his Benefactor, but He comes to him as a physician
cometh to a sick man.</p>
<p>6. Do not, O beloved, pass over unthinkingly, what has just been said! but consider what
an act it was, not to send an angel, or archangel, or any other of his fellow-servants, but that
the Lord Himself should have descended to him who had fallen from the right way, and
should have raised him when thus cast down; and should have approached him, One to
one,1351 as a friend comes to a friend when he is unfortunate, and is plunged in great distress!
For that He acted thus out of His great kindness, the very words too which He spake to him
evidently show His ineffable affection. And why do I say, all the words? The first utterance
signifies at once His tenderness. For He said not, what it was probable a person treated so
contemptuously would say, “O wicked, yea most wicked man! When thou hadst enjoyed
so great favour from Me, and hadst been honoured with such a sovereignty, being exalted
above all the creatures upon the earth for no merit of thine own; and having received in
actual deeds the pledges of My care, and a true manifestation of My Providence, didst thou
esteem a wicked and pestiferous demon, the enemy of thy salvation, to be worthy of more
credit than thy Lord and Benefactor? What proof did he give of regard for thee, like that
which I have done? Did I not make for thee the heaven, the earth, the sea, the sun, the moon,
and all the stars? For truly none of the angels needed this work of creation; but for thee, and
for thy recreation, I made so great and excellent a world; and didst thou esteem mere words
alone, a false engagement, and a promise full of deceit, as more worthy to be believed than
the kindness and providence that was manifested by deeds; that thou gavest thyself over to
him, and didst trample My laws under foot!” These words, and more of this kind, one who
had been treated contemptuously would probably say. But God acted not so; but quite in
the contrary manner. For by His first word He at once raised him up from his dejection,
and gave the fearful and trembling man confidence, by being the first Himself to call him,
or rather, not by merely calling him first, but by addressing him by his own familiar appellation,
and saying, “Adam, where art thou?” Thus He shewed His tenderness, and the great
regard He had for him. For ye must all know, that this is a mark of intimate friendship.1352
And thus those who call upon the dead are wont to do, continually repeating their names.
And so, on the other hand, those who entertain hatred and enmity against any, cannot bear

to mention the very names of those who have aggrieved them. Saul, for instance, though he
had sustained no injury from David, but had wronged him exceedingly, since he abhorred
and hated him, could not endure to mention his proper name; but when all were seated together,
not seeing David to be present, what said he? He said not, “Where is David? but,
‘Where is the son of Jesse?’”1353 calling him by his father’s name. And again, the Jews did
the same with respect to Christ, for since they abhorred and hated Him, they did not say,
“Where is Christ?”1354 but, “Where is that man?”1355</p>
<p>7. But God, willing to show even by this that sin had not quenched His tenderness, nor
disobedience taken away His favor toward him, and that He still exercised His Providence
and care for the fallen one, said, “Adam, where art thou?”1356 not being ignorant of the
place where he was, but because the mouth of those who have sinned is closed up; sin
turning the tongue backward, and conscience taking hold of it; so that such persons remain
speechless, held fast in silence as by a kind of chain. And God wishing therefore to invite
him to freedom of utterance, and to give him confidence, and to lead him to make an apology
for his offences, in order that he might obtain some forgiveness, was Himself the first to
call; cutting off much of Adam’s distress by the familiar appellation, and dispelling his fear,
and opening by this address the mouth that was shut. Hence also it was that he said, “Adam,
where art thou?” “I left thee,” saith he, “in one situation, and I find thee in another. I left
thee in confidence and glory; and I now find thee in disgrace and silence!” And observe the
care of God in this instance. He called not Eve;—He called not the serpent,—but him who
had sinned in the lightest degree of all, he brings first to the tribunal, in order that beginning
from him who was able to find some degree of excuse, He might pass a more merciful sentence,
even against her who had sinned the most. And judges, indeed, do not deign to make
inquiry in their own person of their fellow-servants, and those who are partakers of a common
nature with them, but putting forward some one of their attendants to intervene, they instruct
him to convey their own questions to the criminal; and through him they say and hear
whatever they wish, when they examine the offenders.1357 But God had no need of a gobetween
in dealing with man; but Himself in His own person at once judges and consoles

been His more general and distinctive appellation; though it by no means follows that He was not as familiarly
known by the title of Christ among His followers, and addressed as such, especially after Peter’s confession. (See

him. And not only this is wonderful, but also that he corrects the crimes that had been
committed. For judges in general, when they find thieves and grave-robbers,1358 do not
consider how they may make them better, but how they may make them pay the penalty of
the offences committed. But God, quite on the contrary, when He finds a sinner, considers
not how He may make him pay the penalty, but how He may amend him, and make him
better, and invincible1359 for the future. So that God is at the same time a Judge, a Physician,
and a Teacher; for as a Judge He examines, and as a Physician He amends, and as a Teacher
He instructs those who have sinned, directing them unto all spiritual wisdom.</p>
<p>8. But if one short and simple speech thus demonstrates the care of God, what if we
should read through this whole judgment, and unfold its entire records? Seest thou how all
Scripture is consolation and comfort? But of these records we will speak at a befitting season;
before that, however, it is necessary to state at what time this Book was given; for these
things were not written in the beginning, nor at once when Adam was made,1360 but many
generations afterwards; and it were worth while to enquire for what reason this delay took
place, and why at length they were given to the Jews only, and not to all men; and why
written in the Hebrew tongue; and why in the wilderness of Sinai? For the Apostle doth not
mention the place merely in a cursory manner; but shews that in that circumstance too there
was a great subject of contemplation for us, when he saith to us: “For these are two covenants,
the one from Mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage.”1361</p>
<p>9. Other things too besides these it were to our purpose to enquire into. But I see that
the time doth not permit us to launch our discourse upon so wide a sea; wherefore prudently
reserving these to a fit season, we would again address you on the subject of abstinence from
oaths; and we would entreat your Charity to use much diligence respecting this matter. For
what is it but an absurdity, that not even a servant dares to call his master by name, nor to
mention him unceremoniously, and casually, but that he should everywhere bandy about
the name of the Lord of Angels familiarly with much irreverence! And if it be necessary to
take the book of the Gospel, thou receivest it with hands that have been first washed; and
fearfully and tremblingly, with much reverence and devotion; and dost thou unceremoniously
bandy about upon thy tongue the Lord of the Gospel? Dost thou desire to learn how the
Powers above pronounce that Name; with what awe, with what terror, with what wonder?

Sabaoth; the whole earth is full of His glory!”1362 Perceivest thou, with what dread, with
what awe, they pronounce that Name, whilst glorifying and praising Him? But thou, in thy
prayers and supplications, callest upon Him with much listlessness; when it would become
thee to be full of awe, and to be watchful and sober! But in oaths, where it is wholly unsuitable
that this wonderful Name should be introduced, there thou makest a long string of divers
forms of imprecation! What pardon then, or what excuse shall we have, howsoever we may
plead this “custom”? It is said, that a certain heathen orator, by a kind of foolish habit, was
continually moving his right shoulder as he went along.1363 He conquered this habit, however,
by fastening sharp knives on each side over his shoulders, so that the fear of being cut
controlled the member in its unseasonable movement by fear of the wound! Do thou too,
then, act thus with regard to thy tongue, and instead of the knife, suspend over it the fear
of God’s chastisement, and thou wilt assuredly get the better! For it seems impossible, utterly
impossible, that those should ever be overcome, who are solicitous and earnest about this,
and really make it their business.</p>

to swear even by His glory. “But what shall I do,” saith one, “with those who impose necessity
on me?” What kind of necessity can there be, O man? Let all men understand that thou wilt
choose to suffer anything rather than transgress the law of God; and they will abstain from
compelling thee. For as a proof that it is not an oath which rendereth a man worthy of
credit, but the testimony of his life, the uprightness of his conversation, and his good reputation,

<head>Homily VIII.</head>
<p>An exhortation to virtue—and particularly upon the passage, “God was walking in Paradise
in the cool of the day:”—and again on the subject of abstaining from oaths.</p>
<p>Ye have lately heard, how all Scripture bringeth consolation and comfort, although it
be an historical narrative. For instance, “In the beginning, God created the heaven and the
earth,”1366 was an historical declaration; but it was shewn in our discourse, that this sentence
was one pregnant with comfort; as, for example, that God made us a twofold table,1367 by
spreading out the sea and the land at the same time; by kindling above the twofold lights,
the sun and moon; by determining the twofold seasons of their course, the day and night,
the one for labour, and the other for rest. For the night ministers to us no less benefit than
the day. But as I said with reference to trees, those which are barren, rival in their utility
those which bear fruit; since we are thus not necessitated to touch those trees which are
pleasant for food, for the purposes of building. The wild and untamed animals are also
subservient to our need, in no less a degree than the tame animals; by driving us together,
through the fear of them, into cities; making us more cautious, and binding us to one another;
and by exercising the strength of some, and freeing others from their sicknesses; for the
physicians concoct many medicines out of these;1368 and by reminding us of our ancient
sin. For when I hear it said, “The fear of you, and the dread of you, shall be upon all the wild
beasts of the earth:”1369 and then observe, that this honour was afterwards curtailed, I am
reminded of sin, which hath dissipated the fear of us, and undermined our authority. Thus
I become a better and a wiser1370 man, whilst I learn the harm that sin hath occasioned us.
As then, what I said was, that the things alluded to, and others of a similar kind, which God,
who is the Maker, knoweth of, contribute not a little to our present life; so now also I say,
that the night no less than the day brings along with it its advantage, being a rest from labours,
and a medicine for disease. Often, indeed, physicians, though exerting themselves in many
ways, and preparing an endless variety of remedies, are not able to deliver the man who is
labouring under infirmity. But sleep coming upon him of its own accord hath entirely removed
the disease, and freed them1371 from an infinite deal of trouble. Night, again, is not
only a medicine for bodily labours, but also for mental diseases, in giving rest to anguished

souls. Ofttimes it happeneth that some one hath lost a son;1372 and comforters without
number have been of no avail to withdraw him from tears and groans. But on the approach
of night, conquered by the despotic power1373 of sleep, he hath closed his eyelids in slumber,
and received some small relief from the miseries of the day time.</p>
<p>2. And now, I pray you, let us proceed to the subject which hath given rise to these observations.
For well I know, that ye are all eagerly awaiting this matter; and that each one
of you is in pain till he learn on what account this Book was not given from the beginning.
But even now I do not see that the time is fit for a discourse on this subject. And why so?
Because the week hath nearly arrived at its close with us, and I fear to touch upon a subject,
the exposition of which I should presently afterwards be obliged to cut short. For the subject
requires of us several days in succession, and a continuous effort of memory: wherefore we
must again defer it.1374 But take it not amiss! we will assuredly pay you the debt with interest;
for thus it is expedient both for you, and for us who are to discharge it. Meanwhile, however,
let us now speak on that subject which we left out yesterday. And what was it we left out
yesterday? “God was walking,” it says, “in Paradise in the cool of the day.”1375 What is here
meant, I ask? “God was walking!” God was not walking; for how should He do this who is
everywhere present and filleth all things? But He caused a perception of this sort in Adam,
in order that he might collect1376 himself; that he might not be careless; that in flying and
in hiding himself, he might present beforehand some portion of the excuse, even before any
words had passed. For even as those who are about to be led to the tribunal, to sustain the
charges respecting the crimes they have committed, present themselves before those who
are to try them with a squalid, begrimed, sad, and subdued visage, in order that from their
appearance, they may incline them to loving-kindness, mercy, and forgiveness, so also did
it happen in the case of Adam. For it was necessary that he should be led to this Tribunal
in a subdued state. Therefore God took him beforehand, and humbled him. But that some
one was walking there, he perceived; but whence came he to suppose that God was walking
there? Such is the habitual custom of those who have committed sin. They are suspicious
of all things; they tremble at shadows; they are in terror at every sound, and they imagine
that every one is approaching them in a hostile manner. Often therefore the guilty, when

they observe people running on another business, suppose that they are come against them;
and when others are conversing one with another on quite a different subject, they that are
conscious of sin suppose they are conversing about them.</p>
<p>3. For such is the nature of sin, that it betrays whilst no one finds fault; it condemns
whilst no one accuses; it makes the sinner a timid being; one that trembles at a sound; even
as righteousness has the contrary effect. Hear, at least, how the Scripture describes this
cowardice of the former, and this boldness of the latter. “The wicked flee when no man
pursueth.”1377 How doth he flee when no man pursueth? He hath that within which drives
him on—an accuser in his conscience; and this he carries about everywhere; and just as it
would be impossible to flee from himself, so neither can he escape the persecutor within;
but wherever he goeth,1378 he is scourged, and hath an incurable wound! But not such is
the righteous man. Of what nature then is he? Hear: “The righteous is bold as a lion!” Such
a man was Elias. He saw, for instance, the king coming towards him, and when he said,
“Why is it that thou pervertest Israel?”1379 he answered, “I pervert not Israel, but thou and
thy father’s house.”1380 Truly, the just man is bold as a lion; for he stood up against the king
just as a lion doth against some vile cur. Although the one had the purple, the other had the
sheepskin, which was the more venerable garment of the two; for that purple brought forth
the grievous famine; but this sheepskin effected a liberation from that calamity! It divided
the Jordan! It made Elisha a two-fold1381 Elias! O how great is the virtue of the Saints! Not
only their words; not only their bodies, but even their very garments are always esteemed
venerable by the whole creation. The sheepskin of this man divided the Jordan! the sandals
of the Three Children trampled down the fire! The word of Elisha changed the waters, so
that it made them to bear the iron on their surface! The rod of Moses divided the Red Sea
and cleft1382 the rock! The garments of Paul expelled diseases! The shadow of Peter put
death to flight! The ashes of the holy Martyrs1383 drive away demons! For this reason they
do all things with authority, even as Elias did. For he looked not on the diadem, nor the

outward pomp1384 of the king, but he looked on the soul clad in rags, squalid, begrimed,
and in a more wretched condition than that of any criminal; and seeing him the captive and
slave of his passions, he despised his power. For he seemed to see a king but in a scene, and
not a real one. For what was the advantage of outward abundance, when the poverty within
was so great? And what harm could outward poverty do, when there was such a treasure of
wealth within? Such a lion also was the blessed Paul; for when he had entered into the prison,
and only raised his voice, he shook all the foundations; he gnawed in pieces1385 the fetters,
employing not his teeth, but words; on which account it were fitting to call such men not
merely lions, but something more than lions; for a lion ofttimes, after he hath fallen into a
net, is taken; but the Saints when they are bound, become still more powerful; just as this
blessed man did then in the prison, having loosed the prisoners, shaken the walls, and bound
the keeper, and overcome him by the word of godliness. The lion uttereth his voice, and
putteth all the wild beasts to flight. The Saint uttereth his voice, and driveth away the demons
on every side! The weapons of the lion are a hairy mane, pointed claws, and sharp teeth.
The weapons of the righteous man are spiritual wisdom, temperance, patience, contempt
of all present things. Whoever hath these weapons shall not only be able to deride wicked
men, but even the adverse powers themselves.</p>
<p>4. Study then, O man, the life according to God, and no one shall conquer thee at any
time; and although thou mayest be accounted the most insignificant of men, thou shalt be
more powerful than all. On the other hand, if thou art indifferent about virtue of soul, though
thou wert the most powerful of men, thou wilt easily be worsted by all that assail thee. And
the examples already quoted proved this. But if thou art desirous, I will also endeavour to
teach thee by actual facts1386 the unconquerableness of the righteous, and the vulnerable
condition of sinners. Hear then how the prophet intimates both these particulars. “The
ungodly,” saith he, “are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind scattereth away from
the face of the earth.”1387 For even as chaff lies exposed to the gusts of wind, and is easily
caught up and swept along, so is also the sinner driven about by every temptation; for whilst
he is at war with himself, and bears the warfare about with him, what hope of safety does
he possess; betrayed as he is at home, and carrying with him that conscience, which is a
constant enemy? Such, however, is not the nature of the righteous man. But what manner
of man is he? Hear the same prophet, saying, “They that trust in the Lord are as Mount
Zion.”1388 What means then, “As Mount Zion?” “He shall not be shaken,” saith he, “for

ever.” For whatever engines thou bringest up, whatever darts thou hurlest, desiring to
overturn a mountain, thou wilt never be able to prevail; for how canst thou? thou wilt break
in pieces all thine engines, and exhaust thine own strength. Such also is the righteous man.
Whatever blows he may receive, he suffereth no evil therefrom; but destroyeth the power
of those who take counsel against him, and not of men only, but of demons. Thou hast heard
often what engines the Devil brought up against Job; but not only did he fail to overthrow
that mountain, but drew back exhausted, his darts broken to pieces, and his engines rendered
useless, by that assault!</p>
<p>5. Knowing these things, let us take heed to our life; and let us not be earnest as to the
goods that perish; neither as to the glory that goeth out; nor as to that body which groweth
old; nor as to that beauty which is fading; nor as to that pleasure which is fleeting; but let
us expend all our care about the soul; and let us provide for the welfare of this in every way.
For to cure the body, when diseased, is not an easy matter to every one; but to cure a sick
soul is easy to all; and the sickness of the body requires medicines, as well as money, for its
healing; but the healing of the soul is a thing that is easy to procure, and devoid of expense.
And the nature of the flesh is with much labour delivered from those wounds which are
troublesome; for very often the knife must be applied, and medicines that are bitter; but
with respect to the soul there is nothing of this kind. It suffices only to exercise the will, and
the desire, and all things are accomplished. And this hath been the work of God’s providence.
For inasmuch as from bodily sickness no great injury could arise, (for though we were not
diseased, yet death would in any case come, and destroy and dissolve the body); but
everything depends upon the health of our souls; this being by far the more precious and
necessary, He hath made the medicining of it easy, and void of expense or pain. What excuse
therefore, or what pardon shall we obtain, if when the body is sick, and money must be expended
on its behalf, and physicians called in, and much anguish endured, we make this so
much a matter of our care (though what might result from that sickness could be no great
injury to us), and yet treat the soul with neglect? And this, when we are neither called upon
to pay down money; nor to give others any trouble; nor to sustain any sufferings; but without
any of all these things, by only choosing and willing, have it in our power to accomplish the
entire amendment of it; and knowing assuredly that if we fail to do this, we shall sustain the
extreme sentence, and punishments, and penalties, which are inexorable! For tell me, if any
one promised to teach thee the healing art in a short space of time, without money or labour,
wouldest thou not think him a benefactor? Wouldest thou not submit both to do and to
suffer all things, whatsoever he who promised these things commanded? Behold, now, it is
permitted thee without labour to find a medicine for wounds, not of the body, but of the
soul, and to restore it to a state of health, without any suffering! Let us not be indifferent to
the matter! For pray what is the pain of laying aside anger against one who hath aggrieved
thee? It is a pain, indeed, to remember injuries, and not to be reconciled! What labour is it

<pb n="572"/>
to pray, and to ask for a thousand good things from God, who is ready to give? What labour
is it, not to speak evil of any one? What difficulty is there in being delivered from envy and
ill-will? What trouble is it to love one’s neighbour? What suffering is it not to utter shameful
words, nor to revile, nor to insult another? What fatigue is it not to swear? for again I return
to this same admonition. The labour of swearing is indeed exceedingly great. Oftentimes,
whilst under the influence of anger or wrath, we have sworn, perhaps, that we would never
be reconciled to those who have injured us. Yet afterwards, when our wrath was quenched,
and our anger allayed, desiring to be reconciled, and restrained by the obligation of these
oaths, we have suffered the same anguish, as if we were in a snare, and held fast by indissoluble
bonds. Of which fact the Devil being aware, and understanding clearly that anger is a
fire; that it is easily extinguished, and that when it is extinguished, then reconciliation and
love follows; wishing this fire to remain unquenched, he often binds us by an oath; so that
although the anger should cease, the obligation of the oath remaining may keep up the fire
within us; and that one of these two things may take place, either that being reconciled we
are forsworn, or that not being reconciled we subject ourselves to the penalties of cherishing
malice.</p>
<p>6. Knowing these things then, let us avoid oaths; and let our mouth continually practise
the saying, “Believe me;”1389 and this will be to us a foundation for all pious behaviour;1390
for the tongue, when it has been disciplined to use this one expression, is ashamed, and
would blush to utter words that are disgraceful and ugly; and should it at any time be drawn
away by habit, it will be checked again, by having many accusers. For when any one observes
him who is not a swearer giving utterance to foul words, he will take his advantage over
him, and ridicule, and exclaim tauntingly, “Thou who sayest in all affairs, ‘Believe me,’ and
venturest not to utter an oath, dost thou disgrace thy tongue with these shameful expressions?”
So that being forcibly urged by those who are with us, even if unwilling, we shall
return again to a pious behaviour. “But what,” says one, “if it be necessary to take an oath?”
Where there is a transgression of the law, there is no such thing as necessity. “Is it possible
then,” it is replied, “not to swear at all?” What sayest thou? Hath God commanded, and
darest thou to ask if it be possible for His law to be kept? Why, truly it is a thing impossible
that His law should not be kept; and I am desirous to persuade you from present circumstances
of this; that so far from its being impossible not to swear, it is impossible to swear.1391
For behold, the inhabitants of the city were commanded to bring in a payment of gold,1392
such as it might have seemed beyond the power of many to do; yet the greater part of the

sum has been collected; and you may hear the tax gatherers saying, “Why delay, man? Why
put us off from day to day? It is not possible to avoid it. It is the law of the Emperor, which
admits of no delay.” What sayest thou, I ask? The Emperor hath commanded thee to bring

oaths! and how sayest thou, it is impossible to avoid them!</p>
<p>7. I am now for the sixth day admonishing you in respect of this precept. Henceforth,
I am desirous to take leave1393 of you, meaning to abstain from the subject, that ye may be
on your guard. There will no longer be any excuse or allowance for you; for of right, indeed,
if nothing had been said on this matter, it ought to have been amended of yourselves, for it
is not a thing of an intricate nature, or that requires great preparation. But since ye have
enjoyed the advantage of so much admonition and counsel, what excuse will ye have to offer,
when ye stand accused before that dread tribunal, and are required to give account of this
transgression. It is impossible to invent any excuse; but of necessity you must either go
hence amended, or, if you have not amended, be punished, and abide the extremest penalty!
Thinking, therefore, upon all these things, and departing hence with much anxiety about
them, exhort ye one another, that the things spoken of during so many days may be kept
with all watchfulness in your minds, so that whilst we are silent, ye instructing, edifying,
exhorting one another, may exhibit great improvement; and having fulfilled all the other
precepts, may enjoy eternal crowns; which God grant we may all obtain, through the grace
and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and with whom be glory, to the
Father, together with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Commendation of those who had laid aside the practice of swearing. It is shown that no one
need scruple about hearing the divine oracles in the Church after a meal. Answer to the
question, Why it was so long before the Holy Scriptures were given? Comment on the
passage, “The heavens declare the glory of God,” with a description of the natural world.
And finally, an admonition against swearing.</p>
<p>1. It was but lately that I spoke to you as I do now to you again! And O that I could be
always with you,—yea, rather am I always with you, though not by bodily presence, yet by
the power of love! For I have no other life but1394 you, and the care of your salvation. As
the husbandman hath no other anxiety, but about his seeds and his harvests; and the pilot
about the waves and the harbours; so the preacher is anxious with respect to his auditors
and their progress, even as I am at the present time! Wherefore I bear you all upon my mind,
not only here, but also at home. For if the multitude be great, and the measure of my heart
be narrow, yet love is wide; and “ye are not straitened in us.” I will not add what follows
next,1395 for neither are we straitened with you. Whence is this apparent? Because I have
met with many who have said, “We have performed the precept, by making rules for each
other, defining penalties for those who swear, and enforcing punishment upon those who
transgress this law.” A punishment which is indeed well becoming you,1396 and which is a
sign of the greatest charity. For I am not ashamed of making myself busy in these matters,
since this love of interference does not proceed from idle curiosity but from tender care.1397
For if it be no reproach to the physician to make enquiry concerning the patient, neither is
it any fault in us to be ever asking about your salvation; since thus being informed what has
been accomplished, and what has been left undone, we shall be able to apply the further
remedies with the requisite knowledge.1398 These things we have ascertained by enquiry;
and we give thanks to God that we have not sown our seed upon rocks, nor dropped it
amidst thorns; and that we have neither needed much time, nor long delay, in order that
we might reap the harvest. On this account I have you continually upon my heart. On this
account I do not feel the labours of teaching, being eased of the burden by the profit of the

hearer. This reward is, indeed, sufficient to recruit our strength, to give us wings, to elevate
us, and to persuade us to undergo the utmost toil on your behalf.</p>
<p>2. Since therefore ye have manifested much generosity of feeling, suffer us to discharge
the further debt of which we gave a promise the other day; although indeed I see not all
present1399 who were here when I made the promise. What, I would ask, can be the cause
of this? What hath repelled them from our table? He that hath partaken of a bodily meal, it
would seem, has thought it an indignity after receiving material food, to come to the hearing
of the divine oracles. But not rightly do they think thus. For if this were improper, Christ
would not have gone through His large and long discourses after that mystic supper; and if
this had been unsuitable, He would not, when He had fed the multitude in the desert, have
communicated His discourses to them after that meal. For (if one must say something
startling on this point), the hearing of the divine oracles at that time is especially profitable.
For when thou hast made up thy mind that after eating and drinking thou must repair also
to the assembly, thou wilt assuredly be careful, though perchance with reluctance, of the
duty of sobriety; and wilt neither be led away at any time into excess of wine, or gluttony.
For the thought, and the expectation of entering the church, schools thee to partake of food
and drink with becoming decency; lest, after thou hast entered there, and joined thy brethren,
thou shouldest appear ridiculous to all present, by smelling of wine, and unmannerly
eructation.1400 These things I now speak not to you who are now present, but to the absent;
that they may learn them through your means. For it is not having eaten that hinders one’s
hearing, but listlessness. But thou whilst deeming it to be a condemnation not to fast, then
addest another fault, which is far greater and heavier, in not being a partaker of this sacred
food;1401 and having nourished the body, thou consumest the soul with famine. Yet what
kind of apology hast thou for doing this? For in the matter of fasting thou hast, perhaps,
bodily weakness to plead, but what hast thou to say with respect to hearing? For surely
weakness of body is no impediment to thy partaking of the divine oracles! If I had said, “Let
no one who has breakfasted1402 mix with us;” “let no one who has eaten be a hearer,” thou
<note type="footnote">1399 This Homily is placed by Montfaucon on the Monday after the last; it is difficult to find any especial
reason for the circumstance here referred to; there was the same impediment when the following Homily was
delivered. Perhaps the most probable account is, that some persons began the fast with a strictness from which
they afterwards fell off. The meal spoken of was an early dinner. Eumæus takes his ˆριστον at daybreak, Od. xvi.
2. But Athenæus, l. i. c. 9 and 10, says that in his day such a meal was called ‡κρ€τισμα, and the δεῖπνον of the

<pb n="576"/>
wouldest have had some kind of excuse; but now, when we would fain drag, entice, and
beseech you to come, what apology can ye have for turning away from us? The unfit hearer
is not he that hath eaten and drunk; but he who gives no heed to what is said, who yawns,
and is slack in attention, having his body here, but his mind wandering elsewhere, and such
a one, though he may be fasting, is an unprofitable hearer. On the other hand, the man who
is in earnest, who is watchful and keeps his mind in a state of attention, though he may have
eaten and drunk, will be our most suitable hearer of all. For this rule, indeed, very properly
prevails with relation to the secular tribunals and councils. Inasmuch as they know not how
to be spiritually wise, therefore they eat not to nourishment, but to bursting; and they drink
often to excess. For this reason, as they render themselves unfit for the management of their
affairs, they shut up the court-houses and council-chambers in the evening and at midday.1403
But here there is nothing of this sort,—God forbid! But he who has eaten will rival him who
fasts, as far as regards sobriety of soul; for he eats and drinks, not so as to distend the stomach,
or to darken the reason, but in such a way as to recruit the strength of the body when it has
become weakened.</p>
<p>3. But enough of this admonition. It is time now to deal with our subject; although our
mind holds back and shrinks from giving this instruction, on account of those who are not
come. And just as an affectionate mother when she is about to spread out her table, grieves
and laments when all her children are not there, thus also do I now suffer; and when I think
of the absence of our brethren, I am reluctant to discharge my debt. But ye have it in your
power to rid me of this tardiness. For if ye promise me that ye will convey to them an exact
report of all I say, we shall readily pay you down the whole;1404 for thus the instructions,
charitably afforded on your part, will make up to them for their absence; and ye will hear
me the more attentively, knowing that you must necessarily give an account of these things
to others. In order then that our subject may be made the clearer, let us take it up and repeat
it from the beginning. We were enquiring, then, the other day, “On what account the
Scriptures were delivered after so many years. For this Book was delivered neither in the
time of Adam, nor of Noah, nor of Abraham, but in that of Moses. And I hear many who
<note type="footnote">1403 A canon of Isaac Lingonensis (in the eighth century), Tit. viii. cap. 2, Labbe viii. 620, forbids any one to
take an oath except fasting. The Athenian courts did not sit after sunset, and the great time for forensic business
was the forenoon. Goeller on Thuc. viii. 92. Ælian, V. H. xii. 30, says that the luxurious Tarentines would be
drunk even when the forum is fullest, περὶ πλήθουσαν ‡γορ€ν. v. Act. ii. 15; Perizonius on Ælian, cites Dio
Chrys. Or. 67, de Glor. 2, who shews it was about that time.</note>
<note type="footnote">1404 i.e, the promise of explaining that subject which had been proposed in the two foregoing Homilies;
namely, the reason why the gift of Holy Scripture was so long delayed.</note>

<pb n="577"/>
say, that if the Book was profitable, it ought to have been delivered from the very beginning;
but if it was useless, it ought not to have been delivered afterwards. But this is an obsolete
argument; for it is not quite true that anything which is profitable ought to have been delivered
from the beginning, nor if anything was delivered from the beginning, is it quite
necessary that the same should continue afterwards.1405 For example; Milk is useful, yet it
is not always given; but it is given to us only when we are children; and solid food is useful;
but no one ever gives it us in the beginning of our life, but when we have passed out of the
age of childhood. Again, the summer season is useful; but it does not show itself constantly;
and the winter season is advantageous; yet this too makes room for others. What then? Do
they say that the Scriptures are not useful? I reply; they are most useful and most necessary.
And if so useful, for what reason then, say they, were they not delivered to us from the beginning?
It was because God was desirous of instructing the nature of man, not by letters,
but by things.1406 But what does the expression “by things” signify? By means of the Creation
itself.</p>
<p>4. Observe then, how the Apostle, alighting upon this same topic, and directing himself
to those very Greeks who said, that they had not from the beginning learnt the knowledge
of God from the Scriptures, frames his answer. Having said that, “the wrath of God is revealed
from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in
unrighteousness;”1407 when he saw that he was met by an objection; and that many would
still enquire, from whence the Gentiles knew the truth of God, he goes on to add, “Because
that which may be known of God is manifest in them.” But how is it manifest in them? How
were they able to know God, and who hath shewed? Declare this. “God,” saith he, “hath
shewed it unto them.” In what manner? By the sending of what kind of prophet? what
evangelist? what kind of teacher? if the holy Scriptures were not yet given. “The invisible
things of Him,” says he, “from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood
by the things that are made, even His eternal Power and Godhead.”1408 But what he means
is just this, He hath placed His Creation in the midst, before the eyes of all men; in order
that they may guess at the Creator from His works; which, indeed, another writer has referred
to; “For from the greatness and beauty of the creatures, proportionably the Maker of them
is seen.”1409 Seest thou the greatness? Marvel at the power of Him that made it! Seest thou
<note type="footnote">1405 See Butler’s Analogy, p. ii. c. 6, where the somewhat similar objection, “that Christianity is not universal,”
is discussed.</note>
<note type="footnote">1406 An enlarged view of this principle is given in Butler’s Analogy, p. ii. c. 7, applying it further to the facts
recorded in Holy Scripture. “The general design of Scripture, which contains in it this revelation, thus considered
as historical, may be said to be, to give us an account of the world, in this one single view, as God’s world.”</note>

<pb n="578"/>
the beauty? be astonished at the wisdom which adorned it! This it was which the prophet
signified when he said, “The heavens declare the glory of God.”1410 How then, tell me, do
they declare it? Voice they have none; mouth they possess not; no tongue is theirs! how then
do they declare? By means of the spectacle itself. For when thou seest the beauty, the breadth,
the height, the position, the form, the stability thereof during so long a period; hearing as
it were a voice, and being instructed by the spectacle, thou adorest Him who created a body
so fair and strange! The heavens may be silent, but the sight of them emits a voice, that is
louder than a trumpet’s sound; instructing us not by the ear, but through the medium of
the eyes; for the latter is a sense which is more sure and more distinct than the former.</p>
<p>5. For if God had given instruction by means of books, and of letters, he who knew letters
would have learnt what was written; but the illiterate man would have gone away without
receiving any benefit from this source, unless some one else had introduced him to it; and
the wealthy man would have purchased the Bible, but the poor man would not have been
able to obtain it. Again, he who knew the language that was expressed by the letters, might
have known what was therein contained; but the Scythian, and the Barbarian, and the Indian,
and the Egyptian, and all those who were excluded from that language, would have gone
away without receiving any instruction. This however cannot be said with respect to the
heavens; but the Scythian, and Barbarian, and Indian, and Egyptian, and every man that
walks upon the earth, shall hear this voice; for not by means of the ears, but through the
sight, it reaches our understanding. And of the things that are seen, there is one uniform
perception; and there is no difference, as is the case with respect to languages. Upon this
volume the unlearned, as well as the wise man, shall be alike able to look; the poor man as
well as the rich man; and wherever any one may chance to come, there looking upwards
towards the heavens, he will receive a sufficient lesson from the view of them: and the
prophet himself intimated and indicated this fact, that the creation utters this voice so as to
be intelligible to barbarians, and to Greeks, and to all mankind without exception, when he
spoke on this wise; “There is no speech, nor language, where there voice is not heard.”1411
What he means is to this effect, that there is no nation or tongue which is unable to understand
this language; but that such is their utterance, that it may be heard of all mankind.
And that not merely of the heavens, but of the day and night. But how of the day and night?
The heavens, indeed, by their beauty and magnitude, and by all the rest, astonish the beholder,
and transport him to an admiration of the Creator; but as to the day and night, what can
these show us of the same kind? Nothing certainly of the same kind, but other things which
are not inferior to them; as for example; the harmony, and the order which they so accurately
observe. For when thou considerest how they distribute between them the whole year, and
<note type="footnote">1410 Ps. xix. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">1411 Ps. xix. 3.</note>

<pb n="579"/>
mutually divide the length of the whole space, even as if it were by a beam and scales, thou
wilt be astonished at Him who hath ordered them! For just as certain sisters dividing their
father’s inheritance among themselves with much affection, and not insulting one another
in the smallest degree, even so too the day and the night distribute the year with such an
equality of parts, with the utmost accuracy;1412 and keep to their own boundaries, and
never push one another aside. Never hath the day been long in winter; and in like manner
never hath the night been long in summer, whilst so many generations have passed away;
but during so great an interval and length of time one hath not defrauded the other even in
the smallest degree; not of half an hour’s space, no, nor of the twinkling of an eye!</p>
<p>6. Therefore also the Psalmist,1413 struck with astonishment at the equality of this distribution,
exclaimed, “Night unto night sheweth knowledge.” If thou knowest how to meditate
wisely on these matters, thou wilt admire the Being who fixed these immoveable
boundaries even from the beginning. Let the avaricious hear these things; and those who
are coveting the wealth of others; and let them imitate the equality of the day and night. Let
those who are puffed up and high-minded also hear; and those who are unwilling to concede
the first places to others! The day gives place to the night, and does not invade the territory
of others! But thou, whilst always enjoying honour, canst thou not bear to share it with thy
brethren? Consider also with me the wisdom of the Lawgiver. In winter He hath ordered
that the night should be long; when the germs1414 are tender, and require more coolness;
and are unable to sustain the hotter rays of the sun; but when they are somewhat grown,
the day again increases with them, and becomes then the longest, when the fruit has now
attained ripeness. And this is a beneficial arrangement not only for seeds, but for our bodies.
For since during winter, the sailor, and the pilot, and the traveller, and the soldier, and the
farmer, sit down for the most part at home, fettered by the frost; and the season is one of
idleness; God hath appointed that the greater part of this time should be consumed in night,
in order that the length of the day might not be superfluous, when men were unable to do
anything. Who can describe the perfect order of the seasons; and how these, like some virgins
dancing in a circle, succeed one another with the happiest harmony; and how those who
are in the middle cease not to pass over to the opposite ones with a gradual and noiseless
transition? Therefore, neither are we overtaken by the summer immediately after winter;
nor by the winter immediately after the summer; but mid-way the spring is interposed; that
<note type="footnote">1412 The diurnal motion of the earth, or, as they called it, of the heavens, was taken by Plato for the very type
of stability. The exactness of its rate is far greater than the ancients had means to appreciate, as is proved by
constant observations, as well as by the oldest eclipses.</note>

while we gently and gradually take up one season after the other, we may have our bodies
hardened to encounter the summer heat without uneasiness. For since sudden changes to
opposite extremes are productive of the worst injury and disease, God hath contrived that
after winter we should take up the spring, and after the spring the summer; and after the
summer the autumn; and thus transport us to winter, so that these changes from seasons
which are opposite, should come upon us harmlessly and by degrees, through the aid of
intermediate ones. Who then is so wretched and pitiable, that beholding the heavens; and
beholding sea, and land; and beholding this exact adjustment of the seasons, and the unfailing
order of day and night, he can think that these things happen of their own accord, instead
of adoring Him who hath arranged them all with a corresponding wisdom!</p>
<p>7. But I have yet somewhat more to say on this head. For not only, indeed, does the
magnitude and beauty of the creation, but also the very manner of it, display a God who is
the artificer of the universe. For since we were not present at the beginning, whilst he was
engaged in the work of forming and creating all things; nor had we been present, could we
have known how they came into being,1415 the power that disposed them being invisible;
He hath made the mode of this creation to become our best teacher, by compounding all
things in a manner which transcends the course of nature. Perhaps what I have said, is not
sufficiently clear. Therefore it is necessary that I should again repeat it in a clearer manner.
All men, then, must admit that it is the course of nature for water to be supported on the
earth, and not the earth on the waters. For the earth being a certain dense, hard, unyielding,
and solid substance, is easily able to support the nature of water; but the water, which is
fluid, and rare, and soft, and diffusive, and giving way to all it meets with, must be unable
to support any solid body, though it were of the lightest kind. Often indeed when a small
pebble fails upon it, it yields, and makes way, and sends it down to the bottom. When
therefore thou beholdest not a small pebble, but the whole earth borne upon the waters,
and not submerged, admire the power of Him who wrought these marvellous things in a
supernatural manner! And whence does this appear, that the earth is borne upon the waters?
The prophet declares this when he says, “He hath founded it upon the seas, and prepared
it upon the floods.”1416 And again: “To him who hath founded the earth upon the waters.”1417
<note type="footnote">1415 See Job xxxviii. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">1416 Ps. xxiv. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">1417 Ps. cxxxvi. 6. Among the variety of opinions that anciently prevailed respecting the earth’s form and
situation, one of the principal was, that the heavens and earth above this ocean was the only visible universe;
and that all beneath the ocean was Hades, or the invisible world. Hence when the sun set, he was said, tingere
se oceano; and when any went to Hades, they must first pass the ocean. Of this opinion were not only the ancient
poets, but some of the Christian Fathers, particularly Lactantius, and St. Augustin, and others, who thought
their opinion was favoured by the Psalmist, in Ps. xxiv. 2, and cxxxvi. 6. Derham’s Physico-Theology, p. 41. St.
Chrysostom must evidently have adopted the same opinion. St. Greg. Nyss. in Hexæm. t. l., p. 22e., speaks of</note>

What sayest thou? The water is not able to support a small pebble on its surface, and yet
bears up the earth, great as it is; and mountains, and hills, and cities, and plants, and men,
and brutes; and it is not submerged! What do I say? Is not submerged? How comes it to
pass, that since the water has been in close contact with it below, during so long a period,
it has not been dissolved, and the whole of it become mud? For the substance of wood, when
soaked in water but a little time, is rotted and dissolved; and why do I say of wood? What
can be firmer than iron? yet often this is softened, when it remains a long time in water; and
well it may. For it derives its substance from the earth. Therefore many run-away servants,
when they make their escape, dragging their shackles and chains along with them, go to
brooks of water, and thrust their shackled feet therein, and after making the iron softer by
this means, they easily break it by striking it with a stone. Iron, forsooth, is softened, and
wood is rotted, and stones are worn away by the nature of water; yet so great a mass as the
earth hath remained such a length of time lying upon the waters, without being either submerged,
or dissolved, and destroyed!1418</p>
<p>8. And who is there that must not feel astonished and amazed at these things; and confidently
pronounce that they are not the works of nature, but of that Providence which is
above nature? Therefore one speaks thus: “Who hangeth the earth upon nothing.”1419 And
another observes, “In His hands are the corners of the earth.”1420 And again: “He hath laid
the foundation of it upon the seas.”1421 And these declarations, though they seem contrary
to one another, have yet an entire agreement. For he that said, “He hath laid the foundation
of it upon the seas,” meant the same thing as he did who declared, “He hath hung it upon
nothing.” For its standing upon the waters is just the same thing as hanging upon nothing.
Where then is it suspended and placed? Hear the same one saying, “In His hands are the
corners of the earth.” Not that God hath hands, but that thou mayest know that His power
it is, providing for all things which holds together1422 and supports the body of the earth!
But if thou believest not what I now say, believe what thou beholdest! for even in another

180,000 stadia round. See St. Greg. Naz. Or. xxviii. al. xxxiv. c. 28, and Philoponus de Mund. Cr. iii. 6–13; Galland,

element it is possible to find this admirable workmanship. For it is the nature of fire to tend
upwards,1423 and to be always mounting aloft; and although you force and constrain it
never so much, it cannot submit to have its course directed downwards. For often, when
we are carrying a lighted torch, although we incline its head downwards, we cannot compel
the force of the flame to direct itself to the ground; but still it turns upward, and passes from
below toward that which is above. But with respect to the sun, God hath made it quite the
contrary. For He hath turned his beams toward the earth, and made his light to direct itself
downward, all but saying to him by the very shape (of the heavens), “Look downward.—Shine
upon men, for thou wert made for them!” The light, indeed, of a candle cannot be made to
submit to this; but this star, great and marvellous as it is, bends downward, and looks toward
the earth, which is contrary to the nature of fire; owing to the power of Him who hath
commanded it. Wouldest thou have me speak of another thing of the like kind? Waters
embrace the back of the visible heaven1424 on all parts; and yet they neither flow down, nor
are moved out of their place, although the nature of water is not of this kind. For it easily
runs together into what is concave; but when the body is of a convex form, it glides away
on all sides; and not even a small portion1425 is capable of standing upon such a figure.1426
But, lo! this wonder is found to exist in the heavens; and the prophet, again, to intimate this
very circumstance, observes, “Praise the Lord, ye waters that are above the heavens.”1427
Besides, the water hath not quenched the sun; nor hath the sun, which hath gone on his way
beneath for so long a time, dried up the water that lies above.</p>
<p>9. Dost thou desire that we should lead thee down again to the earth, and point out the
marvel? Seest thou not this sea abounding with waves, and fierce winds; yet this sea, spacious,
and large, and furious as it is, is walled in with a feeble sand! Mark also the wisdom of God,

<note type="footnote">1424 In accordance with the notions of his age, St. Chrysostom supposed that the firmament was something
solid; and it seems to have been entirely a notion of modern times, that the visible heavens are formed of a subtle
ether. Thus Homer terms them χ€λκεον οὐρανὸν, and χαλκοβατῆ δώματα; and sometimes σιδήρειον οὐρανόν.
The notion of St. Chrysostom seems to have been similar. He supposes a solid spherical arch, which he terms
the visible heaven, which divided the waters above from those below it. See Gen. i. 7. A similar idea seems to
have prevailed among those who translated the Bible into English, from the use of the word firmament, which
was however a mere copying of the Vulgate, and the Greek στερεωμα. It is remarkable that this idea is defended
by Drusius in his Loca Difficiliora Pentateuchi, and in Sylvester’s translation of Du Bartas’s Weeks and Days.</note>

be of mere natural regulation; but remaining within its limits, it lifts up its voice, and is in
tumult, and roars aloud, and raises its waves to a prodigious height. But when it comes to
the shores, and beholds the sand, it breaks up, and returns back again within itself; teaching
thee, by both these things, that it is not the work of nature that it remains within its
boundaries, but the work of Him whose power restrains it! For this cause accordingly He
hath made the wall feeble; and hath not encompassed these shores with wood, or stone, or
mountains, lest thou shouldest impute the regulation of the elements to such things. And,
therefore, God Himself, upbraiding the Jews with this very circumstance, said, “Fear ye not
Me, which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea that it cannot pass it.”1428 But the
marvellous thing is not this only, that He hath made a great and admirable world; and that
He hath compacted it in a way above the usual course of nature; but that He hath also constituted
it out of opposite things; such as hot and cold, dry and moist, fire and water, earth
and air, and that these contrary elements, of which this whole universe consists, though
continually at strife one with another, are not consumed of one another. The fire hath not
overrun and burnt up all things; the water hath not overflowed and drowned the whole
earth. With respect to our bodies, however, these effects really take place; and upon the increase
of the bile, fever is generated; and the whole animal frame sustains an injury; and
when there is a superabundance of phlegm, many diseases are produced which destroy the
animal. But in the case of the universe, nothing of this kind happens; but each thing remains
held as it were by a kind of bridle and band; preserving, by the will of the Creator, its own
boundaries; and their strife becomes a source of peace to the whole. Are not these things
evident even to a blind man? and are not even the simple easily able to comprehend, that
they were made, and are upheld, by some Providence? For who is so silly and senseless, that
beholding such a mass of substances, such beauty, such combination, the continual strife
of such vast elements, their opposition, and yet durability, would not reason with himself
and say, “If there were not some Providence to uphold the mass of these bodies, not permitting
the universe to fall to pieces, it could not remain; it could not have been lasting. So
perfect is the order of the seasons, such the harmony of the day and night, so many the kinds
of brute animals, and plants, and seeds, and herbs, that preserve their course, and yet, to
the present day, none has ever fallen into decay or sudden dissolution.</p>
<p>10. We might continue to speak not only of these things, but also of many others, which
are even more profound; and might moralise even upon the Creation itself; but reserving
these subjects for the morrow,1429 let us earnestly endeavour to retain what has been said,
and to convey it to the rest.1430 I know indeed, that the abstruseness of these speculations

has seemed strange to your ears; but if we be a little vigilant, and accustom ourselves to
them, we shall easily be able to teach others. Meanwhile, it is necessary farther to say this
to your Charity. Even as God hath given us glory by means of this great creation, so let us
also glorify Him by a pure conversation! “The heavens declare the glory of God,” though
only seen; and we therefore should declare God’s glory1431 not only in speaking, but in silence,
and in astonishing all men by the brightness of our life. For He saith, “Let your light
so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is
in heaven.”1432 For when an unbeliever beholds thee, who art a believer, subdued, modest,
and orderly in manners, he will wonder and say, “Truly great is the God of the Christians!
What manner of men hath He formed? What, and from what hath He made them? Hath
He turned them from men into angels? If any one treats them contemptuously, they revile
not! If any one beats them, they are not enraged! If any one does them an injury, they pray
for him who has put them in pain! They have no enemy! They know nothing of cherishing
malice! They are guiltless of vain babbling! They have not learnt to utter a falsehood! They
cannot endure a false oath, or rather, they swear not at all, but would prefer to have their
tongue cut out, rather than to let an oath proceed out of their mouth!” Such are the things
which we should give them cause to say of us; and we should exterminate our evil habit of
oaths, and pay at least as much honour to God, as we do to our more valuable garments.
For how truly absurd is it, that when we have one garment better than the rest, we do not
suffer ourselves to be continually wearing it; and yet everywhere we draggle about the name
of God without concern, or ceremony! Let us not, I earnestly pray and beseech you, let us
not thus despise our own salvation; but the care which we have used respecting this precept
from the beginning, let us carry on even to the end. For I thus continually exhort you on
the subject of oaths, not as though condemning you of listlessness, but inasmuch as I have
seen that ye are for the most part reformed, I press you, and am urgent, that the whole work
should be finished off, and come to its perfection. Even so act the spectators of public games.
They excite those who are near the prize, with the more vehemence. Let us, then, by no
means become weary; for we have nearly reached the completion of this amendment; and
the difficulty was at the beginning. But now that the greater part of the evil habit has been
cut away, and less remains to correct, no labour is necessary, but we only need a moderate
degree of watchfulness, and diligence for some short time, in order that we ourselves being
amended, may also become instructors to others; and that we may behold the Holy Passover
with much confidence, and that with much pleasure we may reap a double or treble measure
of the customary gladness of the festival. For not so much does it delight us to be delivered
<note type="footnote">1431 See on Rom. xi. 6, Hom. XVIII.</note>
<note type="footnote">1432 Matt. v. 16.</note>

<pb n="585"/>
from the toil and fatigue of fasting, as to meet that holy season with an illustrious and wellearned
crown; a crown indeed that is never to fade!</p>
<p>11. But in order that the amendment may take place the more quickly, do this which I
tell thee. Inscribe upon the wall of thy house, and upon the wall of thy heart, that “flying
sickle;”1433 and think that it is flying forth on occasion of the curse, and constantly remember
it. And if thou observest another person swearing, restrain, forbid, and be careful for him,
and be careful for thine own domestics. For if we would look to this, that we might not
merely correct ourselves, but also bring others to the same point, we shall ourselves quickly
arrive at the goal; since while we undertake to instruct others, we shall be ashamed and
blush, should we in our own case seem to leave those things unperformed, which we enjoin
upon them. There is no need to say more; for much has been already spoken on these matters;
and these things are now said only by way of remembrance. But may God, who is more
sparing of our souls than we are, make us perfect in this, and every good work; that so having
completed the whole fruit of righteousness, we may be found worthy of the kingdom of
heaven, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom,
and with Whom, to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Commendation of those who came to hear after taking a meal.—Observations on the physiology
of the natural world; and against those who deify the creation; and on the duty of not
swearing.</p>
<p>1. I joy, and rejoice with you all, that ye have actually put in practice that admonition
of ours, which we lately made with respect to those who were absent, for the reason that
they were not fasting. For I think that many of those who have dined1434 are to-day present;
and go to fill up this goodly assemblage; and that this is the fact, I conjecture from the more
brilliant spectacle that I see around me, and the greater concourse of hearers. Not in vain,
it seems, did I lately1435 spend so many words on their account, appealing to your Charity,
to draw them to their Mother;1436 and to persuade them that it is lawful, even after bodily
nourishment, to partake also of that which is spiritual. And in which case, beloved, I ask,
did ye act for the better; at the time of the last assembly when after your meal ye turned to
your slumbers; or now, when after the meal ye have presented yourselves at the hearing of
the divine laws? Was it best when ye loitered about in the forum, and took part in meetings
which were no wise profitable; or now, when ye stand with your own brethren, and hear
the prophetic oracles? It is no disgrace, beloved, to have eaten, but after eating to remain at
home, and so to be deprived of this sacred banquet. For whilst thou remainest at home,
thou wilt be more slothful and supine; but coming here thou wilt shake off all slumber and
listlessness; and laying aside not only listlessness,1437 but also all sadness, thou wilt be more
at ease, and in better heart in all the events that may happen.</p>
<p>2. What need then is there to say more? Stand only nigh the man who fasts, and thou
wilt straightway partake of his good odour; for fasting is a spiritual perfume; and through
the eyes, the tongue, and every part, it manifests the good disposition of the soul. I have said
this, not for the purpose of condemning those who have dined, but that I may shew the advantage
of fasting. I do not, however, call mere abstinence from meats, fasting; but even
before this, abstinence from sin; since he who, after he has taken a meal, has come hither
with suitable sobriety, is not very far behind the man who fasts; even as he who continues
fasting, if he does not give earnest and diligent heed to what is spoken, will derive no great
benefit from his fast. He who eats, and yet takes a part in the sacred assembly with suitable

earnestness, is in much better case than he who eats not at all, and remains absent. This
abstinence will by no means be able to benefit us as much as the participation in spiritual
instruction conveyeth to us benefit and advantage. Where indeed, besides, wilt thou hear
the things upon which thou meditatest here? Wert thou to go to the bench of justice?
quarrels and contentions are there! or into the council-chamber? there is anxious thought
about political matters! or to thine home? solicitude on the subject of thy private affairs afflicts
thee in every direction! or wert thou to go to the conferences and debates of the forum?
every thing there is earthly and corruptible! For all the words that pass among those assembled
there, are concerning merchandize, or taxes, or the sumptuous table, or the sale of
lands, or other contracts, or wills, or inheritances, or some other things of that kind. And
shouldest thou enter even into the royal halls, there again thou wouldest hear in the same
way all discoursing of wealth, or power, or of the glory which is held in honour here, but of
nothing that is spiritual. But here on the contrary everything relates to heaven, and heavenly
things; to our soul, to our life, the purpose for which we were born, and why we spend an
allotted time upon earth, and on what terms we migrate from hence, and into what condition
we shall enter after these things, and why our body is of clay, what also is the nature of death,
what, in short, the present life is, and what the future. The discourses that are here made by
us contain nothing at all of an earthly kind, but are all in reference to spiritual things. Thus,
then, it is that we shall have made great provision for our salvation, and shall depart hence
with a good hope.</p>
<p>3. Since, therefore, we did not scatter the seed in vain, but ye hunted out all who were
absent, as I exhorted you; suffer us now to return you a recompense; and having reminded
you of a few things that were said before, to repay you again what remains. What then were
those matters that were before treated of? We were enquiring how, and in what manner,
before the giving of the Scriptures, God ordered His dispensation toward us; and we said,
that by means of the creation He instructed our race, stretching out the heavens, and there
openly unfolding a vast volume, useful alike to the simple and the wise, to the poor and to
the rich, to Scythians and to barbarians, and to all in general who dwell upon the earth; a
volume which is much larger than the multitude of those instructed by it. We discoursed
also at length concerning the night, and the day, and the order of these, as well as of the
harmony which is strictly preserved by them; and much was said respecting the measured
dance of the seasons of the year, and of their equality. For just as the day defraudeth not the
night even of half an hour throughout the whole year, so also do these distribute all the days
among themselves equally. But, as I said before, not only does the greatness and beauty of
the creation shew forth the Divine Architect, but the very manner likewise in which it is
compacted together, and the method of operation, transcending as it does, the ordinary
course of nature. For it would have been in accordance with nature for water to be borne
upon the earth; but now we see, on the contrary, that the earth is supported by the waters.

<pb n="588"/>
It would have been in accordance with nature that fire should tend upwards; but now on
the contrary we see the beams of the sun directed towards the earth; and the waters to be
above the heavens, yet not falling away;1438 and the sun running below them, yet not
quenched by the waters, nor dispelling their moisture. Besides these things we said that this
whole universe consists of four elements, these being adverse to and at strife with one another;
yet one does not consume the other, although they are mutually destructive. Whence
it is evident that some invisible power bridles them, and the will of God becomes their bond.</p>
<p>4. To-day, I wish to dwell a little more on this subject. Arouse yourselves, however, and
give earnest heed unto us! And that the wonder may appear more clearly, I will draw the
lesson concerning these things from our own bodies. This body of ours, so short, and small,
consists of four elements; viz. of what is warm, that is, of blood; of what is dry, that is, of
yellow bile; of what is moist, that is, of phlegm; of what is cold, that is, of black bile. And let
no one think this subject foreign to that which we have in hand. “For He that is spiritual
judgeth all things; yet He Himself is judged of no man.”1439 Thus also Paul touched upon
principles of agriculture, whilst discoursing to us of the Resurrection; and said, “Thou fool;
that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die.”1440 But if that blessed man brought
forward questions of agriculture, neither should any one blame us if we handle matters
pertaining to medical science. For our discourse is now respecting the Creation of God; and
this ground-work of ideas will be necessary for our purpose. As, therefore, I said before, this
body of ours consists of four elements; and if either revolts against the whole, death is the
result of this revolt. As for instance, by a superabundance “of bile” fever is produced; and
should this proceed beyond a certain measure, it effects a rapid dissolution. Again, when
there is an excess of the cold element, paralyses, agues, apoplexies, and an infinite number
of other maladies are generated. And every form of disease is the effect of an excess of these
elements; when either of them overpassing its own bounds, acts the part of a tyrant against
the rest, and mars the symmetry of the whole. Interrogate then him who says, that all things
are spontaneous and self-produced. If this little and diminutive body, having the advantage
of medicines, and of medical skill, and of a soul within which regulates it, and of much
moral wisdom, as well as innumerable other helps, be not always able to continue in a state
of order, but often perishes, and is destroyed, when some disturbance takes place within it;
how could a world like this, containing substances of such vast bulk and compounded of
those same elements, remain during so long a time without any disturbance, unless it enjoyed
the advantage of a manifold providence? Neither would it be reasonable to suppose that
this body, which has the benefit of superintendence both without and within, should scarcely

be sufficient for its own preservation; and that a world such as this is, enjoying no such superintendence,
should during so many years suffer nothing of that sort which our body
suffers. For how, I ask, is it that not one of these elements hath gone beyond its own
boundaries, nor swallowed up all the rest? Who hath brought them together from the begin-
ning? Who hath bound? Who hath bridled? Who hath held them together during so long
a period? For if the body of the world were simple and uniform, what I speak of would not
have been so impossible. But when there hath been such a strife between the elements, even
from the beginning; who so senseless as to think that these things would have come together,
and remained together when united, without One to effect this conjunction? For if we who
are evil-affected towards one another not by nature, but by will, cannot come spontaneously
to an agreement as long as we remain at variance, and hold ourselves ungraciously towards
one another; if we have yet need of some one else to bring us into a state of conjunction;
and after this conjunction further to clench us, and persuade us to abide by our reconciliation,
and not again to be at variance; how could the elements, which neither partake of sense nor
reason, and which are naturally adverse, and inimical to each other, have come together,
and agreed and remained with one another, if there were not some ineffable Power which
effected this conjunction; and after this conjunction, always restrained them by the same
bond?</p>
<p>5. Dost thou not perceive how this body wastes away, withers, and perishes after the
secession of the soul, and each of the elements thereof returns to its own appointed place?1441
This very same thing, indeed, would also happen to the world, if the Power which always
governs it had left it devoid of Its own providence. For if a ship does not hold together
without a pilot, but soon founders, how could the world have held together so long a time
if there was no one governing its course? And that I may not enlarge, suppose the world to
be a ship; the earth to be placed below as the keel; the sky to be the sail; men to be the passengers;
1442 the subjacent abyss, the sea. How is it then that during so long a time, no shipwreck
has taken place? Now let a ship go one day without a pilot and crew,1443 and thou
wilt see it straightway foundering! But the world, though subsisting now five thousand years,
and many more, hath suffered nothing of the kind. But why do I talk of a ship? Suppose one
hath pitched a small hut in the vineyards; and when the fruit is gathered, leaves it vacant; it
stands, however, scarce two or three days, but soon goes to pieces, and tumbles down! Could
not a hut, forsooth, stand without superintendence? How then could the workmanship of
a world, so fair and marvellous; the laws of the night and day; the interchanging dances of
the seasons; the course of nature chequered and varied as it is in every way throughout the

earth, the sea, the sky; in plants, and in animals that fly, swim, walk, creep; and in the race
of men, far more dignified than any of these, continue yet unbroken, during so long a period,
without some kind of providence? But in addition to what has been said, follow me whilst
I enumerate the meadows, the gardens, the various tribes of flowers; all sorts of herbs, and
their uses;1444 their odours, forms, disposition, yea, but their very names; the trees which
are fruitful, and which are barren; the nature of metals,—and of animals,—in the sea, or on
the land; of those that swim, and those that traverse the air; the mountains, the forests, the
groves; the meadow below, and the meadow above; for there is a meadow on the earth, and
a meadow too in the sky; the various flowers of the stars; the rose below, and the rainbow
above! Would you have me point out also the meadow of birds? Consider the variegated
body of the peacock, surpassing every dye, and the fowls of purple plumage.1445 Contemplate
with me the beauty of the sky; how it has been preserved so long without being dimmed;
and remains as bright and clear as if it had been only fabricated to-day; moreover, the power
of the earth, how its womb has not become effete by bringing forth during so long a time!
Contemplate with me the fountains; how they burst forth and fail not, since the time they
were begotten, to flow forth continually throughout the day and night! Contemplate with
me the sea, receiving so many rivers, yet never exceeding its measure! But how long shall
we pursue things unattainable! It is fit, indeed, that over every one of these which has been
spoken of, we should say, “O Lord, how hast Thou magnified Thy works; in wisdom hast
Thou made them all.”1446</p>
<p>6. But what is the sapient argument of the unbelievers, when we go over all these particulars
with them; the magnitude, the beauty of the creation, the prodigality, the munificence
everywhere displayed? This very thing, say they, is the worst fault, that God hath made the
world so beautiful and so vast. For if He had not made it beautiful and vast, we should not
have made a god of it; but now being struck with its grandeur, and marvelling at its beauty,
we have thought it to be a deity.1447 But such an argument is good for nothing. For that
neither the magnitude, nor beauty of the world is the cause of this impiety, but their own
want of understanding, is what we are prepared to show, proved by the case of ourselves,
who have never been so affected. Why then have “we” not made a deity of it? Do we not see
it with the same eyes as themselves? Do we not enjoy the same advantage from the creation

with themselves? Do we not possess the same soul? Have we not the same body? Do we not
tread the same earth? How comes it that this beauty and magnitude hath not persuaded us
to think the same as they do? But this will be evident not from this proof only, but from
another besides. For as a proof that it is not for its beauty they have made a deity of it, but
by reason of their own folly, why do they adore the ape, the crocodile, the dog, and the vilest
of animals? Truly, “they became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was
darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.”1448</p>
<p>7. Nevertheless, we will not frame our answer from these things only, but will also say
something yet further. For God, foreseeing these things of old, destroyed, in His wisdom,
this plea of theirs. On this account He made the world not only wonderful and vast, but also
corruptible and perishable; and placed therein many evidences of its weakness; and what
He did with respect to the Apostles,1449 He did with respect to the whole world. What then
did He with respect to the Apostles? Since they used to perform many great and astonishing
signs and wonders, He suffered them constantly to be scourged, to be expelled, to inhabit
the dungeon, to encounter bodily infirmities, to be in continual tribulations, lest the greatness
of their miracles should make them to be accounted as gods amongst mankind. Therefore
when He had bestowed so great favour upon them, He suffered their bodies to be mortal,
and in many cases obnoxious to disease; and did not remove their infirmity, that He might
give full proof of their nature. And this is not merely my assertion, but that of Paul himself,
who says, “For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; but now I forbear, lest
any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of
me.”1450 And again, “But we have this treasure in earthen vessels.”1451 But what is meant
by “earthen vessels?” In this body, he means, which is mortal and perishable. For just as the
earthen vessel is formed from clay and fire, so also the body of these saints being clay, and
receiving the energy of the spiritual fire, becomes an earthen vessel. But for what reason
was it thus constituted, and so great a treasure, and such a plentitude of graces entrusted to
a mortal and corruptible body? “That the excellency of the power may be of God, and not
of us.” For when thou seest the Apostles raising the dead, yet themselves sick, and unable
to remove their own infirmities, thou mayest clearly perceive, that the resurrection of the
dead man was not effected by the power of him who raised him, but by the energy of the
Spirit. For in proof, that they were frequently sick, hear what Paul saith respecting Timothy,
“Use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake, and thine often infirmities.”1452 And again, of an-

other he saith, “But Trophimus I have left at Miletus sick.”1453 And writing to the Philippians,
he said, “Epaphroditus was sick nigh unto death.”1454 For if, when this was the case, they
accounted them to be gods, and prepared to do sacrifice unto them, saying, “The gods are
come down to us in the likeness of men;”1455 had such infirmities not existed, to what extent
of impiety might not men have proceeded, when they beheld their miracles? As then in this
case, because of the greatness of these signs, He suffered their nature to remain in a state of
infirmity, and permitted those repeated trials, in order that they might not be thought to
be gods, thus likewise He did with respect to the creation, a thing nearly parallel to this. For
He fashioned it beautiful and vast; but on the other hand corruptible.</p>
<p>8. And both of these points the Scriptures teach, for one in treating of the beauty of the
heavens thus speaks; “The heavens declare the glory of God.”1456 And again, “Who hath
placed the sky as a vault,1457 and spread it out as a tent over the earth.”1458 And again, “Who
holdeth the circle of heaven.”1459 But another writer, shewing that although the world be
great and fair, it is yet corruptible, thus speaks; “Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the
foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Thine hands. They shall perish,
but Thou remainest, and they all shall wax old as doth a garment, and as a vesture shalt
Thou fold them up, and they shall be changed.”1460 And again, David saith of the sun, that
“he is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a giant to run his
course.”1461 Seest thou how he places before thee the beauty of this star, and its greatness?
For even as a bridegroom when he appears from some stately chamber,1462 so the sun sends
forth his rays under the East; and adorning the heaven as it were with a saffron-coloured
veil, and making the clouds like roses, and running unimpeded all the day; he meets no
obstacle to interrupt his course. Beholdest thou, then, his beauty? Beholdest thou his greatness?
Look also at the proof of his weakness! For a certain wise man, to make this plain,
said, “What is brighter than the sun, yet the light thereof suffers eclipse.”1463 Nor is it only

from this circumstance that his infirmity is to be perceived, but also in the concourse of the
clouds. Often, at least, when a cloud passes underneath him, though emitting his beams,
and endeavouring to pierce through it, he has not strength to do so; the cloud being too
dense, and not suffering him to penetrate through it. “He nourishes the seeds, however,”1464
replies some one—Yes—still he does not nourish them by himself, but requires the assistance
of the earth, and of the dew, and of the rains, and of the winds, and the right distribution
of the seasons. And unless all these things concur, the sun’s aid is but superfluous. But this
would not seem to be like a deity, to stand in need of the assistance of others, for that which
he wishes to do; for it is a special attribute of God to want nothing; He Himself at least did
not in this manner bring forth the seeds from the ground; He only commanded, and they
all shot forth. And again, that thou mayest learn that it is not the nature of the elements,
but His command which effects all things; He both brought into being these very elements
which before were not; and without the need of any aid, He brought down the manna for
the Jews. For it is said, “He gave them bread from heaven.”1465 But why do I say, that in
order to the perfection of fruits, the sun requires the aid of other elements for their sustenance;
when he himself requires the assistance of many things for his sustenance, and would
not himself be sufficient for himself. For in order that he may proceed on his way, he needs
the heaven as a kind of pavement spread out underneath him; and that he may shine, he
needs the clearness and rarity of the air; since if even this become unusually dense, he is not
able to show his light; and, on the other hand, he requires coolness and moisture, lest his
rays should be intolerable to all, and burn up everything. When, therefore, other elements
overrule him, and correct his weakness (overrule as for example, clouds, and walls, and
certain other bodies that intercept his light:—or correct his excess, as the dews, and fountains,
and cool air), how can such a one be a Deity? For God must be independent, and not stand
in need of assistance, be the source of all good things to all, and be hindered by nothing;
even as Paul, as well as the prophet Isaiah, saith of God; the latter1466 thus making Him
speak in His own Person, “I fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord.”1467 And again, “Am I a
God nigh at hand, and not a God afar off?”1468 And again, David says, “I have said unto the
Lord, Thou art my Lord, for Thou hast no need of my good things.”1469 But Paul, demonstrating
this independence of help, and shewing that both these things especially belong to

God; to stand in need of nothing, and of Himself to supply all things to all; speaks on this
wise, “God that made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, Himself needeth not any thing,
giving to all life and all things.”1470</p>
<p>9. It would indeed be easy for us to take a survey of the other elements, the heaven, the
air, the earth, the sea, and to shew the imbecility of these, and how each requires the assistance
of his neighbour, and without this assistance, is lost and destroyed. For as it regards the
earth, if the fountains fail it, and the moisture infused from the sea and the rivers, it quickly
perishes by being parched. The remaining elements too stand in need of one another, the
air of the sun, as well as the sun of the air. But not to protract this discourse; in what has
been said, having given a sufficient supply of reasons to start from for those who are willing
to receive them, we shall be content. For if the sun, which is the most surprising part of the
whole creation, hath been proved to be so feeble and needy, how much more the other parts
of the universe? What then I have advanced (offering these things for the consideration of
the studious), I will myself again shew you in discourse from the Scriptures; and prove, that
not only the sun, but also the whole universe is thus corruptible. For since the elements are
mutually destructive, and when much cold intervenes, it chastens the force of the sun’s rays;
and on the other hand, the heat prevailing, consumes the cold; and since the elements are
both the causes and subjects of contrary qualities, and dispositions, in one another; it is very
evident that these things offer a proof of great corruptibility; and of the fact, that all these
things which are visible, are a corporeal substance.</p>
<p>10. But since this subject is too lofty for our simplicity, permit me now to lead you to
the sweet fountain of the Scriptures, that we may refresh your ears. For we will not discourse
to you of the heaven and the earth separately, but will exhibit the Apostle declaring this very
thing to us concerning the whole creation, in these plain terms, that the whole creation is
now in bondage to corruption; and why it is thus in bondage, and at what time it shall be
delivered from it, and unto what condition it shall be translated. For after he had said, “The
sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be
revealed in us;” he goes on to add; “For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for
the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly,
but by reason of Him who hath subjected the same in hope.”1471 But what he intends
is to this effect; “The creature,” he says, “was made corruptible;” for this is implied in the
expression, “being made subject to vanity.” For it was made corruptible by the command
of God. But God so commanded it for the sake of our race; for since it was to nurture a
corruptible man, it was necessary itself should also be of the same character; for of course
corruptible bodies were not to dwell in an incorruptible creation. But, nevertheless, he tells
<note type="footnote">1470 Acts xvii. 25. Here also St. Chrysostom quotes from memory, as the first clause shows.</note>
<note type="footnote">1471 Rom. viii. 21.</note>

<pb n="595"/>
us, it will not remain so. “The creature1472 also itself shall be delivered from the bondage
of corruption;” and afterwards, for the purpose of shewing when this event shall take place,
and through whom, he adds, “Into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.” For when we
are raised, his meaning is, and assume incorruptible bodies; then also this body of the
heaven, the earth, and the whole creation, shall be incorruptible, and imperishable. When,
therefore, thou beholdest the sun arising, admire the Creator; when thou beholdest him
hiding himself and disappearing, learn the weakness of his nature, that thou mayest not
adore him as a Deity! For God hath not only implanted in the nature of the elements this
proof of their weakness, but hath also bidden His servants, that were but men, command
them; so that although thou shouldest not know their servitude from their aspect, thou
mayest learn, from those who have commanded them, that they are all thy fellow-servants.
Therefore it was, that Joshua, the son of Nave,1473 said, “Let the sun stand still in Gibeon,
and the moon over against the valley of Ajalon.” And again the prophet Isaiah made the
sun to retrace his steps, under the reign of Hezekiah; and Moses gave orders to the air, and
the sea, the earth, and the rocks. Elisha changed the nature of the waters; the Three Children
triumphed over the fire. Thou seest how God hath provided for us on either hand; leading
us by the beauty of the elements to the knowledge of His divinity; and, by their feebleness,
not permitting us to lapse into the worship of them.</p>
<p>11. For the sake of all these things then, let us glorify Him, our Guardian; not only by
words, but also by deeds; and let us shew forth an excellent conversation, not only in general,
but in particular with regard to abstinence from oaths. For not every sin brings the same
penalty; but those which are easiest to be amended, bring upon us the greatest punishment:
which indeed Solomon intimated, when he said, “It is not wonderful if any one be taken
stealing; for he stealeth that he may satisfy his soul that is hungry; but the adulterer, by the
lack of understanding, destroyeth his own soul.”1474 But what he means is to this effect. The
thief is a grievous offender, but not so grievous a one as the adulterer: for the former, though
it be a sorry reason for his conduct, yet at the same time has to plead the necessity arising
from indigence; but the latter, when no necessity compels him, by his mere madness rushes
into the gulph of iniquity. This also may be said with regard to those who swear. For they
have not any pretext to allege, but merely their contempt.</p>

<p>12. I know, indeed, that I may seem to be too tedious and burdensome; and that I may
be thought to give annoyance by continuing this admonition. But nevertheless, I do not
desist, in order that ye may even be shamed by my shamelessness to abstain from the cus
tom of oaths. For if that unmerciful and cruel judge, paying respect to the importunity of
the widow, changed his custom, much more will ye do this; and especially when he who is
exhorting you, doth it not for himself, but for your salvation. Or rather, indeed, I cannot
deny that I do this for myself; for I consider your benefit as my own success. But I could
wish that you, even as I labour, and weary myself for your safety, would in like manner make
your own souls a matter of anxiety to yourselves; and then assuredly this work of reformation
would be perfected. And what need is there to multiply words? For if there were no hell,
neither punishment for the contumacious, nor reward for the obedient; and I had come to
you, and asked this in the way of a favour, would ye not have consented? would ye not have
granted my petition, when I asked so trifling a favour? But when it is God who asks this favour,
and for the sake of yourselves, who are to grant it, and not for Himself, Who is to receive
it; who is there so ungracious, who is there so miserable and wretched, that he will not grant
this favour to God, when He asks it; and especially when he himself who grants it, is in future
to enjoy the benefit of it? Considering these things then, repeat over to yourselves, when ye
depart hence, all that has been said; and correct in every way those who take no heed to it;
to the end that we may receive the recompense of other men’s good actions, as well as our
own, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom, and with
Whom be glory to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving to God for deliverance from the evils expected owing to the sedition; and recollection
of the events which took place at the time. Also against those who find fault with
the structure of the human body, and in general concerning the creation of man; and, in
conclusion, on success in avoiding oaths.</p>
<p>1. When I think of the past tempest, and of the present calm, I cease not saying, “Blessed
be God, who maketh all things, and changeth them; who hath brought light out of darkness;
who leadeth to the gates of hell, and bringeth back; who chastiseth, but killeth not.”1475 And
this I desire you too to repeat constantly, and never to desist. For if He hath benefitted us
by deeds, what pardon shall we deserve, if we do not requite Him even by words. Therefore,
I exhort that we never cease to give Him thanks; since if we are grateful for the former benefits,
it is plain that we shall enjoy others also, which are greater. Let us say, then, continually,
Blessed be God, who hath permitted us to spread before you in security the accustomed
table, whilst He hath also granted you to hear our word with assurance of safety! Blessed be
God, that we no longer run hither flying from the danger without, but only from desire to
hear; that we no longer meet one another with agony, trembling, and anxious thoughts; but
with much confidence, having shaken off all our fear. Our condition, indeed, on former
days was nothing better than that of those who are tossed up and down in the midst of the
deep; and expecting shipwreck every hour. We were scared all day long by innumerable
rumours, and disturbed and agitated on every side; and were every day busy and curious to
know who had come from the court?1476 what news he had brought? and whether what was
reported was true or false? Our nights too we passed without sleep, and whilst we looked
upon the city, we wept over it, as if it were on the eve of its destruction.</p>
<p>2. For this cause yourselves too kept silence on those former days, because the whole
city was empty, and all had migrated to the deserts, and because those who were left behind
were overshadowed1477 by the cloud of despondency. For the soul when once it is filled
with despondency, is not apt to hear anything that may be said. For this cause, when the
friends of Job came, and saw that tragedy of his house, and the just man sitting down upon
the dunghill, and covered with sores, they rent their garments, and groaned and sat down
by him in silence; making it manifest that nothing is so suitable to the afflicted at first, as
quiet and silence. For the calamity was too great for consolation. Therefore also the Jews,
whilst they were in bondage to work in clay and the brick-making, when they saw Moses
come to them, were not able to give heed to his words, by reason of their failure of spirit,

and their affliction. And what marvel is it that faint-hearted men have felt this, when we
find that the Disciples also fell into the same infirmity. For after that mystic Supper, when
Christ took1478 them apart and discoursed with them, the disciples at first asked Him more
than once, “Whither goest Thou?” But when He had told them what evils they should in a
little while afterwards encounter, the wars, and the persecutions, and the universal enmity,
the stripes, the prisons, the tribunals, the appearance before magistrates; then, their souls
oppressed as by a heavy burthen with the dread of the things He had spoken, and with the
sadness of these approaching events, remained henceforth in a state of stupor. Christ,
therefore, perceiving their consternation, reproved it by saying, “I go to My Father, and no
one among you asketh Me, Whither goest Thou? But because I have said these things unto
you, sorrow hath filled your hearts.” For this reason also we were silent for some time past,
awaiting the present opportunity. For if a person who is about to ask a favour of any one,
though the request be a reasonable one, waits a fitting occasion to propose it, that he may
find him who is to grant the petition in a mild and well-disposed frame of mind; and that
receiving assistance from the favourable opportunity, he may obtain the benefit; how much
rather is it necessary that the speaker should seek a fit season, so that he may address his
discourse to an auditor well affected, and free from all care and despondency; which accordingly
we have done.</p>
<p>3. Inasmuch, then, as ye have now shaken off despondency, we are desirous to recall
you to the recollection of former matters; so that our discourse may be rendered the clearer
to you. For what we said of the creation, that God not only made it beautiful, and wonderful,
and vast, but also weak and corruptible; and moreover that He hath established divers proofs
of this; ordering both these circumstances for our advantage; leading us on by its beauty to
admiration of Him who framed it: and by its weakness leading us away from the worship
of the creature; this we may see, take place also in the case of the body. For with respect to
this too there are many among the enemies to the truth, as well as among those who belong
to our own ranks, who make it a subject of enquiry, why it was created corruptible and frail?
Many also of the Greeks and heretics affirm, that it was not even created by God.1479 For
they declare it to be unworthy of God’s creative art, and enlarge upon its impurities, its
sweat, its tears, its labours, and sufferings, and all the other incidents of the body. But, for
my part, when such things are talked of, I would first make this reply. Tell me not of man,
<note type="footnote">1478 Or, “had” (λαβῶν, which may refer to Judas’ going out). John xiii. 31. For it is plain they did not go out
until the end of the discourse. John xviii. 1.</note>
<note type="footnote">1479 Plato, in his Timæus, 40, d. 42e., makes the human body the work of (good) demons, or created gods,
because it would have been of a more perfect nature if the Supreme God had made it. Of heretics who held such
opinions as are here mentioned, see Rom. viii. 5–7, Hom. XIII. Valentinus, Marcion, Basilides, and other early
heretics of the Gnostic school, held matter to be evil, and the world made by evil beings.</note>

fallen, degraded and condemned. But if thou wouldest learn what manner of body God
formed us with at the first, let us go to Paradise, and survey the Man that was created at the
beginning. For that body was not thus corruptible and mortal; but like as some statue of
gold just brought from the furnace, that shines splendidly, so that frame was free from all
corruption. Labour did not trouble it, nor sweat deface it. Cares did not conspire against it;
nor sorrows besiege it; nor was there any other affection of that kind to distress it. But when
man did not bear his felicity with moderation, but threw contempt upon his Benefactor,
and thought a deceiving demon more worthy of credit than God who cared for him, and
who had raised him to honour, and when he expected to become himself a god, and conceived
thoughts above his proper dignity, then,—then indeed it was that God, to humble him by
decisive acts, made him mortal, as well as corruptible; and fettered him with such varied
necessities; not from hatred or aversion, but in care for him, and to repress at the very outset
that evil and destructive pride; and instead of permitting it to proceed any further, He admonished
Him by actual experience, that he was mortal and corruptible; thus to convince
him that he must never again think or dream of such things as he had done. For the devil’s
suggestion, was, “Ye shall be as gods.”1480 Desiring then utterly to eradicate this idea, God
made the body subject to much suffering and disease; to instruct him by its very nature that
he must never again entertain such a thought. And that this is true, is really most evident
from what befel him; for after such an expectation, he was condemned to this punishment.
Consider also with me the wisdom1481 of God in this matter. He did not allow him to be
the first to die, but permitted his son to suffer this death; in order that seeing before his eyes
the body corrupting and decaying, he might receive a striking lesson of wisdom1482 from
that spectacle; and learn what had come to pass, and be duly chastened before he departed
hence.</p>
<p>4. Really then, as I said, this point is apparent from what has already taken place; but it
will be made no less clear from what yet remains to be stated. For if whilst we are fettered
with such necessities of the body; and whilst it is the lot of all men to die, to suffer corruption,
to moulder in the sight of all, and to dissolve into dust, so that the Gentile philosophers
made one and the same comprehensive definition of the human race (for when asked what
man was, they answered, he is an animal, rational and mortal); if, forsooth, whilst all admitted
this, there were some who dared in the opinion of the multitude to immortalize themselves;
and notwithstanding that the very sense of sight bore witness to their mortality, were ambitious
to be called gods, and were honoured as such; to what a length of impiety would not
many men have proceeded, if death had not gone on teaching all men the mortality and

corruptibility of our nature? Hear, for instance, what the prophet says of a barbarian king,
when seized with this frenzy. “I will exalt,” saith he, “my throne above the stars of heaven;
and I will be like unto the Most High.”1483 Afterwards, deriding him, and speaking of his
death, he says, “Corruption is under thee, and the worm is thy covering;”1484 but his
meaning is, “Dost thou dare, O man, whom such an end is awaiting, to entertain such imaginations?”
Again, of another, I mean the king of the Tyrians, when he conceived the like
aims, and was ambitious to be considered as a God, he says, “Thou art not a God, but a man,
and they that pierce thee shall say so.”1485 Thus God, in making this body of ours as it is,
hath from the beginning utterly taken away all occasion of idolatry.</p>
<p>5. But why dost thou marvel if this hath happened in respect to the body, when even
with respect to the soul it is plain, that a similar thing hath taken place. For God made it
not mortal, but permitted it to be immortal; He constituted it however subject to forgetfulness,
to ignorance, to sadness, and to care; and this, lest regarding its own nobility of birth,
it might take up a conceit too high for its proper dignity. For if, even while the case stands
thus, some have dared to aver, that it is of the Divine essence; to what a pitch of frenzy would
they not have reached, if it had been devoid of these imperfections? What, however, I affirmed
respecting the creation, I affirm also respecting the body, that both these things alike excite
my admiration of God; that He hath made it corruptible; and that in its very corruptibility,
He hath manifested His own power and wisdom. For that He could have made it of some
better material, He hath evidenced from the celestial and the solar substance. For He that
made those such as they are, could have made this also like them, had He thought proper
to do so. But the cause of its imperfection is what I before adverted to. This circumstance
by no means lowers the admiration due to the Creator’s workmanship, but rather increases
it; for the meanness of the substance, manifests the resource and adaptiveness of His art;
since He hath introduced such a harmony of parts in clay and ashes, and senses so various
and manifold and capable of such spiritual wisdom.</p>
<p>6. In proportion, therefore, as thou findest fault with the meanness of the substance, be
so much the more astonished at the greatness of the art displayed. For this reason also, I do
not so much admire the statuary who forms a beautiful figure out of gold, as him who, by
the resources of art, is able, even in crumbling clay, to exhibit a marvellous and inimitable
mould of beauty. In the former case, the material gives some aid to the artist, but in the latter,
there is a naked display of his art. Wouldest thou learn then, how great the wisdom of the
Creator is, consider what it is that is made out of clay? What else is there but brick and tile?
Nevertheless, God, the Supreme Artist, from the same material of which only the brick and

tile is formed, hath been able to make an eye so beautiful, as to astonish all who behold it,
and to implant in it such power, that it can at once survey the high aerial expanse, and by
the aid of a small pupil embrace the mountains, forests, hills, the ocean, yea, the heaven, by
so small a thing! Tell me not then of tears and rheums, for these things are the fruit of thy
sin; but consider its beauty, and visual power; and how it is that whilst it ranges over such
an expanse of air, it experiences no weariness or distress! The feet indeed become tired and
weakened even after going but a small distance; but the eye, in traversing a space so lofty
and so wide, is not sensible of any infirmity. For since this is the most necessary to us of all
our members, He has not suffered it to be oppressed with fatigue; in order that the service
it renders us might be free and unfettered.</p>
<p>7. But rather, I should say, what language is fully adequate to set forth the whole excellency
of this member? And why do I speak of the pupil and the visual faculty? for if you
were to investigate that which seems the meanest of all the members, I mean the eyelashes,
you would behold even in these the manifold wisdom of God the Creator! For as it is with
respect to the ears of corn; the beards, standing forth as a sort of spears, repel the birds, and
do not suffer them to settle upon the fruits, and to break the stalk, which is too tender to
bear them; so also is it with regard to the eyes. The hairs of the eyelids are ranged in front,
and answer the purpose of beards and spears; keeping dust and light substances at a distance
from the eyes, and any thing that might incommode the sight; and not permitting the eyelids
to be annoyed. Another instance of wisdom, no less remarkable, is to be observed in eyebrows.
Who can help being struck by their position? For they do not project to an immoderate
degree, so as to obscure the sight; nor do they retire farther back than is fitting; but in the
same manner as the eaves of a house, they stand out above, receiving the perspiration as it
descends from the forehead, and not permitting it to annoy the eyes. For this purpose too
there is a growth of hair upon them, which serves by its roughness to stay what descends
from above, and affords the exact protection that is needed, and contributes also much appearance
of beauty to the eyes. Nor is this the only matter of wonder! There is another thing
also which is equally so. How is it, I ask, that the hairs of the head increase, and are cut off;
but those of the eyebrows, not so? For not even this has happened undesignedly, or by
chance, but in order that they might not darken the sight too much by becoming very long;
an inconvenience from which those suffer who have arrived at extreme old age.</p>
<p>8. And who could possibly trace out all the wisdom which is manifested by means of
the brain! For, in the first place, He made it soft, since it serves as a fountain to all the senses.
Next, in order that it might not suffer injury owing to its peculiar nature, He fortified it on
every side with bones. Further; that it might not suffer from friction, by the hardness of the
bones, He interposed a middle membrane: and not only a single one, but also a second; the
former being spread out on the under side of the skull, but the latter enveloping the upper
substance of the brain, and the first being the harder of the two. And this was done, both

<pb n="602"/>
for the cause that has been mentioned, and in order that the brain might not be the first to
receive the blows inflicted upon the head; but that these membranes first encountering
them, might free it from all injury, and preserve it unwounded. Moreover, that the bone
which covers the brain is not a single and continuous one, but has many sutures on every
side, is a circumstance which contributes much to its security. For a ventilation of the vapours
that surround it may easily take place outward through these sutures, so as to prevent it
from being suffocated;1486 and if a blow should be inflicted upon it, on any particular point,
the damage does not extend to the whole. For if the bone had been one and continuous, the
stroke even when it fell upon one part, only, would have injured the whole; but now, by its
being divided into many parts, this can never happen. For if one part should chance to be
wounded, only the bone that is situated near that part receives injury, but all the rest remain
unhurt; the continuity of the stroke being intercepted by the division of the bones, and being
unable to extend itself to the adjacent parts. By reason of this God hath constructed a covering
for the brain of many bones; and just as when one builds a house, he lays on a roof, and tiles
upon the upper part, so God hath placed these bones above upon the head, and hath provided
that the hairs should shoot forth, and serve as a kind of cap for it.</p>
<p>9. The very same thing also He hath done with regard to the heart. For inasmuch as the
heart has preeminence over all the members in our body, and that the supreme power over
our whole life is entrusted to it, and death happens when it receives but a slight blow; He
hath fenced it about on every side with stiff and hard bones, surrounding it by the protection
of the breast-bone1487 before, and the blade-bones1488 behind. And what He did with respect
to the membranes of the brain, He hath done in this instance also. For in order that it might
not be rubbed and pained in striking against the hard bones which encompass it, in the
throbbing and quick pulsation to which it is subject in anger and similar affections, He both
interposed many membranes there, and placed the lungs by the side of it to act the part of
a soft bed to these pulsations, so that the heart may break its force on these without sustaining
injury or distress.</p>
<p>But why do I speak of the heart, and of the brain, when if any one will investigate even
the very nails, he will see the manifold wisdom of God displayed in these; as well by their
form, as by their substance and position. I might also have mentioned why our fingers are
not all equal, and many other particulars besides; but to those who are inclined to attend,
the wisdom of God Who created us, will be sufficiently clear from what has been said.

Wherefore, leaving this department to be investigated with diligence by those who are desirous
of the task, I shall turn myself to another objection.</p>
<p>10. There are many forsooth, who, besides what has been already referred to, bring
forward this objection. If man be the king of the brutes, why have many animals an advantage
over him in strength, agility, and fleetness? For the horse is swifter, the ox is more enduring,
the eagle is lighter, and the lion stronger, than man. What then have we to reply to this argument?
Thus much; that from that circumstance we may especially discern the wisdom of
God and the honour which He has put upon us. A horse, it is true, is swifter than man, but
for making dispatch on a journey, the man is better fitted than the horse. For a horse, though
the very swiftest and strongest that may be, can scarcely travel two hundred stadia in a
day;1489 but a man, harnessing a number of horses in succession, will be able to accomplish
a distance of two thousand stadia. Thus, the advantage which swiftness affords to the horse,
intelligence and art afford to the man in a much greater excess. The man, it is true, has not
feet so strong as the other, but then he has those of the other which serve him as well as his
own. For not one of the brutes has ever been able to subjugate another to his own use; but
man has the range of them all; and by that variety of skill which is given him of God, makes
each of the animals subservient to the employment best suited to him. For if the feet of men
had been as strong as those of horses, they would have been useless for other purposes, for
difficult ground, for the summits of mountains, for climbing trees; for the hoof is usually
an impediment to treading in such places. So that although the feet of men are softer than
theirs, they are still adapted to more various uses, and are not the worse for their want of
strength, while they have the power of the horse ministering to their aid, and at the same
time they have the advantage over him in variety of tread. Again, the eagle has his light
pinion; but I have reason and art, by which I am enabled to bring down and master all the
winged animals. But if thou wouldest see my pinion too, I have one much lighter than he;
one which can soar, not merely ten or twenty stadia, or even as high as heaven, but above
heaven itself, and above the heaven of heavens; even to “where Christ sitteth at the right
hand of God!”1490</p>
<p>11. Again, the irrational animals have their weapons in their own body; thus, the ox has
his horns; the wild boar his tusks; the lion his claws. But God hath not furnished the nature
of my body with weapons, but hath made these to be extraneous to it, for the purpose of
shewing that man is a gentle animal; and that I have not always occasion to use my weapons,
<note type="footnote">1489 He must mean for a continuance, as the stadium was rather less than our furlong. The word harnessing,
ὑποζεύξας, seems to imply a vehicle. It is very likely that the persons mentioned had not the advantage of relays
of draught horses. Some read here “a thousand,” for “two thousand;” see note of Ducæus.</note>
<note type="footnote">1490 Col. iii. 1. So again Hom. XV. (3). Compare the lines in one of Wesley’s hymns, “And on the eagle wings
of love, To joys celestial rise.”</note>

<pb n="604"/>
for from time to time I lay these aside, and from time to time resume them. In order then
that I might be free and unfettered in this matter, not being at all times compelled to carry
my weapons, He hath made these to be separate from my nature. For it is not only in our
possessing a rational nature that we surpass the brutes, but we also excel them in body. For
God has made this to correspond with the soul’s nobility, and fitted to execute its commands.
He has not, indeed, made the body such as it is, without reason; but such as it ought to be,
as having to minister to a rational soul; so that if it were not such as it is, the operations of
the soul would be greatly impeded: and this is manifest from diseases. For if this nice adjustment
of the body be diverted from its proper condition in ever so small a degree, many of
the soul’s energies are impeded; as, for instance, if the brain should become too hot, or too
cold. So that from the body it is easy to see much of the Divine Providence, not only because
He made it at first better than it is at present; nor because even now He hath changed it for
a useful purpose, but also because He will raise it again to much greater glory.</p>
<p>12. But, if thou art desirous to learn in a different way what wisdom God hath shewn
respecting the body, I will mention that by which Paul seems most especially to be constantly
struck. But what is this? That He hath made the members to excel one another, though not
in the same things? Some He hath appointed to surpass the rest in beauty, and some in
strength. Thus, the eye is beautiful, but the feet are stronger. The head is honourable, but it
cannot say to the feet, “I have no need of you.”1491 And this may be seen too with regard to
irrational animals; and the same in all the relations of life. The king, for instance, has need
of his subjects, and the subjects of the king; just as the head has need of the feet. And again,
as to brutes; some are more powerful than the rest; and some more beautiful. Some there
are that delight us; some that nourish; and some that clothe us. Thus the peacock delights;
and fowls and swine nourish; sheep and goats provide us clothing; and the ox and ass share
our labours. There are also others which provide us with none of these, but which call our
powers into active exercise. Thus the wild animals increase the strength of the hunters; and
instruct our race by the fear which they inspire, and render us more cautious; and for
medical purposes, they supply no small contributions from their bodies.1492 So that if any
one say to thee, “How art thou a lord of the brutes, whilst afraid of the lion?” Answer him,
“Things were not ordered in this manner at the beginning, when I was in favour with God,
when I dwelt in Paradise. But when I had offended my Master, I fell under the power of
those who were my servants! Yet not even now entirely; since I possess an art by which I
overcome the wild animals.” So also it happens in great houses; the sons, while they are yet
under age, are afraid of many of the servants; but when they have done amiss, their dread
<note type="footnote">1491 1 Cor. xii. 21.</note>
<note type="footnote">1492 See Hom. VIII. 1.</note>

<pb n="605"/>
is greatly heightened. And this we may say also of serpents, and scorpions, and vipers; that
they are formidable to us by reason of sin.</p>
<p>13. And not only as it regards our body, and the various states of life, is this diversity
observable; nor is it confined to brutes; but it may be seen also in trees; and the meanest of
them may be observed to have an excellence above those which are greater; so that all things
are not alike in all, that all may be necessary to us; and that we may perceive the manifold
wisdom of the Lord. Do not then lay blame on God on account of the body’s corruptibleness,
but for this the rather do Him homage, and admire Him for His wisdom and His tender
care; His wisdom, that in so corruptible a body He hath been able to display such harmony;
His tender care that for the benefit of the soul He hath made it corruptible, that He might
repress her vanity, and subdue her pride! Why then did He not make it thus from the beginning,
asks some one? It was, I reply, to justify Himself before thee by these very works; and
as much as to say by the result itself, “I called thee to greater honour, but thou didst constitute
thyself unworthy of the gift, banishing thyself from Paradise! Nevertheless, I will not even
now despise thee, but I will correct thy sin, and bring thee back1493 to heaven. Therefore
for thine own sake, I have permitted thee so long to decay and suffer corruption, that in the
fulness of time the discipline of thy humility might be established; and that thou mightest
never more resume thy former conceit.</p>
<p>14. For all these things then let us give thanks to God who loveth man; and for His
tender care over us, render Him a recompense, that will also be profitable to ourselves; and
as regards the commandment which I so frequently discourse of to you, let us use our utmost
diligence! For I will not desist from the exhortation until ye are amended: seeing that what
we aim at is not that we may address you seldom or frequently, but that we may continue
speaking till we have persuaded you. To the Jews when God said by the prophet, “If ye fast
for strife and debate, to what purpose do ye fast for me?”1494 And by us He saith to you, “If
ye fast unto oaths and perjuries, to what purpose do ye fast? For how shall we behold the
sacred Passover? How shall we receive the holy Sacrifice? How shall we be partakers of those
wonderful mysteries by means of the same tongue with which we have trampled upon God’s
law, the same tongue with which we have contaminated the soul? For if no one would dare
to receive the royal purple with filthy hands, how shall we receive the Lord’s Body with a
tongue that has become polluted! For the oath is of the wicked one, but the Sacrifice is of
the Lord. “What communion then hath light with darkness, and what concord hath Christ
with Belial?”1495</p>

<p>15. That ye are desirous, indeed, to be rid of this impiety, I know well; but since each
man may not be able easily to accomplish this by himself, let us enter into fraternities and
partnerships in this matter; and as the poor do in their feasts,1496 when each one alone
would not be able to furnish a complete banquet; when they all meet together, they each
bring their contribution to the feast; so also let us act. Inasmuch as we are of ourselves too
listless, let us make partnerships with each other, and pledge ourselves to contribute counsel,
and admonition, and exhortation, and rebuke and reminiscence, and threatening; in order
that from the diligence of each we may all be amended. For seeing that we observe the affairs
of our neighbour more sharply than we do our own, let us be watchful of the safety of others,
and commit the guardianship of ourselves to them; and let us engage in this pious rivalry,
to the end that thus becoming superior to such an evil habit, we may come with boldness
to this holy feast; and be partakers of the holy Sacrifice, with a favourable hope and a good
conscience; through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom and
with whom, be glory to the Father, with the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving to God for the pardon granted to the offenders against the Emperor. Physical
discourse on the Creation. Proof that God, in creating man, implanted in him a natural
law. Duty of avoiding oaths with the utmost diligence.</p>
<p>1. Yesterday I said “Blessed be God!” and to-day again I say the very same thing. For
although the evils we dreaded have passed away, we should not suffer the memory of them
to disappear; not indeed that we may grieve, but that we may give thanks. For if the memory
of these terrors abide with us, we shall never be overtaken by the actual experience of such
terrors. For what need have we of the experience, whilst our memory acts the part of a
monitor? Seeing then that God hath not permitted us to be overwhelmed in the flood of
those troubles when upon us, let us not permit ourselves to become careless when these are
passed away. Then, when we were sad, He consoled us, let us give thanks to Him now that
we are joyful. In our agony He comforted us, and did not forsake us; therefore let us not
betray ourselves in prosperity by declining into sloth. “Forget not,” saith one, “the time of
famine in the day of plenty.”1497 Therefore let us be mindful of the time of temptation in
the day of relief; and with respect to our sins let us also act in the same manner. If thou hast
sinned, and God hath pardoned thy sin, receive thy pardon, and give thanks; but be not
forgetful of the sin; not that thou shouldest fret thyself with the thought of it, but that thou
mayest school thy soul, not to grow wanton, and relapse again into the same snares.1498</p>
<p>2. Thus also Paul did; for having said, “He counted me faithful, putting me into the
ministry,” he goes on to add, “who was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and injurious.”1499
“Let the life of the servant,” saith he, “be openly exposed, so that the lovingkindness of the
Master be apparent. For although I have received the remission of sins, I do not reject the
memory of those sins.” And this not only manifested the lovingkindness of the Lord, but
made the man himself the more illustrious. For when thou hast learnt who he was before,
then thou wilt be the more astonished at him; and when thou seest out of what he came to
be what he was, then thou wilt commend him the more; and if thou hast greatly sinned, yet
upon being changed thou wilt conceive favourable hopes from this instance. For in addition
to what has been said, such an example comforts those who are in despair, and causes them
again to stand erect. The same thing also will be the case with regard to our city; for all the
events that have happened serve to shew your virtue, who by means of repentance have
prevailed to ward off such wrath, whilst at the same time they proclaim the lovingkindness
of God, who has removed the cloud that was so threatening, in consequence of a small

from our case, that he who looks upward for the Divine help, is not to be overwhelmed,
though innumerable waves should encompass him on all sides.</p>
<p>3. For who hath seen, who hath ever heard of sufferings such as were ours? We were
every day in expectation that our city would be overturned from its foundations together
with its inhabitants. But when the Devil was hoping to sink the vessel, then God produced
a perfect calm. Let us not then be unmindful of the greatness of these terrors, in order that
we may remember the magnitude of the benefits received from God. He who knows not
the nature of the disease will not understand the physician’s art. Let us tell these things also
to our children; and transmit them to the remotest generations, that all may learn how the
Devil had endeavoured to destroy the very foundation of the city; and how God was able
visibly to raise it up again, when it was fallen and prostrate; and did not permit even the
least injury to befall it, but took away the fear; and dispelled with much speed the peril it
had been placed in. For even through the past week we were all expecting that our substance
would be confiscated; and that soldiers would have been let loose upon us; and we were
dreaming of a thousand other horrors. But lo! all these things have passed away, even like
a cloud or a flitting shadow; and we have been punished only in the expectation of what is
dreadful; or rather we have not been punished, but we have been disciplined, and have become
better; God having softened the heart of the Emperor. Let us then always and every
day say, “Blessed be God!” and with greater zeal let us give heed to our assembling, and let
us hasten to the church, from whence we have reaped this benefit. For ye know whither ye
fled at the first; whither ye flocked together; and from what quarter our safety came. Let us
then hold fast by this sacred anchor; and as in the season of danger it did not betray us, so
now let us not leave it in the season of relief; but let us await with exact attention the stated
assemblies and prayers; and let us every day give a hearing to the divine oracles. And the
leisure which we spent in busily running about after those who came from the court,1500
whilst we were labouring under anxiety in respect to the evils that threatened us; this let us
consume wholly in hearing the divine laws, instead of unseasonable and senseless pastimes;
lest we should again reduce ourselves to the necessity of that sort of occupation.1501</p>
<p>4. On the three foregoing days, then, we have investigated one method of acquiring the
knowledge of God, and have brought it to a conclusion; explaining how “the heavens declare
the glory of God;”1502 and what the meaning of that is, which is said by Paul; viz. “That the
invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood

by the things that are made.”1503 And we shewed how from the creation of the world, and
how by heaven, and earth, the sea, the Creator is glorified. But to-day, after briefly philosophising
on that same subject, we will proceed to another topic. For He not only made
it,1504 but provided also that when it was made, it should carry on its operations; not permitting
it to be all immoveable, nor commanding it to be all in a state of motion. The
heaven, for instance, hath remained immoveable, according as the prophet says, “He placed
the heaven as a vault, and stretched it out as a tent over the earth.”1505 But, on the other
hand, the sun with the rest of the stars, runs on his course through every day.1506 And again,
the earth is fixed, but the waters are continually in motion; and not the waters only, but the
clouds, and the frequent and successive showers, which return at their proper season. The
nature of the clouds is one, but the things which are produced out of them are different. For
the rain, indeed, becomes wine in the grape, but oil in the olive. And in other plants is
changed into their juices; and the womb of the earth is one, and yet bears different fruits.
The heat, too, of the sun-beams is one, but it ripens all things differently; bringing some to
maturity more slowly, and others more quickly. Who then but must feel astonishment and
admiration at these things?</p>
<p>5. Nay, this is not the only wonder, that He hath formed it with this great variety and
diversity; but farther, that He hath spread it before all in common; the rich and the poor,
sinners as well as the righteous. Even as Christ also declared: “He maketh His sun to rise
upon the evil and the good, and sendeth His rain upon the just and unjust.”1507 Moreover,
when He stocked the world with various animals, and implanted divers dispositions in the
creatures, He commanded us to imitate some of these, and to avoid others. For example;
the ant is industrious, and performs a laborious task. By giving heed then, thou wilt receive
the strongest admonition from this animal not to indulge in sloth, nor to shun labour and
toil. Therefore also the Scripture has sent the sluggard to the ant, saying, “Go to the ant,
thou sluggard, emulate his ways, and be wiser than he.”1508 Art thou unwilling, he means,
to learn from the Scriptures, that it is good to labour, and that he who will not work, neither
ought he to eat?1509 learn it from the irrationals! This also we do in our families, when those

who are older, and who are considered superior, have done amiss, we bid them to attend
to thoughtful children. We say, “Mark such an one, who is less than you, how earnest and
watchful he is.” Do thou then likewise receive from this animal the best exhortation to industry;
and marvel at thy Lord, not only because He hath made heaven and the sun, but
because He hath also made the ant. For although the animal be small, it affords much proof
of the greatness of God’s wisdom. Consider then how prudent the ant is, and consider how
God hath implanted in so small a body, such an unceasing desire of working! But whilst
from this animal thou learnest industry; take from the bee at once a lesson of neatness, industry,
and social concord! For it is not more for herself1510 than for us, that the bee labours,
and toils every day; which is indeed a thing especially proper for a Christian; not to seek his
own things, but the things of others. As then she traverses all the meadows that she may
prepare a banquet for another, so also, O man, do thou likewise; and if thou hast accumulated
wealth, expend it upon others; if thou hast the faculty of teaching,1511 do not bury the talent,
but bring it out publicly for the sake of those who need it! Or if thou hast any other advantage,
become useful to those who require the benefit of thy labours! Seest thou not that for this
reason, especially, the bee is more honoured than the other animals; not because she labours,
but because she labours for others? For the spider also labours, and toils, and spreads out
his fine textures over the walls, surpassing the utmost skill of woman; but the creature is
without estimation, since his work is in no way profitable to us; such are they that labour
and toil, but for themselves! Imitate too the simplicity of the dove! Imitate the ass in his love
to his master, and the ox also! Imitate the birds in their freedom from anxiety! For great,
great indeed is the advantage that may be gained from irrational creatures for the correction
of manners.</p>
<p>6. From these animals Christ also instructs us, when He says, “Be ye wise as serpents,
and harmless as doves.”1512 And again; “Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither
do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them.”1513 The
prophet also, to shame the ungrateful Jews, thus speaks; “The ox knoweth his owner, and
the ass his master’s crib; but Israel doth not know me.”1514 And again; “The turtle and the
swallow and the crane observe the time of their coming, but my people knoweth not the
judgment of the Lord his God.”1515 From these animals, and such as these, learn to achieve

virtue, and be instructed to avoid wickedness by the contrary ones. For as the bee followeth
good, so the asp is destructive. Therefore shun wickedness, lest thou hear it said, “The
poison of asps is under their lips.”1516 Again, the dog is devoid of shame. Hate, therefore,
this kind of wickedness. The fox also is crafty, and fraudulent. Emulate not this vice; but as
the bee, in flying over the meadows, does not choose every sort of flower;1517 but selecting
that which is useful, leaves the rest; so also do thou; and whilst surveying the whole race of
irrational animals, if any thing profitable may be drawn from these, accept it; the advantages
which they have naturally, make it thy business to practise of thine own free choice. For in
this respect also thou hast been honoured of God; that what they have as natural advantages
He hath permitted thee to achieve of thy own free choice, in order that thou mayest also
receive a reward. For good works with them spring not from free will, and reason, but from
nature only. In other words, the bee makes honey, not because it has learnt this by reason
and reflection, but because it is instructed by nature. Because if the work had not been natural,
and allotted to the race, some of them assuredly would have been unskilled in their
art; whereas from the time that the world was first made, even to the present day, no one
hath observed bees resting from labour, and not making honey. For such natural characteristics
are common to the whole race. But those things which depend on our free choice are
not common; for labour is necessary that they may be accomplished.</p>
<p>7. Take then all the best things, and clothe thyself with them; for thou art indeed king
of the irrationals; but kings, if there be any thing excellent possessed by their subjects, be it
gold or silver, or precious stones, or sumptuous vestments, usually possess the same in
greater abundance. From the creation also, learn to admire thy Lord! And if any of the things
thou seest exceed thy comprehension, and thou art not able to find the reason thereof, yet
for this glorify the Creator, that the wisdom of these works surpasses thine understanding.
Say not, wherefore is this? or, to what end? for everything is useful, even if we know not the
reason of it. As therefore, if thou goest into a surgery, and seest many instruments lying
before thee, thou wonderest at the variety of the implements though ignorant of their use;
so also act with respect to the creation. Although thou seest many of the animals, and of the
herbs, and plants, and other things, of which thou knowest not the use, admire the variety
of these; and feel astonishment for this reason at the perfect workmanship of God; that He
hath neither made all things manifest to thee, nor permitted all things to be unknown. For
He hath not permitted all things to be unknown, lest thou shouldest say, that the things that
exist are not of providence. He hath not permitted all things to be known to thee, lest the
greatness of thy knowledge should excite thee to pride. Thus at least it was that the evil demon

<pb n="612"/>
precipitated1518 the first man headlong and by means of the hope of greater knowledge,
deprived him of that he already possessed. Therefore also, a certain wise man exhorts, saying,
“Seek not out the things that are too hard for thee; neither search the things that are too
deep for thee. But what is commanded thee, think thereupon with reverence; for the greater
part of His works are done in secret.”1519 And again; “More things are shewed unto thee
than men understand.” But this he speaks for the purpose of consoling the man who is sad
and vexed, because he does not know all things; for even those things he observes, which
thou art permitted to know, greatly surpass thine understanding; for thou couldest not have
found them by thyself, but thou hast been taught them of God. Wherefore be content with
the wealth given thee, and do not seek more; but for what thou hast received give thanks;
and do not be angry on account of those things which thou hast not received. And, for what
thou knowest, give glory, and do not stumble at those things of which thou art ignorant.
For God hath made both alike profitably; and hath revealed some things, but hidden others,
providing for thy safety.</p>
<p>8. One mode, then, of knowing God, is that by the creation, which I have spoken of,
and which might occupy many days. For in order that we might go over the formation of
man only with exactness, (and I speak of exactness such as is possible to us, not of real exactness;
since many as are the reasons we have already given for the works of creation, many
more of these there are, ineffable, which God who made them knoweth, for of course we
do not know them all); in order then, I say, that we might take an exact survey of the whole
modelling of man; and that we might discover the skill there is in every member; and examine
the distribution and situation of the sinews, the veins, and the arteries, and the moulding
of every other part; not even a whole year would suffice for such a disquisition.</p>
<p>9. For this reason, here dismissing this subject; and having given to the laborious and
studious an opportunity, by what has been said, of going over likewise the other parts of
Creation; we shall now direct our discourse to another point which is itself also demonstrative
of God’s providence. What then is this second point? It is, that when God formed man, he
implanted within him from the beginning a natural law. And what then was this natural
law? He gave utterance to conscience within us; and made the knowledge of good things,
and of those which are the contrary, to be self-taught. For we have no need to learn that
fornication is an evil thing, and that chastity is a good thing, but we know this from the first.

And that you may learn that we know this from the first, the Lawgiver,1520 when He afterwards
gave laws, and said, “Thou shalt not kill,”1521 did not add, “since murder is an evil
thing,” but simply said, “Thou shall not kill;” for He merely prohibited the sin, without
teaching. How was it then when He said, “Thou shalt not kill,” that He did not add, “because
murder is a wicked thing.” The reason was, that conscience had taught this beforehand; and
He speaks thus, as to those who know and understand the point. Wherefore when He speaks
to us of another commandment, not known to us by the dictate of consciences He not only
prohibits, but adds the reason. When, for instance, He gave commandment respecting the
Sabbath; “On the seventh day thou shalt do no work;” He subjoined also the reason for this
cessation. What was this? “Because on the seventh day God rested from all His works which
He had begun to make.”1522 And again; “Because thou wert a servant in the land of
Egypt.”1523 For what purpose then I ask did He add a reason respecting the Sabbath, but
did no such thing in regard to murder? Because this commandment was not one of the
leading ones. It was not one of those which were accurately defined of our conscience, but
a kind of partial and temporary one; and for this reason it was abolished afterwards.1524
But those which are necessary and uphold our life, are the following; “Thou shalt not kill;
Thou shalt not commit adultery; Thou shalt not steal.” On this account then He adds no
reason in this case, nor enters into any instruction on the matter, but is content with the
bare prohibition.</p>
<p>10. And not only from thence, but from another consideration also, I will endeavour
to shew you how man was self-taught with respect to the knowledge of virtue. Adam sinned
the first sin; and after the sin straightway hid himself; but if he had not known he had been
doing something wrong, why did he hide himself? For then there were neither letters, nor
law, nor Moses. Whence then doth he recognise the sin, and hide himself? Yet not only does

we have received to be understood, not to be still celebrated by rest of the body.” St. Chrys. on Gen. ii. 3, Hom.
X. (7), has, “Now already from the beginning God offered us instruction typically (αἰνιγματωδῶς), teaching us
to dedicate and separate the one day in the circle of the week wholly to employment in things spiritual;” thus
making the Sabbath a type of the Lord’s Day, and rest from secular, of rest in spiritual work.</note>

he so hide himself, but when called to account, he endeavours to lay the blame on another,
saying, “The woman, whom Thou gavest me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.” And
that woman again transfers the accusation to another, viz. the serpent. Observe also the
wisdom of God; for when Adam said, “I heard Thy voice, and I was afraid, for I was naked,
and I hid myself,”1525 God does not at once convict him of what he had done, nor say, “Why
hast thou eaten of the tree?” But how? “Who told thee,” He asks, “that thou wast naked,
unless thou hast eaten of that Tree of which alone I commanded thee not to eat?” He did
not keep silence, nor did He openly convict him. He did not keep silence, that He might
call him forth to the confession of his crime. He did not convict him openly, lest the whole
might come from Himself, and the man should so be deprived of that pardon which is
granted us from confession.1526 Therefore he did not declare openly the cause from whence
this knowledge sprung, but he carried on the discourse in the form of interrogation, leaving
the man himself to come to the confession.</p>
<p>11. Again, in the case of Cain and Abel, the same proceeding is observable. For, in the
first place, they set apart the fruits of their own labours to God. For we would shew not from
his sin only, but also from his virtue, that man was capable of knowing both these things.
Wherefore that man knew sin to be an evil thing, Adam manifested; and that he knew that
virtue was a good thing, Abel again made evident. For without having learnt it from any
one, without having heard any law promulgated respecting the first fruits, but having been
taught from within, and from his conscience, he presented that sacrifice. On this account I
do not carry the argument down to a later period; but I bring it to bear upon the time of
these earlier men, when there were as yet no letters, as yet no1527 law, nor as yet prophets
and judges; but Adam only existed with his children; in order that thou mayest learn, that
the knowledge of good and evil had been previously implanted in their natures. For from
whence did Abel learn that to offer sacrifice was a good thing;1528 that it was good to honour

now to judge what may have been likely to seem reasonable and natural to our first parents, who had a
stronger apprehension of natural things, as well as a more sensible communion with God, than we. It may be
observed, that such a view does not interfere with the strictly typical character of the sacrifice, because man is

God, and in all things to give thanks? “Why then?” replies some one, “did not Cain bring
his offering?” This man also did offer sacrifice, but not in like manner. And from thence
again the knowledge of conscience is apparent. For when, envying him who had been honoured,
he deliberated upon murder, he conceals his crafty determination. And what says
he; “Come, let us go forth into the field.”1529 The outward guise was one thing, the pretence
of love; the thought another, the purpose of fratricide. But if he had not known the design
to be a wicked one, why did he conceal it? And again, after the murder had been perpetrated,
being asked of God, “Where is Abel thy brother?” he answers, “I know not; Am I my
brother’s keeper?” Wherefore does he deny the crime? Is it not evidently because he exceedingly
condemns himself. For as his father had hid himself, so also this man denies his guilt,
and after his conviction, again says, “My crime is too great to obtain pardon.”1530</p>
<p>12. But it may be objected, that the Gentile allows nothing of this sort. Come then, let
us discuss this point, and as we have done with respect to the creation, having carried on
the warfare against these objectors not only by the help of the Scriptures, but of reason, so
also let us now do with respect to conscience. For Paul too, when he was engaged in controversy
with such persons, entered upon this head. What then is it that they urge? They say,
that there is no self-evident law seated in our consciences; and that God hath not implanted
this in our nature. But if so, whence is it, I ask, that legislators have written those laws which
are among them concerning marriages, concerning murders, concerning wills, concerning
trusts, concerning abstinence from encroachments on one another, and a thousand other
things. For the men now living may perchance have learned them from their elders;1531 and
<note type="footnote">enjoined, are typical, and represented as typical in Holy Scripture. And again, sacrifice, if it originated in God’s
gift of reason, was certainly sanctioned, and endowed with an atoning power, by His special laws. The prevailing
neglect of our Eucharistic oblation as such, and separating in thought our partaking of the sacrifice of our Lord
from the sacrament of the altar, tend to obscure men’s views on this subject. It is, however, difficult to conceive
how the sacrifice of animals should have occurred to man, without some divine indication beyond the permission
to use them for food. St. Chrys. on Gen. iv. Hom. XVIII. (5), speaks of nothing more than an offering “out of
our possessions” as taught by natural conscience; and of Abel’s offering being of the first-born, and of the best,
as a proof of his devotion. On this view the type would arise from the divine permission of animal food.</note>

they from those who were before them, and these again from those beyond? But from whom
did those learn who were the originators and first enactors of laws among them? Is it not
evident that it was from conscience? For they cannot say, that they held communication
with Moses; or that they heard the prophets. How could it be so when they were Gentiles?
But it is evident that from the very law which God placed in man when He formed him from
the beginning, laws were laid down, and arts discovered, and all other things. For the arts
too were thus established, their originators having come to the knowledge of them in a selftaught
manner.</p>
<p>13. So also came there to be courts of justice, and so were penalties defined, as Paul accordingly
observes. For since many of the Gentiles were ready to controvert this, and to say,
“How will God judge mankind who lived before Moses? He did not send a lawgiver; He did
not introduce a law; He commissioned no prophet, nor apostle, nor evangelist; how then
can He call these to account?” Since Paul therefore wished to prove that they possessed a
self taught law; and that they knew clearly what they ought to do; hear how he speaks; “For
when the Gentiles who have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these
having not the law, are a law unto themselves; which shew the work of the law written in
their hearts.”1532 But how without letters? “Their conscience also bearing witness, and their
thoughts the meanwhile accusing, or else excusing one another. In the day when God shall
judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.”1533 And again; “As many
as have sinned without law, shall perish without law; and as many as have sinned in the law,
shall be judged by the law.”1534 What means, “They shall perish without law?” The law not
accusing them, but their thoughts, and their conscience; for if they had not a law of conscience,
it were not necessary that they should perish through having done amiss. For how
should it be so if they sinned without a law? but when he says, “without a law,” he does not
assert that they had no law, but that they had no written law, though they had the law of
nature. And again; “But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the
Jew first, and also to the Gentile.”1535</p>
<p>14. But these things he spake in reference to the early times, before the coming of Christ;
and the Gentile he names here is not an idolater, but one who worshipped God only; unfettered
by the necessity of Judaical observances, (I mean Sabbaths, and circumcision, and

divers purifications,) yet exhibiting all manner of wisdom and piety.1536 And again, discoursing
of such a worshipper, he observes, “Wrath and indignation, tribulation and anguish,
upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile.”1537 Again
he here calls by the name of Greek one who was free from the observance of Judaic customs.
If, then, he had not heard the law, nor conversed with the Jews, how could there be wrath,
indignation and tribulation against him for working evil? The reason is, that he possessed
a conscience inwardly admonishing him, and teaching him, and instructing him in all things.
Whence is this manifest? From the way in which he1538 punished others when they did
amiss; from the way in which he laid down laws; from the way in which he set up the tribunals
of justice. With the view of making this more plain, Paul spoke of those who were living in
wickedness. “Who, knowing the ordinance of God, that they which commit such things are
worthy of death, not only do the same, but also consent with them that practise them.”1539
“But from whence,” says some one, “did they know, that it is the will of God, that those who
live in iniquity should be punished with death?” From whence? Why, from the way in which
they judged others who sinned. For if thou deemest not murder to be a wicked thing, when
thou hast gotten a murderer at thy bar, thou shouldest not punish him. So if thou deemest
it not an evil thing to commit adultery, when the adulterer has fallen into thy hands, release
him from punishment! But if thou recordest laws, and prescribest punishments, and art a
severe judge of the sins of others; what defence canst thou make, in matters wherein thou
thyself doest amiss, by saying that thou art ignorant what things ought to be done? For
suppose that thou and another person have alike been guilty of adultery. On what account
dost thou punish him, and deem thyself worthy of forgiveness? Since if thou didst not know
adultery to be wickedness, it were not right to punish it in another. But if thou punishest,
and thinkest to escape the punishment thyself, how is it agreeable to reason that the same
offences should not pay the same penalty?</p>
<p>15. This indeed is the very thing which Paul rebukes, when he says, “And thinkest thou
this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt
escape the judgment of God?”1540 It is not, it cannot be possible; for from the very sentence,
<note type="footnote">1536 The term ῞Ελλην, “Gentile,” or literally “Greek,” usually at that time meant idolater. Thus we find many
works of the Fathers “against the Greeks.” But on the passage referred to, Hom. V. on Rom., he expressly includes
Melchizedek and Job under the name as there used. These expressions, therefore, indicate what a man might
be, though a Gentile, not what Gentiles usually were. Observe also that his description applies only to those
spoken of in verse 10. But the being out of the Jewish Covenant applies also to the Gentiles in verses 8 and 9.</note>

he means, which thou pronouncest upon another, from this sentence God will then judge
thee. For surely thou art not just, and God unjust! But if thou overlookest not another suffering
wrong, how shall God overlook? And if thou correctest the sins of others, how will
not God correct thee? And though He may not bring the punishment upon thee instantly,
be not confident on that account, but fear the more. So also Paul bade thee, saying, “Despisest
thou the riches of His goodness, and forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the
goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?”1541 For therefore, saith he, doth he bear with
thee, not that thou mayest become worse, but that thou mayest repent. But if thou wilt not,
this longsuffering becomes a cause of thy greater punishment; continuing, as thou dost,
impenitent. This, however, is the very thing he means, when he says, “But after thy hardness
and impenitent heart treasurest up to thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation
of the righteous judgment of God. Who will render to every man according to his deeds.”1542
Since, therefore, He rendereth to every man according to his works; for this reason He both
implanted within us a natural law, and afterwards gave us a written one, in order that He
might demand an account of sins, and that He might crown those who act rightly. Let us
then order our conduct with the utmost care, and as those who have soon to encounter a
fearful tribunal; knowing that we shall enjoy no pardon, if after a natural as well as written
law, and so much teaching and continual admonition, we neglect our own salvation.</p>
<p>16. I desire then to address you again on the subject of oaths; but I feel ashamed. For to
me, indeed, it is not wearisome both by day and by night to repeat the same things to you.
But I am afraid, lest, having followed you up so many days, I should seem to condemn you
of great listlessness, that you should require continual admonition respecting so easy a
matter. And I am not only ashamed, but also in fear for you! for frequent instruction to
those who give heed, is salutary and profitable; but to those who are listless, it is injurious,
and exceedingly perilous; for the oftener any one hears, the greater punishment does he
draw upon himself, if he does not practise what is told him. With this accordingly God reproached
the Jews, speaking thus: “I have sent my prophets, rising up early, and sending
them; and even then ye did not hearken.”1543 We therefore do this of our great care for you.
But we fear, lest, on that tremendous Day, this admonition and counsel should rise up
against you all. For when the point to be attained is easy, and he whose office it is continually
to admonish, desists not from his task, what defence shall we have to offer? or what argument
will save us from punishment? Tell me, if a sum of money chance to be due to you, do you
not always, when you meet the debtor, remind him of the loan? Do thou too1544 act thus;

and let every one suppose that his neighbour owes him money, viz., the fulfilling of this
precept; and upon meeting him, let him put him in mind of the payment, knowing that no
small danger lies at our door, whilst we are unmindful of our brethren. For this cause I too
cease not to make mention of these things. For I fear, lest by any means I should hear it said
on that day, “O wicked and slothful servant, thou oughtest to have put my money to the
exchangers.”1545 Behold, however, I have laid it down,1546 not once, or twice, but oftentimes.
It is left then for you to discharge the usury of it. Now the usury of hearing is the manifestation
of it by deeds, for the deposit is the Lord’s. Therefore let us not negligently receive
that with which we are entrusted; but let us keep it with diligence, that we may restore it
with much interest on That Day. For unless thou bring others to the performance of the
same good works, thou shalt hear that voice, which he who buried the talent heard. But God
forbid it should be this! but may you hear that different voice which Christ uttered, saying
to him who had made profit, “Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful
over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.”1547</p>
<p>17. And this voice we shall hear, if we shew the same earnestness as he did. And we shall
shew this earnestness, if we do this which I say. When you depart, whilst what you have
heard is yet warm within you, exhort one another! And just as ye each salute at parting, so
let every one go from hence with an admonition, and say to his neighbour, “Observe and
remember that thou keep the commandment;” and thus shall we assuredly get the mastery.
For when friends also dismiss one with such counsel; and on one’s return home, one’s wife
again admonishes one to the same effect; and our word keeps its hold on you when alone;
we shall soon shake off this evil habit. I know, indeed, that ye marvel why I am so earnest
respecting this precept. But discharge the duty enjoined, and then I will tell you. Meanwhile,
this I say; that this precept is a divine law; and it is not safe to transgress it. But if I shall see
it rightly performed, I will speak of another reason,1548 which is not less than this, that ye
may learn that it is with justice I make so much ado about this law. But it is now time to
conclude this address in a prayer. Wherefore, let us all say in common, “O God, Who willest
not the death of a sinner, but that he should be converted and live; grant that we, having
discharged this and every other precept, may be found worthy so to stand at the tribunal of
Thy Christ, that having enjoyed great boldness, we may attain the kingdom to Thy glory.

<p>A further thanksgiving to God for the change in the late melancholy aspect of affairs. Reminiscence
of those who were dragged away, and punished because of the sedition. Exposition
on the subject of the creation of man, and of his having received a natural law. Of the
complete accomplishment of abstinence from oaths.</p>
<p>1. With the same introduction and prelude that I began yesterday and the day before,
I shall begin to-day. Now again I will say, “Blessed be God!” What a day did we see last
Wednesday!1549 and what in the present! On that day how heavy was the gloom! How bright
the calm of the present! That was the day when that fearful tribunal was set in the city, and
shook the hearts of all, and made the day to seem no better than night; not because the
beams of the sun were extinguished, but because that despondency and fear darkened your
eyes. Wherefore, that we may reap the more pleasure, I wish to relate a few of the circumstances
which then occurred; for I perceive that a narrative of these things will be serviceable
to you, and to all who shall come afterwards. Besides, to those who have been delivered from
shipwreck, it is sweet to remember the waves, and the tempest, and the winds, when they
are come into port. And to those who have fallen into sickness, it is an agreeable thing, when
the sickness is over, to talk over with others the fevers by which they were nearly brought
to the grave. When terrors have passed away, there is a pleasure in relating those terrors;
the soul no longer fearing them, but deriving therefrom more cheerfulness. The remembrance
of past evils always makes the present prosperity to appear more strikingly.</p>
<p>2. When the greater portion of the city had taken refuge from the fear and danger of
that occasion, in secret places, in deserts, and in hollows;1550 terror besetting them in all
directions; and the houses were empty of women, and the forum of men, and scarce two or
three appeared walking together across it, and even these going about as if they had been
animated corpses: at this period, I proceeded to the tribunal of justice, for the purpose of
seeing the end of these transactions; and there, beholding the fragments of the city collected
together, I marvelled most of all at this, that although a multitude was around the doors,
there was the profoundest silence, as though there had been no man there, all looking upon
one another; not one daring to enquire of his neighbour, nor to hear anything from him;
for each regarded his neighbour with suspicion; since many already, having been dragged
away, beyond all expectation, from the midst of the forum, were now confined within. Thus
we all alike looked up to heaven, and stretched out our hands in silence, expecting help from
above, and beseeching God to stand by those who were brought to judgment, to soften the
<note type="footnote">1549 τετρ€δα. Feriam quartam, the fourth day of the week. The day referred to was probably one of the days
of silence mentioned in the beginning of Hom. XI., where, first line of sec. 2, read “ourselves.”</note>
<note type="footnote">1550 φ€ραγγας, usually “ravines.” There were, however, caves near Antioch.</note>

<pb n="622"/>
hearts of the judges, and to make their sentence a merciful one. And just as when some
persons on land, beholding others suffering shipwreck, cannot indeed go near to them, and
reach out the hand, and relieve their distress, being kept back from them by the waves; yet
away on the shore, with outstretched hands and tears, they supplicate God that He may help
the drowning; so there in like manner, did all silently and mentally call upon God, pleading
for those at the tribunal, as for men surrounded by the waves, that He would stretch out
His hand, and not suffer the vessel to be overwhelmed, nor the judgment of those under
trial to end in an utter wreck. Such was the state of things in front of the doors; but when I
entered within the court, other sights I saw which were still more awful; soldiers armed with
swords and clubs, and strictly keeping the peace for the judges within. For since all the relatives
of those under trial, whether wives, or mothers, or daughters, or fathers, stood before
the doors of the seat of justice; in order that if any one happened to be led away to execution,
yet no one inflamed at the sight of the calamity might raise any tumult or disturbance; the
soldiers drove them all afar off; thus preoccupying their mind with fear.</p>
<p>3. One sight there was, more pitiable than all; a mother, and a sister of a certain person,
who was among those under trial within, sat at the very vestibule of the court of justice,
rolling themselves on the pavement, and becoming a common spectacle to all the bystanders;
veiling their faces, and shewing no sense of shame, but that which the urgency of the
calamity permitted. No maid servant, nor neighbour, nor female friend, nor any other relative
accompanied them. But hemmed in by a crowd of soldiers, alone, and meanly clad,
and grovelling on the ground, about the very doors, they were in more pitiable case than
those who were undergoing judgment within, and hearing as they did the voice of the executioners,
the strokes of the scourge, the wailing of those who were being scourged, the
fearful threats of the judges, they themselves endured, at every scourging, sharper pains
than those who were beaten. For since, in the confessions of others, there was a danger of
accusations being proved, if they heard any one scourged that he might mention those who
were guilty, and uttering cries, they, looking up to heaven, besought God to give the sufferer
some strength of endurance, lest the safety of their own relations should be betrayed by the
weakness of others, while incapable of sustaining the sharp anguish of the strokes. And
again, the same thing occurred as in the case of men who are struggling with a tempest. For
just as when they perceive the violence of a wave lifting up its head from afar, and gradually
increasing, and ready to overwhelm the vessel, they are almost dead with terror, before it
comes near the ship; so also was it with these. If at any time they heard voices, and cries that
reached them, they saw a thousand deaths before their eyes, being in terror, lest those who
were urged to bear witness, giving way to their torments, should name some one of those
who were their own relatives. And thus, one saw tortures both within and without. Those
within the executioners were tormenting; these women, the despotic force of nature, and
the sympathy of the affections. There was lamentation within, and without! inside, on the

<pb n="623"/>
part of those who were found guilty, and outside on the part of their relatives. Yea, rather
not these only, but their very judges inwardly lamented, and suffered more severely than
all the rest; being compelled to take part in so bitter a tragedy.</p>
<p>4. As for me, while I sat and beheld all this, how matrons and virgins, wont to live in
seclusion, were now made a common spectacle to all; and how those who were accustomed
to lie on a soft couch, had now the pavement for their bed; and how they who had enjoyed
so constant an attendance of female servants and eunuchs, and every sort of outward distinction,
were now bereft of all these things; and grovelling at the feet of every one, beseeching
him to lend help by any means in his power to those who were undergoing examination,
and that there might be a kind of general contribution of mercy from all; I exclaimed, in
those words of Solomon, “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.”1551 For I saw both this and another
oracle fulfilled in every deed, which saith, “All the glory of man is as the flower of
grass. The grass withereth, and the flower falleth away.”1552 For then indeed, wealth, and
nobility, and notoriety, and the patronage of friends, and kinship and all worldly things,
were found worthless; the sin, and transgression of the law which had taken place, having
put all these succours to flight. And just as the mother of young birds, when the nestlings
have been carried away, coming and finding her nest empty, is unable to rescue her captive
brood; but by hovering around the hands of the fowler, in this way displays her grief; even
so did these women then do, when their children were snatched away from their dwellings,
and shut up within, as it were in a net, or a trap. They could not indeed come in and deliver
the prisoners, but they manifested their anguish by wallowing on the ground near the very
doors; by lamentation and groans; and by endeavouring to approach as near as possible to
those who had captured them. These things then beholding, I cast in my mind That Dread
Tribunal; and I said within myself, “If now, when men are the judges, neither mother, nor
sister, nor father, nor any other person, though guiltless of the deeds which have been perpetrated,
can avail to rescue the criminals; who will stand by us when we are judged at the
dread Tribunal of Christ? Who will dare to raise his voice? Who will be able to rescue those
who shall be led away to those unbearable punishments. Notwithstanding they were the
first men of the city who were then brought to trial, and the very chief of the nobility, yet
they would have been glad if it could be granted them to lose all their possessions, yea, if
need were, their liberty itself, so that they might continue to enjoy this present life.</p>
<p>5. But to proceed. The day now hastening to its close, and late1553 evening arriving, and
the final sentence of the court being expected, all were in still greater agony, and besought
God that He would grant some delay and respite; and incline the soul of the judges to refer

the facts that had been investigated to the decision of the Emperor; since perchance some
advantage might arise from this reference.1554 Moreover, by the people general supplications1555
were sent up to the Merciful God; imploring that He would save the remnants of
the city; and not suffer it entirely to be razed from its foundations. Nor could one see any
one joining in this cry but with tears. Nevertheless, none of these things then moved the
judges within, although they heard. One thing only they considered, that there might be a
rigid enquiry into the deeds that had been perpetrated.</p>
<p>6. At last having loaded the culprits with chains, and bound them with iron, they sent
them away to the prison through the midst of the forum. Men that had kept their studs of
horses, who had been presidents of the games,1556 who could reckon up a thousand different
offices of distinction which they had held, had their goods confiscated, and seals might be
seen placed upon all their doors. Their wives also being ejected from their parents’ home,
each had literally to play the part of Job’s wife. For they went “wandering1557 from house
to house and from place to place, seeking a lodging.”1558 And this it was not easy for them
to find, every one fearing and trembling to receive, or to render assistance in any way to the
relatives of those who were under impeachment. Nevertheless, though such events had
happened, the sufferers were patient under all; since they were not deprived of the present
life. And neither the loss of wealth, nor dishonour, nor so much public exposure, nor any
other matter of that nature, caused them vexation. For the greatness of the calamity, and
the circumstance of their having expected still worse things, when they suffered these, had
prepared the soul for the exercise of a wise fortitude. And now they learnt, how simple a
thing is virtue for us, how easy and expeditious of performance, and that from our neglect
only it seems to be laborious. They who before this time could not bear the loss of a little
money with meekness, now they were subject to a greater fear, although they had lost all
their substance, felt as if they had found a treasure, because they had not lost their lives. So

that if the sense of a future hell took possession of us, and we thought of those intolerable
punishments, we should not grieve, even though for the sake of the law of God we were to
give both our substance, and our bodies and lives too, knowing that we should gain greater
things; deliverance from the terrors that are hereafter.</p>
<p>7. Perchance the tragedy of all I have told you, has greatly softened your hearts. Do not
however take it amiss. For since I am about to venture upon some more subtle thoughts
and require a more sensitive state of mind on your part, I have done this intentionally, in
order that by the terror of the description your minds might have shaken off all listlessness,
and withdrawn themselves from all worldly cares, and might with the more readiness convey
the force of the things about to be spoken into the depths of your soul.</p>
<p>Sufficiently indeed, then, our discourse of late1559 evinced to you, that a natural law of
good and evil is seated within us. But that our proof of it may be more abundantly evident,
we will again to-day apply ourselves strenuously to the same subject of discourse. For that
God from the beginning, when He formed man, made him capable of discriminating both
these, all men make evident. Hence when we sin, we are all ashamed at the presence of our
inferiors; and oftentimes a master, on his way to the house of a harlot, if he then perceives
any one of his more respectable servants, turns back, reddening with shame, from this untoward
path. Again, when others reproach us, fixing on us the names of particular vices, we
call it an insult; and if we are aggrieved, we drag those who have done the wrong to the
public tribunal. Thus we can understand what vice is and what virtue is. Wherefore Christ,
for the purpose of declaring this, and shewing that He was not introducing a strange law,
or one which surpassed our nature, but that which He had of old deposited beforehand in
our conscience, after pronouncing those numerous Beatitudes, thus speaks; “All things
whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.”1560 “Many words,”
saith He, “are not necessary, nor laws of great length, nor a diversity of instruction. Let thine
own will be the law. Dost thou wish to receive kindness? Be kind to another. Dost thou wish
to receive mercy? Show mercy to thy neighbour. Dost thou wish to be applauded? Applaud
another. Dost thou wish to be beloved? Exercise love. Dost thou wish to enjoy the first rank?
First concede that place to another. Become thyself the judge, thyself the lawgiver of thine
own life. And again; “Do not to another what thou hatest.”1561 By the latter precept, he
would induce to a departure from iniquity; by the former, to the exercise of virtue. “Do not
thou to another,” he saith,1562 “what thou hatest.” Dost thou hate to be insulted? Do not

<pb n="626"/>
insult another. Dost thou hate to be envied? Envy not another. Dost thou hate to be deceived?
Do not deceive another. And, in a word, in all things, if we hold fast these two precepts, we
shall not need any other instruction. For the knowledge of virtue He hath implanted in our
nature; but the practice of it and the correction He hath entrusted to our moral choice.1563</p>
<p>8. Perhaps what is thus said, is obscure; wherefore I will again endeavour to make it
more plain. In order to know that it is a good thing to exercise temperance, we need no
words, nor instruction; for we ourselves have the knowledge of it in our nature, and there
is no necessity for labour or fatigue in going about and enquiring whether temperance is
good and profitable; but we all acknowledge this with one consent, and no man is in doubt
as to this virtue. So also we account adultery to be an evil thing, and neither is there here
any need of trouble or learning, that the wickedness of this sin may be known; but we are
all self-taught in such judgments; and we applaud virtue, though we do not follow it; as, on
the other hand, we hate vice, though we practise it. And this hath been an exceeding good
work of God; that He hath made our conscience, and our power of choice already, and before
the action, claim kindred with virtue, and be at enmity with wickedness.</p>
<p>9. As I said then, the knowledge of each of these things resides within the conscience of
all men, and we require no teacher to instruct us in these things; but the regulation of our
conduct is left to our choice, and earnestness, and efforts. And why was this? but because
if He had made everything to be of nature, we should have departed uncrowned and destitute
of reward; and even as the brutes, who receive no reward nor praise for those advantages
which they have naturally, so neither should we enjoy any of these things; for natural advantages
are not the praise and commendation of those who have them, but of the Giver. For
this reason, then, He did not commit all to nature; and again, He did not suffer our will to
undertake the whole burden of knowledge, and of right regulation; lest it should despair at
the labour of virtue. But conscience suggests to it what ought to be done; and it contributes
its own exertions for the accomplishment. That it is a good thing to be temperate, we all
understand without difficulty; for the knowledge is of nature: but we should not be able
without difficulty, without bridling lust, and employing much exertion, to practise the rule
of temperance; for this does not come to us by nature as the knowledge does, but requires
also a willing mind and earnestness. And not only in this respect has He made the burden
lighter for us, but also in another way again, by letting even some good dispositions exist
naturally within us. For we are all naturally disposed to feel indignation along with those
who are contemptuously treated, (whence it arises that we become the enemies of those

who are insolent, though we ourselves may have suffered no part of the grievance,) and to
sympathize in the pleasure of those who enjoy assistance and protection; and we are overcome
by the calamities of others, as well as by mutual tenderness.1564 For although calamitous
events may seem to induce a certain pusillanimity,1565 we entertain nevertheless a common
fondness for each other. And to this effect a certain wise man speaks significantly; “Every
animal loveth his like, and man his neighbour.”1566</p>
<p>10. But God hath provided many other instructors for us besides conscience; viz., fathers
for children, masters for servants, husbands for wives, teachers for pupils, law-givers and
judges for those who are to be governed, and friends for friends. And frequently too we gain
no less from enemies than friends; for when the former reproach us with our offences, they
stir us up, even against our will, to the amendment of them. So many teachers hath He set
over us, in order that the discovery of what is profitable, and the regulation of our conduct,
might be easy to us, the multitude of those things which urge us on toward it not permitting
us to fall away from what is expedient for us. For although we should despise parents, yet
while we fear magistrates, we shall in any case be more submissive than otherwise. And
though we may set them at nought1567 when we sin, we can never escape the rebuke of
conscience: and if we dishonour and repel this, yet whilst fearing the opinion of the many,
we shall be the better for it. And though we are destitute of shame with regard to this, the
fear of the laws will press on us so as to restrain us, however reluctantly.</p>
<p>11. Thus fathers and teachers take the young in hand, and bring them into order;1568
and lawgivers and magistrates, those who are grown up. And servants, as being more inclined
to listlessness, in addition to what has been previously mentioned, have their masters to
constrain them to temperance; and wives have their husbands. And many are the walls
which environ our race on all sides, lest it should too easily slide away, and fall into
wickedness. Beside all these too; sicknesses and calamities instruct us. For poverty restrains,
and losses sober us, and danger subdues us, and there are many other things of this sort.

Doth neither father, nor teacher, nor prince, nor lawgiver, nor judge make thee fear? Doth
no friend move thee to shame, nor enemy sting thee? Doth no master chastise? Doth no
husband instruct? Doth no conscience correct thee? Still, when bodily sickness comes, it
often sets all right; and a loss has made the audacious man to become gentle. And what is
more than this, heavy misfortunes, which befal not only ourselves but others too, are often
of great advantage to us; and we who ourselves suffered nothing, yet beholding others enduring
punishment, have been no less sobered by it than they.</p>
<p>12. And with respect to right deeds, any one may see that this happens; for as when the
bad are punished others become better, so whenever the good achieve any thing right, many
are urged onward to a similar zeal: a thing which hath also taken place with respect to the
avoiding of oaths. For many persons, observing that others had laid aside the evil practice
of oaths, took a pattern from their diligence, and got the better of the sin; wherefore we are
the more disposed to touch again on the subject of this admonition. For let no one tell me
that “many” have accomplished this; this is not what is desired, but that “all” should do so;
and until I see this I cannot take breath.1569 That Shepherd had a hundred sheep, and yet
when one of them had wandered away, he took no account of the safety of the ninety and
nine, until he found the one that was lost, and restored it again to the flock.1570 Seest thou
not that this also happens with respect to the body; for if by striking against any obstacle,
we have only turned back a nail, the whole body sympathizes with the member. Say not this;
that only a certain few have failed; but consider this point, that these few being unreformed,
will corrupt many others. Although there was but one who had committed fornication
among the Corinthians, yet Paul so groaned as if the whole city were lost. And very reasonably,
for he knew that if that member were not chastened, the disease progressing onward
would at length attack all the rest. I saw, but lately, in the court of justice, those distinguished
men bound and conducted through the forum; and while some were wondering at this extraordinary
degradation, others said there was nothing to wonder at; for that, where there
is matter of treason,1571 rank must go for nothing. Is it not then much more true that rank
must be of no avail where is impiety?</p>
<p>13. Thinking therefore of these things, let us arouse ourselves; for if ye bring not your
own endeavours to the task, every thing on our part is to no purpose. And why so? Because
it is not with the office of teaching, as it is with other arts. For the silversmith, when he has
fabricated a vessel of any kind, and laid it aside, will find it on the morrow just as he left it.
And the worker in brass, and the stone-cutter, and every other artificer, will each again take
his own work in hand, whatever it is, just in the state he quitted it. But it is not so with us,

but altogether the reverse; for we have not lifeless vessels to forge, but reasonable souls.
Therefore we do not find you such as we leave you, but when we have taken you, and with
manifold labour moulded, reformed you and increased your ardour on your departing from
this place, the urgency of business, besetting you on every side, again perverts you, and
causes us increased difficulty. Therefore, I supplicate and beseech you to put your own hand
to the work; and when ye depart hence, to shew the same earnest regard for your own safety,
that I have here shewn for your amendment.</p>
<p>14. Oh! that it were possible that I could perform good works as your substitute, and
that you could receive the rewards of those works! Then I would not give you so much
trouble. But how can I do this? The thing is impossible; for to every man will He render according
to his own works. Wherefore as a mother, when she beholds her son in a fever,
while she witnesses his sufferings1572 from choking and inflammation, frequently bewails
him, and says to him, “O my son, would that I could sustain thy fever, and draw off its flame
upon myself!” so now I say, Oh! that by labouring as your substitute, I could do good works
for you all! But no, this is not to be done. But of his own doings must each man give the
account, and one cannot see one person suffer punishment in the room of another. For this
reason I am pained and mourn, that on That Day, when ye are called to judgment, I shall
not be able to assist you, since, to say the truth, no such confidence of speech with God belongs
to me. But even if I had much confidence, I am not holier than Moses, or more
righteous than Samuel; of whom it is said, that though they had attained to so great virtue,
they could not in any way avail to assist the Jews; inasmuch as that people had given them-
selves over to excessive negligence.1573 Since, then, from our own works we shall be punished
or saved; let us endeavour, I beseech you, in conjunction with all the other precepts, to fulfill
this one; that, finally departing this life with a favourable hope, we may obtain those good
things which are promised, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ,
through Whom and with Whom, to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be glory both now
and ever, world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XIV.</head>
<p>After the whole people had been freed from all distress, and had become assured of safety,
certain persons again disturbed the city by fabricating false reports, and were convicted.
Wherefore this Homily refers to that subject; and also to the admonition concerning oaths;
for which reason also, the history of Jonathan, and Saul, and that of Jephthah, is brought
forward; and it is shewn how many perjuries result from one oath.</p>
<p>1. Not a little did the devil yesterday disturb our city; but God also hath not a little
comforted us again; so that each one of us may seasonably take up that prophetic saying,
“In the multitude of the sorrows that I had in my heart, thy comforts have refreshed my
soul.”1574 And not only in consoling, but even in permitting us to be troubled, God hath
manifested His tender care towards us. For to-day I shall repeat what I have never ceased
to say, that not only our deliverance from evils, but also the permission of them arises from
the benevolence of God. For when He sees us falling away into listlessness, and starting off
from communion with Him, and making no account of spiritual things, He leaves us for a
while; that thus brought to soberness, we may return to Him the more earnestly. And what
marvel is it, if He does this towards us, listless as we are; since even Paul declares that with
regard to himself and his disciples, this was the cause of their trials? For inditing his second
Epistle to the Corinthians, he speaks thus: “We would not, brethren, have you ignorant of
our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength,
insomuch that we despaired even of life; but we had the sentence of death in ourselves.”1575
As though he would say, “Dangers so great hung over us, that we gave up ourselves for lost;
and no longer hoped that any favourable change would take place, but were altogether in
expectation of death.” For such is the sense of that clause, “We had the sentence of death in
ourselves.” But nevertheless, after such a state of desperation, God dispelled the tempest,
and removed the cloud, and snatched us from the very gates of death. And afterwards, for
the purpose of shewing that his being permitted to fall into this danger also was the result
of much tender care for him, he mentions the advantage which resulted from the temptations,
which was, that he might continually look to Him, and be neither high-minded, nor confident.
Therefore having said this, “We had the sentence of death in ourselves;”1576 he adds
also the reason; “That we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which quickeneth the
dead.” For it is in the nature of trials to arouse us when we are dozing, or falling down, and
to stir us up, and make us more religious. When, therefore, O beloved! thou seest a trial at
one time extinguished, and at another time kindled again, be not cast down! Do not despond,
<note type="footnote">1574 Ps. xciv. 19.</note>
<note type="footnote">1575 2 Cor. i. 8, 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">1576 2 Cor. i. 9.</note>

<pb n="631"/>
but retain a favourable hope, reasoning thus with thyself, that God does not deliver us into
the hands of our enemies either because He hates or abandons us, but because He is desirous
to make us more in earnest, and more intimate with Himself.</p>
<p>2. Let us not then be desponding; nor let us despair of a change for the better; but let us
hope that speedily there will be a calm; and, in short, casting the issue of all the tumults
which beset us upon God, let us again handle the customary points; and again bring forward
our usual topic of instruction. For I am desirous to discourse to you further concerning the
same subject, to the end that we may radically extirpate from your souls the wicked practice
of oaths. Wherefore it is necessary for me again to have recourse to the same entreaty that
I made before. For lately I besought you, that each one taking the head of John, just cut off,
and the warm blood yet dripping from it, you would thus go home, and think that you saw
it before your eyes, while it emitted a voice, and said, “Abhor my murderer, the oath!” What
a rebuke did not effect, this an oath effected; what a tyrant’s wrath was insufficient for, this
the necessity of keeping an oath brought about! And when the tyrant was publicly rebuked
in the hearing of all, he bore the censure nobly; but when he had thrown himself into the
fatal necessity caused by oaths, then he cut off that blessed head. This same thing, therefore,
I entreat; and cease not entreating, that wherever we go, we go bearing this head; and that
we shew it to all, crying aloud, as it does, and denouncing oaths. For although we were
never so listless and remiss, yet beholding the eyes of that head fearfully glaring upon us,
and threatening us if we swear, we should be more powerfully kept in check by this terror,
than by any curb; and be easily able to restrain and avert the tongue from its inclination
toward oaths.</p>
<p>3. There is not only this great evil in an oath, that it punishes those who are guilty of it,
both when violated, and when kept; a thing we do not see take place with any other sin; but
there is another equally great evil attending it. And what is that? Why that ofttimes it is utterly
impossible even for those who are desirous, and even make a point of it, to keep their oath.
For, in the first place, he who is continually swearing, whether willingly or unwillingly;
knowingly or unknowingly; in jest or in earnest; being frequently carried away by anger and
by many other things, will most surely become perjured. And no one can gainsay this; so
evident and generally allowed is the fact, that the man who swears frequently, must also be
a perjurer. Secondly, I affirm, that although he were not carried away by passion, and did
not become the victim of perjury1577 unwillingly and unwittingly, yet by the very nature of
the case he will assuredly be necessitated both consciously and voluntarily to perjure himself.
Thus, oftentimes when we are dining at home, and one of the servants happens to do amiss,
the wife swears that he shall be flogged, and then the husband swears the contrary, resisting,
and not permitting it. In this case, whatever they may do, perjury must in any case be the
<note type="footnote">1577 τοῦτο π€θῃ, al. ποιῇ, become guilty of.</note>

<pb n="632"/>
result; for however much they may wish and endeavour to keep their oaths, it is no longer
possible; but whatever happens, one or other of these will be ensnared in perjury; or rather
both in any case.</p>
<p>4. And how, I will explain; for this is the paradox. He who hath sworn that he would
flog the man-servant or maid-servant, yet hath afterwards been prohibited from this, hath
perjured himself, not having done what he hath sworn to do: and also, he hath involved in
the crime of perjury the party forbidding and hindering the oath from being kept. For not
only they who take a false oath, but they who impose that necessity on others, are liable to
the same accusation. And not merely in houses, but also in the forum we may see that this
takes place; and especially in fights, when those who box with one another swear things that
are contrary. One swears that he will beat, the other that he will not be beaten. One swears
that he will carry off the cloak, the other that he will not suffer this. One that he will exact
the money, the other that he will not pay it. And many other such contradictory things,
those who are contentious take an oath to do. So also in shops, and in schools, it may generally
be observed that the same thing occurs. Thus the workman hath often sworn that he will
not suffer his apprentice1578 to eat or drink, before he has finished all his assigned task. And
so also the pedagogue has often acted towards a youth; and a mistress towards her maidservant;
and when the evening hath overtaken them, and the work hath remained unfinished,
it is necessary either that those who have not executed their task should perish with hunger,
or that those who have sworn should altogether forswear themselves. For that malignant
demon, who is always lying in wait against our blessings, being present and hearing the
obligation of the oaths, impels those who are answerable to indifference; or works some
other difficulty; so that the task being unperformed, blows, insults, and perjuries, and a
thousand other evils, may take place. And just as when children drag with all their might a
long and rotten cord in directions opposite to each other; if the cord snaps in the middle,
they all fall flat upon their backs, and some strike their heads, and some another part of the
body; so also they who each engage with an oath to perform things that are contrary, when
the oath is broken by the necessity of the case, both parties fall into the same gulf of perjury:
these by actually perjuring themselves, and those by affording the occasion of perjury to the
others.</p>
<p>5. That this also may be rendered evident, not only from what happens every day in
private houses, and the places of public concourse, but from the Scriptures themselves, I
will relate to you a piece of ancient history, which bears upon what has been said. Once,
when the Jews had been invaded by their enemies, and Jonathan (now he was the son of
Saul) had slaughtered some, and put the rest to flight; Saul, his father, being desirous to
rouse the army more effectually against the remainder; and in order that they might not
<note type="footnote">1578 τῷ μαθητῇ.</note>

<pb n="633"/>
desist until he had subjugated them all, did that which was altogether opposite to what he
desired, by swearing that no one should eat any food until evening, and until vengeance was
taken of his enemies. What, I ask, could have been more senseless than this? For when it
was needful that he should have refreshed those who were fatigued and exhausted, and have
sent them forth with renewed vigour against their enemies, he treated them far worse than
he had done their enemies, by the constraint of an oath, which delivered them over to excessive
hunger. Dangerous, indeed, it is for any one to swear in a matter pertaining to himself;
for we are forcibly impelled to do many things by the urgency of circumstances. But much
more dangerous is it by the obligation of one’s own oath, to bind the determination of others;
and especially where any one swears, not concerning one, or two, or three, but an unlimited
multitude, which Saul then inconsiderately did, without thinking that it was probable that,
in so vast a number, one at least might transgress the oath; or that soldiers, and soldiers too
on campaign, are very far removed from moral wisdom, and know nothing of ruling the
belly; more especially when their fatigue is great. He, however, overlooking all these points,
as if he were merely taking an oath about a single servant, whom he was easily able to restrain,
counted equally on his whole army. In consequence of this he opened such a door for the
devil, that in a short time he framed, not two, three, or four, but many more perjuries out
of this oath. For as when we do not swear at all, we close the whole entrance against him,
so if we utter but a single oath, we afford him great liberty for constructing endless perjuries.
And just as those who twist skeins, if they have one to hold the end, work the whole string
with nicety, but if there is no one to do this, cannot even undertake the commencement of
it; in the same manner too the devil, when about to twist the skein of our sins, if he could
not get the beginning from our tongues, would not be able to undertake the work; but should
we only make a commencement, while we hold the oath on our tongue, as it were a hand,
then with full liberty he manifests his malignant art in the rest of the work, constructing
and weaving from a single oath a thousand perjuries.</p>
<p>6. And this was just what he did now in the case of Saul. Observe, however, what a snare
is immediately framed for this oath: “The army passed through a wood, that contained a
nest of bees, and the nest was in front of the people,1579 and the people came upon the nest,
and went along talking.”1580 Seest thou what a pit-fall was here? A table ready spread, that
the easiness of access, the sweetness of the food, and the hope of concealment, might entice
them to a transgression of the oath. For hunger at once, and fatigue, and the hour, (for “all
the land,” it is said, “was dining),”1581 then urged them to the transgression. Moreover, the
<note type="footnote">1579 Some mss. read του ‡γρου, of the ground, as LXX.</note>
<note type="footnote">1580 1 Sam. xiv. 26, LXX.</note>
<note type="footnote">1581 So LXX., 1 Kings xiv. 24 (i.e., 1 Samuel). The clause in the Hebrew, corresponding to the Greek words
καὶ π‚σα ἡ γῆ ἠρίστα, is 􀀀􀀀􀀀􀀀 􀀀􀀀􀀀-􀀀􀀀􀀀􀀀 􀀀􀀀􀀀, E.V. “And all they of the land came to a wood.” It seems most likely</note>

<pb n="634"/>
sight of the combs invited them from without to relax the strain on their resolution. For the
sweetness, as well as the present readiness of the table, and the difficulty of detecting the
stealth, were sufficient to ensnare their utmost wisdom. If it had been flesh, which needed
boiling or roasting, their minds would not have been so much bewitched; since while they
were delaying in the cookery of these, and engaged in preparing them for food, they might
expect to be discovered. But now there was nothing of this kind; there was honey only, for
which no such labour was required, and for which the dipping of the tip of the finger sufficed
to partake of the table, and that with secresy. Nevertheless, these persons restrained their
appetite, and did not say within themselves, “What does it concern us? Hath any one of us
sworn this? He may pay the penalty of his inconsiderate oath, for why did he swear?”
Nothing of this sort did they think; but religiously passed on; and though there were so
many enticements, they behaved themselves wisely. “The people went on talking.”1582 What
is the meaning of this word “talking?” Why, that for the purpose of soothing their pain with
words, they held discourse with one another.</p>
<p>7. What then, did nothing more come of this, when all the people had acted so wisely?
Was the oath, forsooth, observed? Not even so was it observed. On the contrary, it was violated!
How, and in what way? Ye shall hear forthwith, in order that ye may also thoroughly
discern the whole art of the devil. For Jonathan, not having heard his father take the oath,
“put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and his
eyes saw clearly.”1583 Observe, who it was whom he impelled to break the oath; not one of
the soldiers, but the very son of him who had sworn it. For he did not only desire to effect
perjury, but was also plotting the slaughter of a son, and making provision for it beforehand;
and was in haste to divide nature against her own self. and what he had done aforetime in
the case of Jephthah, that he hoped now again to accomplish. For he likewise, when he had
promised that the first thing that met him, after a victorious battle, he would sacrifice,1584
fell into the snare of child-murder; for his daughter first meeting him, he sacrificed her and
God did not forbid it. And I know, indeed, that many of the unbelievers impugn us of cruelty
and inhumanity on account of this sacrifice; but I should say, that the concession1585 in the
case of this sacrifice was a striking example of providence and clemency; and that it was in
<note type="footnote">that the word 􀀀􀀀􀀀 was thus taken, all the land went, i.e., “to dinner,” as the word 􀀀􀀀􀀀 stands in LXX. for the
name of the wood.</note>
<note type="footnote">1582 So LXX. Heb. 􀀀􀀀􀀀􀀀 􀀀􀀀􀀀 􀀀􀀀􀀀, E.V. And behold the honey dropped. This difference has arisen in all probability
from their mss. having read 􀀀􀀀􀀀 instead of 􀀀􀀀􀀀. This seems a probable conjecture: often, however, the
variations of the LXX. can be accounted for as being paraphrastic.</note>

<note type="footnote">1584 Jud. xi. 31.</note>
<note type="footnote">1585 He means the absence of interference, for it was against the law of Moses. Deut. xii. 31.</note>

<pb n="635"/>
care for our race that He did not prevent that sacrifice. For if after that vow and promise
He had forbidden the sacrifice, many also who were subsequent to Jephthah, in the expectation
that God would not receive their vows, would have increased the number of such
vows, and proceeding on their way would have fallen into child-murder. But now, by suffering
this vow to be actually fulfilled,1586 He put a stop to all such cases in future. And to shew
that this is true, after Jephthah’s daughter had been slain, in order that the calamity might
be always remembered, and that her fate might not be consigned to oblivion, it became a
law among the Jews, that the virgins assembling at the same season should bewail during
forty1587 days the sacrifice which had taken place; in order that renewing the memory of it
by lamentation, they should make all men wiser for the future; and that they might learn
that it was not after the mind of God that this should be done, for in that case He would not
have permitted the virgins to bewail and lament her. And that what I have said is not conjectural,
the event demonstrated; for after this sacrifice, no one vowed such a vow unto God.
Therefore also He did not indeed forbid this; but what He had expressly enjoined in the
case of Isaac, that He directly prohibited;1588 plainly shewing through both cases, that He
doth not delight in such sacrifices.</p>
<p>8. But the malignant demon was labouring hard now again to produce such a tragedy.
Therefore he impelled Jonathan to the trespass. For if any one of the soldiers had transgressed
the law, it seemed to him no great evil that would have been done; but now being insatiate
of human ills, and never able to get his fill of our calamities, he thought it would be no grand
exploit if he effected only a simple murder. And if he could not also pollute the king’s right
hand with the murder of his child, he considered that he had achieved no great matter. And
why do I speak of child-murder? For he, the wicked one, thought that by this means he
should compass a slaughter even more accursed than that. For if he had sinned wittingly,
and been sacrificed, this would only have been child-murder; but now sinning ignorantly,
(for he had not heard of the oath), if he had been slain, he would have made the anguish of
his father double; for he would have had both to sacrifice a son, and a son who had done
no wrong. But now to proceed with the rest of the history; “When he had eaten,” it is said,
“His eyes saw clearly.”1589 And here it condemns the king of great folly; shewing that hunger
had almost blinded the whole army, and diffused much darkness over their eyes. Afterwards
some one of the soldiers, perceiving the action, saith, “Thy father sware an oath upon all
the people, saying, cursed be the man who eateth any food to-day. And the people were

<pb n="636"/>
faint. And Jonathan said, My father hath made away1590 with the land.”1591 What does he
mean by the word, “made away with?” Why, that he had ruined, or destroyed them all.
Hence, when the oath was transgressed, all kept silence, and no one dared to bring forth the
criminal; and this became afterwards no small matter of blame, for not only are those who
break an oath, but those also who are privy to it and conceal it, partakers of the crime.</p>
<p>9. But let us see what follows; “And Saul said, Let us go down after the strangers,1592
and spoil them. And the priest said, Let us draw near hither unto God.”1593 For in old times
God led forth the people to battle; and without His consent no one dared to engage in the
fight, and war was with them a matter of religion. For not from weakness of body, but from
their sins they were conquered, whenever they were conquered; and not by might and
courage, but by favour from above they prevailed, whenever they did prevail. Victory and
defeat were also to them a means of training, and a school of virtue. And not to them only,
but to their adversaries; for this was made evident to them too, that the fate of battle with
the Jews was decided not by the nature of their arms, but by the life and good works of the
warriors. The Midianites at least perceiving this, and knowing that people to be invincible,
and that to have attacked them with arms and engines of war would have been fruitless, and
that it was only possible to conquer them by sin, having decked out handsome virgins, and
set them in the array,1594 excited the soldiers to lasciviousness, endeavouring by means of
fornication to deprive them of God’s assistance; which accordingly happened. For when
they had fallen into sin, they became an easy prey to all; and those whom weapons, and
horses, and soldiers, and so many engines availed not to capture,1595 sin by its nature delivered
over bound to their enemies. Shields, and spears, and darts were all alike found
useless; but beauty of visage and wantonness of soul overpowered these brave men.</p>
<p>10. Therefore one gives this admonition; “Observe not the beauty of a strange woman,
and meet not a woman addicted to fornication.1596 For honey distils from the lips of an
harlot, which at the time may seem smooth to thy throat, but afterward thou wilt find it
more bitter than gall, and sharper than a two-edged sword.”1597 For the harlot knows not

how to love, but only to ensnare; her kiss hath poison, and her mouth a pernicious drug.
And if this does not immediately appear, it is the more necessary to avoid her on that account,
because she veils that destruction, and keeps that death concealed, and suffers it not to become
manifest at the first. So that if any one pursues pleasure, and a life full of gladness, let
him avoid the society of fornicating women, for they fill the minds of their lovers with a
thousand conflicts and tumults, setting in motion against them continual strifes and contentions,
by means of their words, and all their actions. And just as it is with those who are the
most virulent enemies, so the object of their actions and schemes is to plunge their lovers
into shame and poverty, and the worst extremities. And in the same manner as hunters,
when they have spread out their nets, endeavour to drive thither the wild animals, in order
that they may put them to death, so also is it with these women. When they have spread out
on every side the wings1598 of lasciviousness by means of the eyes, and dress, and language,
they afterwards drive in their lovers, and bind them; nor do they give over until they have
drunk up their blood, insulting them at last, and mocking their folly, and pouring over them
a flood of ridicule. And indeed such a man is no longer worthy of compassion but deserves
to be derided and jeered, since he is found more irrational than a woman, and a harlot besides.
Therefore the Wise Man gives this word of exhortation again, “Drink waters from thine
own cistern, and from the fountain of thine own well.”1599 And again; “Let the hind of thy
friendship, and the foal of thy favours, consort with thee.”1600 These things he speaks of a
wife associated with her husband by the law of marriage. Why leavest thou her who is a
helpmate, to run to one who is a plotter against thee? Why dost thou turn away from her
who is the partner of thy living, and court her who would subvert thy life? The one is thy
member and body, the other is a sharp sword. Therefore, beloved, flee fornication; both for
its present evils, and for its future punishment.</p>
<p>11. Perchance we may seem to have fallen aside from the subject; but to say thus much,
is no departure from it. For we do not wish to read you histories merely for their own sake,
but that you may correct each of the passions which trouble you: therefore also we make
these frequent appeals,1601 preparing our discourse for you in all varieties of style; since it
is probable that in so large an assembly, there is a great variety of distempers; and our task
is to cure not one only, but many different wounds; and therefore it is necessary that the
medicine of instruction should be various. Let us however return thither from whence we
made this digression: “And the Priest said, Let us draw near unto God. And Saul asked

counsel of God. Shall I go down after the strangers? Wilt Thou deliver them into my hands?
But on that day the Lord answered him not.”1602 Observe the benignity and mildness of
God who loveth man. For He did not launch a thunderbolt, nor shake the earth; but what
friends do to friends, when treated contemptuously, this the Lord did towards the servant.
He only received him silently, speaking by His silence, and by it giving utterance to all His
wrath. This Saul understood, and said, as it is recorded, “Bring near hither all the tribes of
the people, and know and see in whom this sin hath been this day. For as the Lord liveth,
Who hath saved Israel, though the answer be against Jonathan my son, he shall surely
die.”1603 Seest thou his rashness? Perceiving that his first oath had been transgressed, he
does not even then learn self-control, but adds again a second. Consider also the malignity
of the devil. For since he was aware that frequently the son when discovered, and publicly
arraigned, is able by the very sight at once to make the father relent, and might soften the
king’s wrath, he anticipated his sentence by the obligation of a second oath; holding him by
a kind of double bond, and not permitting him to be the master of his own determination,
but forcing him on every side to that iniquitous murder. And even whilst the offender was
not yet produced, he hath passed judgment, and whilst ignorant of the criminal, he gave
sentence. The father became the executioner; and before the enquiry declared his verdict of
condemnation! What could be more irrational than this proceeding?</p>
<p>12. Saul then having made this declaration, the people were more afraid than before,
and all were in a state of great trembling and terror. But the devil rejoiced, at having rendered
them all thus anxious. There was no one, we are told, of all the people, who answered. “And
Saul said, Ye will be in bondage, and I, and Jonathan my son, will be in bondage.”1604 But
what he means is to this effect; “You are aiming at nothing else, than to deliver yourselves
to your enemies, and to become slaves instead of free men; whilst you provoke God against
you, in not delivering up the guilty person.” Observe also another contradiction produced
by the oath. It had been fitting, if he wished to find the author of this guilt, to have made
no such threat, nor to have bound himself to vengeance by an oath; that becoming less
afraid, they might more readily bring the offender to light.1605 But under the influence of
anger, and great madness, and his former unreasonableness, he again does that which is
directly contrary to what he desires. What need is there to enlarge? He commits the matter
to a decision by lot; and the lot falleth upon Saul, and Jonathan; “And Saul said, Cast ye the
lot between me and Jonathan; and they cast the lot, and Jonathan was taken. And Saul said

to Jonathan, Tell me, what hast thou done? And Jonathan told him, saying, I only tasted a
little honey on the top of the rod which is in my hand, and, lo! I must die.”1606 Who is there
that these words would not have moved and turned to pity? Consider what a tempest Saul
then sustained, his bowels being torn with anguish, and the most profound precipice appearing
on either hand! But nevertheless he did not learn self-control, for what does he say?
“God do so to me, and more also; for thou shalt surely die this day.”1607 Behold again the
third oath, and not simply the third, but one with a very narrow limit as to time; for he does
not merely say, “Thou shalt die;” but, “this day.”1608 For the devil was hurrying, hurrying
him on, constraining him and driving him to this impious murder. Wherefore he did not
suffer him to assign any future day for the sentence, lest there should be any correction of
the evil by delay. And the people said to Saul, “God do so to us, and more also, if he shall
be put to death, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel. As the Lord liveth, there
shall not an hair of his head fall to the ground; because he hath wrought a merciful thing
from God to-day.”1609 Behold how, in the second place, the people also swore, and swore
contrary to the king.</p>
<p>13. Now recollect, I pray, the cord pulled by the children, and breaking, and throwing
on their backs those who pull it. Saul swore not once or twice, but several times. The people
swore what was contrary, and strained in the opposite direction. Of necessity then it followed,
that the oath must in any wise be broken through. For it were impossible that all these should
keep their oaths. And now tell me not of the event of this transaction; but consider how
many evils were springing from it; and how the devil from thence was preparing the tragedy
and usurpation of Absalom. For if the king had chosen to resist, and to proceed to the exe-
cution of his oath, the people would have been in array against him; and a grievous rebellion1610
would have been set on foot. And again, if the son consulting his own safety had
chosen to throw himself into the hands of the army, he would straightway have become a
parricide. Seest thou not, that rebellion, as well as child-murder, and parricide, and battle,
and civil war, and slaughter, and blood, and dead bodies without number, are the consequences
of one oath. For if war had perchance broken out, Saul might have been slain,
and Jonathan perchance too, and many of the soldiers would have been cut to pieces; and
after all the keeping of the oath would not have been forwarded. So that it is not for thee to
consider that these events did not occur, but to mark this point, that it was the nature of the
case to necessitate the occurrence of such things. However, the people prevailed. Come then,

<pb n="640"/>
let us reckon up the perjuries that were the consequence. The oath of Saul was first broken
by his son; and again a second and a third, concerning the slaying of his son, by Saul himself.
And the people seemed to have kept their oath. Yet if any one closely examines the matter,
they too all became liable to the charge of perjury. For they compelled the father of Jonathan
to perjure himself, by not surrendering the son to the father. Seest thou how many persons
one oath made obnoxious to perjury,1611 willingly and unwillingly; how many evils it
wrought, how many deaths it caused?</p>
<p>14. Now in the commencement of this discourse I promised to shew that perjury would
in any case result from opposite oaths; but truly the course of the history has proved more
than I was establishing. It has exhibited not one, two, or three individuals, but a whole
people, and not one, two, or three oaths, but many more transgressed. I might also make
mention of another instance, and shew from that, how one oath caused a still greater and
more grievous calamity. For one oath1612 entailed upon all the Jews the capture of their
cities, as well as of their wives and children; the ravages of fire, the invasion of barbarians,
the pollution of sacred things, and ten thousand other evils yet more distressing. But I perceive
that the discourse is running to a great length. Therefore, dismissing here the narration
of this history, I beseech you, together with the beheading of John, to tell one another also
of the murder of Jonathan, and the general destruction of a whole people (which did not
indeed take place, but which was involved in the obligation of the oaths); and both at home,
and in public, and with your wives, and friends, and with neighbours, and with all men in
general, to make an earnest business of this matter, and not to think it a sufficient apology
that we can plead custom.</p>
<p>15. For that this excuse is a mere pretext, and that the fault arises not from custom but
from listlessness, I will endeavour to convince you from what has already occurred. The
Emperor has shut up the baths of the city, and has given orders that no one shall bathe; and
no one has dared to transgress the law, nor to find fault with what has taken place, nor to
allege custom. But even though in weak health perchance, men and women, and children
and old men; and many women but recently eased from the pangs of childbirth; though all
requiring this as a necessary medicine; bear with the injunction, willingly or unwillingly;
and neither plead infirmity of body, nor the tyranny of custom, nor that they are punished,
whereas others were the offenders, nor any other thing of this kind, but contentedly put up
with this punishment, because they were in expectation of greater evils; and pray daily that
the wrath of the Emperor may go no further. Seest thou that where there is fear, the bond
<note type="footnote">1611 It seems that all actually remained under this guilt. The only remedy would have been in Jonathan’s
confessing as soon as he knew his trespass, and an offering being made for him, according to Lev. v. 4–6, see
also Lev. v. 1, iv. 22, and xxxvii. 2.</note>
<note type="footnote">1612 See Hom. XIX.</note>

<pb n="641"/>
of custom is easily relaxed, although it be of exceedingly long standing, and great necessity?
To be denied the use of the bath is certainly a grievous matter. For although we be never so
philosophic, the nature of the body proves incapable of deriving any benefit for its own
health, from the philosophy of the soul. But as to abstinence from swearing, this is exceedingly
easy, and brings no injury at all; none to the body, none to the mind; but, on the contrary,
great gain, much safety, and abundant wealth. How then is it any thing but absurd, to submit
to the greatest hardships, when an Emperor enjoins it; but when God commands nothing
grievous nor difficult, but what is very tolerable and easy, to despise or to deride it, and to
advance custom as an excuse? Let us not, I entreat, so far despise our own safety, but let us
fear God as we fear man. I know that ye shudder at hearing this, but what deserves to be
shuddered at is that ye do not pay even so much respect to God; and that whilst ye diligently
observe the Emperor’s decrees, ye trample under foot those which are divine, and which
have come down from heaven; and consider diligence concerning these a secondary object.
For what apology will there be left for us, and what pardon, if after so much admonition we
persist in the same practices. For I began this admonition at the very commencement of the
calamity which has taken hold of the city, and that is now on the point of coming to an end;
but we have not as yet thoroughly put in practice even one precept. How then can we ask a
removal of the evils which still beset us, when we have not been able to perform a single
precept? How can we expect a change for the better? How shall we pray? With what tongue
shall we call upon God? For if we perform the law, we shall enjoy much pleasure, when the
Emperor is reconciled to the city. But if we remain in the transgression, shame and reproach
will be ours on every hand, inasmuch as when God hath freed us from the danger we have
continued in the same listlessness.</p>
<p>16. Oh! that it were possible for me to undress the souls of those who swear frequently,
and to expose to view the wounds and the bruises which they receive daily from oaths! We
should then need neither admonition nor counsel; for the sight of these wounds would avail
more powerfully than all that could be said, to withdraw from their wickedness even those
who are most addicted to this wicked practice. Nevertheless, if it be not possible to spread
before the eyes the shameful state of their soul, it may be possible to expose it to the thoughts,
and to display it in its rottenness and corruption. For as it saith, “As a servant that is continually
beaten will not be clear of a bruise, so he that sweareth and nameth God continually
will not be purified of his sin.”1613 It is impossible, utterly impossible, that the mouth which
is practised in swearing, should not frequently commit perjury. Therefore, I beseech you
all, by laying aside this dreadful and wicked habit, to win another crown. And since it is
every where sung of our city, that first of all the cities of the world, she bound on her brow1614

the name of Christians, so let all have to say, that Antioch alone, of all the cities throughout
the world, hath expelled all oaths from her own borders. Yea, rather, should this be done,
she will not be herself crowned alone, but will also carry others along with her to the same
pitch of zeal. And as the name of Christians having had its origin here, hath as it were from
a kind of fountain overflown all the world, even so this good work, having taken its root
and starting-point from hence, will make all men that inhabit the earth your disciples; so
that a double and treble reward may arise to you, at once on account of your own good
works, and of the instruction afforded to others. This will be to you the brightest of diadems!
This will make your city a mother city, not on earth, but in the heavens! This will stand by
us at That Day, and bring us the crown of righteousness; which God grant that we may all
obtain, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the
Father, together with the Holy Spirit, be glory, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Again on the calamity of the city of Antioch. That fear is every way profitable. That sorrow
is more useful than laughter. And upon the saying, “Remember that thou walkest in the
midst of snares.”1615 And that it is worse to exact an oath, than to commit murder.</p>
<p>1. To-day, and on the former Sabbath,1616 it had behoved us to enter on the subject of
fasting; nor let any one suppose that what I said was unseasonable.1617 For on the days of
the fast, counsel and admonition on that subject are indeed not at all necessary; the very
presence of these days exciting even those who are the most remiss to the effort of fasting.
But since many men, both when about to enter upon the fast, as if the belly were on the
point of being delivered over to a sort of lengthened seige, lay in beforehand a stock of
gluttony and drunkenness; and again, on being set at liberty, going forth as from a long
famine and a grievous prison, run to the table with unseemly greediness, just as if they were
striving to undo again the advantage gained through the fast, by an excess of gluttony; it
might have been needful, that then as well as now, we should agitate the subject of temperance.
Nevertheless, we have neither lately said any thing of that kind, neither shall we now
speak upon it. For the fear of the impending calamity suffices, instead of the strongest admonition
and counsel, to sober the soul of every one. For who is there so miserable and
degraded, as to be drunken in such a tempest? Who is there so insensible, when the city is
thus agitated, and such a shipwreck is threatened, as not to become abstemious and watchful,
and more thoroughly reformed by this distress than by any other sort of admonition and
counsel? For discourse will not be able to effect as much as fear does. And this very thing it
is now possible to shew from the events which have taken place. How many words then did
we spend before this in exhorting many that were listless, and counselling them to abstain
from the theatres, and the impurities of these places! And still they did not abstain; but always
on this day they flocked together to the unlawful spectacles of the dancers; and they held
their diabolical assembly in opposition1618 to the full congregation of God’s Church; so that
their vehement shouts, borne in the air from that place, resounded against the psalms which
we were singing here. But behold, now whilst we were keeping silence, and saying nothing
on the subject, they of themselves have shut up their orchestra; and the Hippodrome has

<note type="footnote">1618 Or, “right opposite.” ‡ντικαθίστασαν. The word may be taken to imply that those spectacles were held
in the immediate neighbourhood of the church. Stage plays, and players, and all who took part in the public
games, were excluded from communion. The act, considered little short of idolatry, with which it was connected,
was denounced in several Councils. See Bingham, b. xvi. c. 4, sec. 10.</note>

<pb n="644"/>
been left deserted! Before this, many of our own people used to hasten to them; but now
they are all fled hither from thence to the church, and all alike join in praising our God!</p>
<p>2. Seest thou what advantage is come of fear? If fear were not a good thing, fathers would
not have set tutors1619 over their children; nor lawgivers magistrates for cities. What can
be more grievous than hell? Yet nothing is more profitable than the fear of it; for the fear
of hell will bring us the crown of the kingdom. Where fear is, there is no envy; where fear
is, the love of money does not disturb; where fear is, wrath is quenched, evil concupiscence
is repressed, and every unreasonable passion is exterminated. And even as in a house, where
there is always a soldier under arms, no robber, nor house-breaker, nor any such evil doer
will dare to make his appearance; so also while fear holds possession of our minds, none of
the base passions will readily attack us, but all fly off and are banished, being driven away
in every direction by the despotic power of fear. And not only this advantage do we gain
from fear, but also another which is far greater. For not only, indeed, does it expel our evil
passions, but it also introduces every kind of virtue with great facility. Where fear exists,
there is zeal in alms-giving, and intensity of prayer, and tears warm and frequent, and groans
fraught with compunction. For nothing so swallows up sin, and makes virtue to increase
and flourish, as a perpetual state of dread. Therefore it is impossible for him who does not
live in fear to act aright; as, on the other hand, it is impossible that the man who lives in fear
can go wrong.</p>
<p>3. Let us not then grieve, beloved, let us not despond on account of the present tribulation,
but let us admire the well-devised plan of God’s wisdom. For by these very means
through which the devil hoped to overturn our city, hath God restored and corrected it.
The devil animated certain lawless men to treat the very statues of the Emperor contemptuously,
in order that the very foundations of the city might be razed. But God employed this
same circumstance for our greater correction; driving out all sloth by the dread of the expected
wrath: and the thing has turned out directly opposite to what the devil wished, by the
means which he had himself prepared. For our city is being purified every day; and the lanes
and crossings, and places of public concourse, are freed from lascivious and voluptuous
songs; and turn where we will there are supplications, and thanksgivings, and tears, instead
of rude laughter; there are words of sound wisdom instead of obscene language, and our
whole city has become a Church, the workshops being closed, and all being engaged
throughout the day in these general prayers; and calling upon God in one united voice with
much earnestness. What preaching, what admonition, what counsel, what length of time
had ever availed to accomplish these things?</p>
<note type="footnote">1619 παιδαγωγοὺς. See Hom. vi. 1, p. 114, where the “teachers” are different from these. The paidagogos had
the moral supervision of the child; part of his duty was to conduct him daily to school. See Galatians iii. 24, revised
version.</note>

<pb n="645"/>
<p>4. For this then let us be thankful, and let us not be petulant or discontented; for that
fear is a good thing, what we have said hath made manifest. But hear Solomon thus uttering
a lesson of wisdom concerning it; Solomon, who was nourished in every luxury, and enjoyed
much security. What then does he say? “It is better to go to the house of mourning than to
the house of laughter.”1620 What sayest thou, I ask? Is it better to go where there is weeping,
lamentation, and groans, and anguish, and so much sadness, than where there is the dance,
the cymbals, and laughter, and luxury, and full eating and drinking? Yes, verily, he replies.
And tell me why is it so, and for what reason? Because, at the former place, insolence is bred,
at the latter, sobriety. And when a person goes to the banquet of one more opulent, he will
no longer behold his own house with the same pleasure, but he comes back to his wife in a
discontented mood; and in discontent he partakes of his own table; and is peevish towards
his own servants, and his own children, and every body in his house; perceiving his own
poverty the more forcibly by the wealth of others. And this is not the only evil; but that he
also often envies him who hath invited him to the feast, and returns home having received
no benefit at all. But with regard to the house of mourning, nothing of this sort can be said.
On the contrary, much spiritual wisdom is to be gained there, as well as sobriety. For when
once a person hath passed the threshold of a house which contains a corpse, and hath seen
the departed one lying speechless, and the wife tearing her hair, mangling her cheeks, and
wounding her arms, he is subdued; his countenance becomes sad; and every one of those
who sit down together can say to his neighbour but this, “We are nothing, and our wickedness
is inexpressible!”1621 What can be more full of wisdom than these words, when we both
acknowledge the insignificance of our nature, and accuse our own wickedness, and account
present things as nothing? Giving utterance, though in different words, to that very sentiment
of Solomon—that sentiment which is so marvellous and pregnant with Divine wisdom—“Vanity
of vanities, all is vanity.”1622 He who enters the house of mourning, weeps forthwith for
the departed, even though he be an enemy. Seest thou how much better that house is than
the other? for there, though he be a friend, he envies; but here, though he be an enemy, he
weeps. This is a thing which God requires of us above all, that we should not insult over
those who have occasioned us grief. And not only may we gather these advantages, but
others also which are not less than these. For each one is also put in mind of his own sins,
and of the fearful Tribunal; of the great Account, and of the Judgment; and although he may
have been suffering a thousand evils from others, and have a cause for sadness at home, he
will receive and take back with him the medicine for all these things. For reflecting that he
<note type="footnote">1620 Eccles. vii. 3. This may be a proverbial misquotation; St. Chrysostom afterwards adopts the LXX., house
of drinking; but his remarks are equally suitable to the E.V. feasting. Laughter is mentioned in verse 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">1621 This seems to be a proverbial saying, from the next sentence.</note>
<note type="footnote">1622 Eccles. i. 2.</note>

<pb n="646"/>
himself, and all those who swell with pride, will in a little while suffer the same thing; and
that all present things, whether pleasant or painful, are transitory; he thus returns to his
house, disburdened of all sadness and envy, with a light and buoyant heart; and hence he
will hereafter be more meek, and gentle, and benignant to all; as well as more wise; the fear
of things to come having made its way into his soul, and consumed all the thorns.</p>
<p>6. All this Solomon perceived when he said, “It is better to go to the house of mourning
than to the house of drinking.”1623 From the one grows listlessness, from the other an
earnest anxiety. From the one, contempt; from the other, fear; a fear which conducts us to
the practice of every virtue. If fear were not a good thing, Christ would not have expended
such long and frequent discourses on the subject of punishment, and vengeance to come.
Fear is nothing less than a wall, and a defence, and an impregnable tower. For indeed we
stand in need of much defence, seeing that there are many ambushments on every side.
Even as this same Solomon again says admonishingly, “Perceive that thou goest in the midst
of snares, and that thou walkest on the battlements of cities.”1624 Oh with how many good
things is this saying pregnant! Yea, not less than the former! Let us then, write it, each of
us, upon our minds, and carry it about ever in our memories, and we shall not easily commit
sin. Let us write it there, having first learnt it with the utmost exactness. For he does not
say, “Observe”1625 that thou goest in the midst of snares; but, “Perceive!” And for what
reason did he say, “Discern?”1626 He tells us that the snare is concealed; for this is indeed a
snare, when the destruction does not appear openly, and the injury is not manifest, which
lies hidden on all sides. Therefore he says, “Perceive!” Thou needest much reflection and
diligent scrutiny. For even as boys conceal traps with earth, so the devil covers up our sins
with the pleasures of this life.</p>
<p>7. But “perceive;” scrutinizing diligently; and if any kind of gain falls in thy way, look
not only at the gain, but inspect it carefully, lest somewhere death and sin lurk within the
gain; and shouldest thou perceive this, fly from it. Again, when some delight or pleasure
may chance to present itself, look not only at the pleasure; but lest somewhere in the depth
of the pleasure some iniquity should lie enveloped, search closely, and if thou discoverest
it, hasten away! And should any one counsel, or flatter, or cajole, or promise honours, or
any other such thing whatever, let us make the closest investigation; and look at the matter
on all sides, lest something pernicious, something perilous, should perchance befall us
through this advice, or honour, or attention, and we run upon it hastily and unwittingly.
For if there were only one or two snares, the precaution would be easy. But now, hear how
<note type="footnote">1623 Eccles. vii. 3.</note>
<note type="footnote">1624 Ecclus. ix. 13.</note>
<note type="footnote">1625 βλ™πε, “see,” as anything obvious.</note>
<note type="footnote">1626 ™πίγνωθι, “perceive,” implies taking pains to discover.</note>

<pb n="647"/>
Solomon speaks when he wishes to set forth the multitude of these; “Perceive that thou goest
in the midst of snares;” he does not say, that thou “goest by” snares, but “in the midst” of
snares. On either side are the pit-falls; on either side the deceits. One goes into the forum;
one sees an enemy; one is inflamed by the bare sight of him! one sees a friend honoured;
one is envious! One sees a poor man; one despises and takes no notice of him! One sees a
rich man; one envies him! One sees some one injuriously treated; one recoils in disgust!
One sees some one acting injuriously; one is indignant! One sees a handsome woman, and
is caught! Seest thou, beloved, how many snares there are? Therefore it is said, “Remember
that thou goest in the midst of snares.” There are snares in the house, snares at the table,
and snares in social intercourse. Very often a person unwittingly, in the confidence of
friendship, gives utterance to some particular of those matters which ought not to be repeated
again, and so great a peril is brought about, that the whole family is thereby ruined!</p>
<p>8. On every side then let us search closely into these matters. Often has a wife, often
have children, often have friends, often have neighbours, proved a snare to the unheeding!
And why, it is asked, are there so many snares? That we may not fly low, but seek the things
that are above. For just as birds, as long as they cleave the upper air, are not easily caught;
so also thou, as long as thou lookest to things above, wilt not be easily captured, whether by
a snare, or by any other device. The devil is a fowler. Soar, then, too high for his arrows.1627
The man who hath mounted aloft will no longer admire any thing in the affairs of this life.
But as when we have ascended to the top of the mountains, the city and its walls seem to us
to be but small, and the men appear to us to be going along upon the earth like ants; so when
thou hast ascended to the heights of spiritual wisdom, nothing upon the earth will be able
to fascinate thee; but every thing, yea even riches, and glory, and honour, and whatever else
there be of that kind, will appear insignificant when thou regardest heavenly things. According
to Paul all the glories of the present life appeared trifling, and more unprofitable than
dead things. Hence his exclamation, “The world is crucified unto me.”1628 Hence also his
admonition, “Set your affections on things above.”1629 Above? What kinds of things do you
speak of pray? Where the sun is, where the moon is? Nay, saith he. But where then? Where
angels are? where archangels? where the cherubim? where the seraphim are? Nay, saith he.
But where then? “Where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God.”</p>
<p>9. Let us obey then, and let us think of this continually, that even as to the bird caught
in the snare, wings are of no service, but he beats them about vainly, and to no purpose; so
also to thee there is no utility in thy reasonings,1630 when once thou art powerfully captivated

by wicked lust, but struggle as much as thou mayest, thou art captured! For this reason
wings are given to birds; that they may avoid snares. For this reason men have the power
of thinking; that they may avoid sin. What pardon then, or what excuse will be ours, when
we become more senseless than the brutes? For the bird which has once been captured by
the snare, yet afterwards escaped, and the deer which has fallen into the net, but has broken
through it, are hard to be captured again with the like; since experience becomes a teacher
of caution to every one. But we, though often snared in the same nets, fall into the same
again; and though honoured with reason, we do not imitate the forethought and care of the
irrational animals! Hence how often do we, from beholding a woman, suffer a thousand
evils; returning home, and entertaining an inordinate desire, and experiencing anguish for
many days; yet, nevertheless, we are not made discreet; but when we have scarcely cured
one wound, we again fall into the same mischief, and are caught by the same means; and
for the sake of the brief pleasure of a glance, we sustain a kind of lengthened and continual
torment. But if we learn constantly to repeat to ourselves this saying,1631 we shall be kept
from all these grievous evils.</p>
<p>10. The beauty of woman is the greatest snare. Or rather, not the beauty of woman, but
unchastened gazing! For we should not accuse the objects, but ourselves, and our own
carelessness. Nor should we say, Let there be no women, but Let there be no adulteries. We
should not say, Let there be no beauty, but Let there be no fornication. We should not say,
Let there be no belly, but let there be no gluttony; for the belly makes not the gluttony, but
our negligence. We should not say, that it is because of eating and drinking that all these
evils exist; for it is not because of this, but because of our carelessness and insatiableness.
Thus the devil neither ate nor drank, and yet he fell! Paul ate and drank, and ascended up
to heaven! How many do I hear say, Let there be no poverty! Therefore let us stop the mouths
of those who murmur at such things. For it is blasphemy to utter such complaints. To such
then, let us say, Let there be no meanness of spirit. For poverty brings innumerable good
things into our state of life, and without poverty riches would be unprofitable. Hence we
should accuse neither the one nor the other of these; for poverty and riches are both alike
weapons which will tend to virtue, if we are willing. As then the courageous soldier, whichever
weapon he takes, displays his own virtue, so the unmanly and cowardly one is encumbered
by either. And that thou mayest learn that this is true, remember, I pray, the case of Job;
who became both rich, and likewise poor, and handled both these weapons alike, and
conquered in both. When he was rich, he said, “My door was open to every comer.”1632 But
when he had become poor, “The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away. As it seemed
good unto the Lord, so hath it come to pass.”1633 When he was rich, he shewed much hos-

<note type="footnote">1633 Job i. 21. This last clause is added in LXX. and Vulg.</note>

<pb n="649"/>
pitality; when he was poor, much patience. And thou, then,—art thou rich? Display much
bountifulness! Hast thou become poor? Shew much endurance and patience! For neither
is wealth an evil, nor poverty in itself; but these things, either of them, become so according
to the free choice of those who make use of them. Let us school ourselves then to entertain
no such opinions on these subjects; nor let us accuse the works of God, but the wicked choice
of men. Riches are not able to profit the little-minded: nor is poverty able ever to injure the
magnanimous.</p>
<p>11. Let us then discern the snares, and walk far off from them! Let us discern the precipices,
and not even approach them! This will be the foundation of our greatest safety not only
to avoid things sinful, but those things which seem indeed to be indifferent, and yet are apt
to make us stumble towards sin. For example; to laugh, to speak jocosely, does not seem an
acknowledged sin, but it leads to acknowledged sin. Thus laughter often gives birth to foul
discourse, and foul discourse to actions still more foul. Often from words and laughter
proceed railing and insult; and from railing and insult, blows and wounds; and from blows
and wounds, slaughter and murder. If, then, thou wouldest take good counsel for thyself,
avoid not merely foul words, and foul deeds, or blows, and wounds, and murders, but unseasonable
laughter, itself, and the very language of banter; since these things have proved
the root of subsequent evils. Therefore Paul saith, “Let no foolish talking nor jesting proceed
out of thy mouth.”1634 For although this seems to be a small thing in itself, it becomes,
however, the cause of much mischief to us. Again, to live in luxury does not seem to be a
manifest and admitted crime; but then it brings forth in us great evils,—drunkenness, violence,
extortion, and rapine. For the prodigal and sumptuous liver, bestowing extravagant
service upon the belly, is often compelled to steal, and to seize the property of others, and
to use extortion and violence. If, then, thou avoidest luxurious living, thou removest the
foundation of extortion, and rapine, and drunkenness, and a thousand other evils; cutting
away the root of iniquity from its extremity. Hence Paul saith, that “she who liveth in
pleasure is dead while she liveth.”1635 Again, to go to the theatres, or to survey the horserace,
or to play at dice, does not seem, to most men, to be an admitted crime; but it introduces
into our life an infinite host of miseries. For spending time in the theatres produces fornication,
intemperance, and every kind of impurity. The spectacle of the horse-race also brings
about fightings, railings, blows, insults, and lasting enmities. And a passion for dice-playing
hath often caused blasphemies, injuries, anger, reproaches, and a thousand other things
more fearful still.</p>
<p>12. Therefore, let us not only avoid sins, but those things too which seem to be indifferent,
yet by degrees lead us into these misdeeds. He, indeed, who walks by the side of a precipice,
<note type="footnote">1634 A quotation made up of two passages, in Ephes. iv. 29, and Ephes. v. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">1635 1 Tim. v. 6.</note>

<pb n="650"/>
even though he may not fall over, trembles; and very often he is overset by this same trembling,
and falls to the bottom. So also he who does not avoid sins from afar, but walks near
them, will live in fear, and will often fall into them. Besides, he who eagerly looks at strange
beauties, although he may not commit adultery, hath in so doing entertained lust; and hath
become already an adulterer according to the declaration of Christ;1636 and often by this
very lust he is carried on to the actual sin. Let us then withdraw ourselves far from sins. Dost
thou wish to live soberly? Avoid not only adultery, but also the licentious glance! Dost thou
wish to be far removed from foul words? Avoid not only foul words, but also inordinate
laughter, and every kind of lust. Dost thou wish to keep far from committing murders?
Avoid railing too. Dost thou wish to keep aloof from drunkenness? Avoid luxury and
sumptuous tables, and pluck up the vice by the roots.</p>
<p>13. The licentiousness of the tongue is a great snare, and needs a strong bridle. Therefore
also some one saith. “His own lips are a powerful snare to a man, and he is snared by the
words of his own mouth.”1637 Above all the other members, then, let us control this; let us
bridle it; and let us expel from the mouth railings, and contumelies, and foul and slanderous
language, and the evil habit of oaths. For again our discourse hath brought us to the same
exhortation. But I had arranged with your charity, yesterday, that I would say no more
concerning this precept, forasmuch as enough has been said upon it on all the foregoing
days. But what is to become of me? I cannot bear to desist from this counsel, until I see that
ye have put it in practice; since Paul also, when he saith to the Galatians, “Henceforth let
no man trouble me,”1638 appears again to have met and addressed them.1639 Such are the
paternal bowels; although they say they will depart, yet they depart not, until they see that
their sons are chastened. Have ye heard to-day what the prophet speaks to us concerning
oaths; “I lifted up mine eyes, and I saw,” saith he, “and, behold, a flying sickle, the length
thereof twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits; and he said to me, What seest
thou? and I said, I see a flying sickle, twenty cubits in length, and ten cubits in breadth. It
shall also enter into the house,” saith he, “of every one that sweareth in my name, and shall
remain1640 in the midst, and shall pull down the stones and the wood.”1641 What, forsooth,

<pb n="651"/>
is this which is here spoken? and for what reason is it in the form of a “sickle,” and that a
“flying sickle,” that vengeance is seen to pursue the swearers? In order that thou mayest see
that the judgment is inevitable, and the punishment not to be eluded. For from a flying
sword some one might perchance be able to escape, but from a sickle, falling upon the neck,
and acting in the place of a cord,1642 no one can escape. And when wings too are added,
what further hope is there of safety? But on what account doth it pull down the stones and
the wood of the swearer’s house? In order that the ruin may be a correction to all. For since
it is necessary that the earth must hide the swearer when dead; the very sight of his ruined
house, now become a heap, will be an admonition to all who pass by and observe it, not to
venture on the like, lest they suffer the like; and it will be a lasting witness against the sin of
the departed. The sword is not so piercing as the nature of an oath! The sabre is not so destructive
as the stroke of an oath! The swearer, although he seems to live, is already dead,
and hath received the fatal blow. And as the man who hath received the halter,1643 before
he hath gone out of the city and come to the pit,1644 and seen the executioner standing over
him, is dead from the time he passed the doors of the hall of justice: so also the swearer.</p>
<p>14. All this let us consider, and let us not put our brethren on oath. What dost thou, O
man? At the sacred table thou exactest an oath, and where Christ lies slain, there thou slayest
thine own brother. Robbers, indeed, murder on the highways; but thou slayest the son in
the presence of the mother: committing a murder more accursed than Cain himself; for he
slew his brother in solitude and only with present death; but thou slayest thy brother in the
midst of the church, and that with the deathless death that is to come! For think you that
the church was made for this purpose, that we might swear? Yea, for this it was made, that
we might pray! Is the Table placed there, that we may make adjurations? It is placed there
to this end, that we may loose sins, not that we may bind them. But thou, if thou heedest
nothing else, reverence at least that book, which thou reachest forth in putting the oath; and
open the Gospel, which thou takest in hand when thou biddest swear; and when thou hearest
what Christ there declares concerning oaths, shudder and desist! What then does He there
say concerning oaths? “But I say unto you, Swear not at all.”1645 And dost thou convert the
Law1646 which forbids swearing into an oath. Oh, what contempt! Oh, what outrage! For
thou doest just the same thing as if any one should bid the lawgiver, who prohibits murder,
become himself a party to the murder. Not so much do I lament and weep, when I hear that

<pb n="652"/>
some persons are slain1647 upon the highway, as I groan, and shed tears, and am horrified,
when I see any one coming near this Table, placing his hands upon it, and touching the
Gospels, and swearing! Art thou in doubt, I ask, concerning money, and wouldest thou slay
a soul? What gainest thou to match the injury thou doest to thine own soul, and to thy
neighbour? If thou believest that the man is true, do not impose the obligation of the oath;
but if thou knowest him to be a liar, do not force him to commit perjury. “But that I may
have a full assurance:” saith one. Verily, when thou hast not sworn him, then thou wilt receive
a good and full assurance.1648</p>
<p>15. For now, when thou hast returned home, thou wilt be continually the prey of conscience,
whilst reasoning thus with thyself; “Was it to no purpose, then, that I put him upon
his oath? Was he not really perjured? Have I not become the cause of the sin?” But if thou
dost not put him upon his oath, thou wilt receive much consolation on returning home,
rendering thanks to God, and saying, “Blessed be God, that I restrained myself, and did not
compel him to swear vainly, and to no purpose. Away with gold! Perish the money!” for
that which specially gives us assurance is, that we did not transgress the law, nor compel
another to do it. Consider, for Whose sake thou didst not put any one on his oath; and this
will suffice thee for refreshment and consolation. Often, indeed, when a fight takes place,
we bear being insulted with fortitude, and we say to the insulter, “What shall I do with thee?
Such an one hinders me, who is thy patron; he keeps back my hands.” And this is sufficient
to console us. So when thou art about to put any one on his oath, restrain thyself; and stop;
and say to him who is about to swear, “What shall I do with thee? God hath forbidden me
to put any one on oath. He now holds me back.” This suffices both for the honour of the
Lawgiver, and for thy safety, and for keeping him in fear who is ready to swear. For when
he seeth that we are thus afraid to put others on oath, much more will he himself be afraid
to swear rashly. Wouldest thou say thus, thy return to thine own home would be with much
fulness of assurance. Hear God, therefore, in His Commandments, that He may Himself
hear thee in thy prayers! This word shall be written in heaven, and shall stand by thee on
the Day of Judgment, and shall discharge many sins.</p>
<p>16. This also let us consider not only with respect to an oath, but to every thing. And
when we are about to do any good action for God’s sake, and it is found to bring loss with
it, let us look not merely at the loss connected with the matter, but at the gain which we
shall reap by doing it for God. That is to say, Hath any one insulted thee? Bear it nobly! And
thou wilt do so, if thou thinkest not of the insult merely, but of the dignity of Him who

commands thee to bear it, and thou bearest it meekly. Hast thou given an alms? Think not
of the outlay, but of the produce which arises from the outlay. Hast thou been mulcted of
money? Give thanks, and regard not only the pain which is the result of the loss, but the
gain which comes of thanksgiving. If we thus regulate ourselves, none of those heavy events
which may befal us will give us pain; but from those things which may seem to be grievous,
we shall be even gainers, and loss will be sweeter and more desired than wealth, pain than
pleasure, and mirth and insult than honour. Thus all things adverse will turn to our gain.
And here we shall enjoy much tranquillity, and there we shall attain the kingdom of heaven;
which God grant that we may all be deemed worthy to obtain,1649 by the grace and lovingkindness
of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom and with Whom, to the Father with the
Holy Spirit, be glory, dominion, and honour, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>
<note type="footnote">1649 Of remission of sins in the Holy Eucharist, see Theodorus in Cat. on 1 Cor. xii. 31. “He that practiseth
the greatest and strongly forbidden sins, ought to abstain from the mysteries; for to such an one it is not good
to partake of them, until he first abstain from his sins, through fear of the laws laid down. But of other things,
such as must befall men….if we fall into such, it is not well to deprive ourselves of the mysteries, but to come
in the greater fear….inasmuch as remission also comes to us from thence, when we abstain from what is in our
power, and are found not neglectful of the rest; beside spiritual aid for the easier amendment of life. For all
things that are added to us by the death of Christ, the same it is just should be accomplished by the symbols of
His death.” Ed. Cramer, p. 222. This is implied in our own service, in the prayer after communicating, and in
the final answers of the catechism. So too in the Roman Canon of the Mass, “Deliver me, by this Thy Holy Body
and Blood, from all my iniquities and all evils.” Lit. of St. Basil, after the Gospel.…“We pray and beseech Thy

<head>Homily XVI.</head>
<p>This Homily was delivered on the occasion of the Prefect1650 entering the Church, for the
purpose of pacifying the minds of the people, in consequence of a rumour of an intended
sack1651 having been announced to him, when all were meditating flight. It treats also on
the subject of avoiding oaths, and on the words of the Apostle, “Paul, a prisoner of Jesus
Christ.”1652</p>
<p>1. I commend the Prefect’s consideration, that seeing the city agitated, and every one
purposing a flight, he hath come here and afforded you consolation, and hath led you to
entertain favourable hopes. But for you I blushed, and was ashamed, that after these long
and frequent discourses ye should have needed consolation from without.1653 I longed that
the earth would open and swallow me up, when I heard him discoursing with you, alternately
administering comfort, or blaming such ill-timed1654 and senseless cowardice. For it was
not becoming, that you should be instructed by him; but you ought yourselves to be teachers
to all the unbelievers.1655 Paul did not permit even going to law before the unbelievers;1656
but thou, after so much admonition of our Fathers,1657 hast needed teachers from without;
and certain vagabonds and miscreants have again unsettled this great city, and set it upon
flight. With what eyes shall we hereafter look upon the unbelievers, we who were so timid
and cowardly? With what tongue shall we speak to them, and persuade them to exercise
courage as to approaching evils, when we became through this alarm more timid than any
hare? “But what could we do,” says some one, “we are but men!” This is indeed the very
reason why we ought not to be terrified, because we are men, and not brutes. For these are
scared by all manner of sounds and noises; because they have not reasoning power, which
is adequate to dispel fear. But thou who hast been honoured with the gift of speech and
reason, how is it that thou sinkest to their ignoble condition? Hath some one entered the

city, and announced the march of soldiers against it? Be not terrified, but leaving him, bend
the knee: call upon thy Lord: groan bitterly, and He will keep off the dreaded event.</p>
<p>2. Thou hadst heard indeed a false report of the march, and wert in danger of being
severed from the present life.1658 But that blessed Job, when the messengers came one after
another, and he had heard them announcing their dreadful news, and adding thereto the
insupportable destruction of his children, neither cried nor groaned, but turned to prayer,
and gave thanks to the Lord. Him do thou too imitate; and when any comer announces that
soldiers have encircled the city, and are about to plunder its wealth, flee to thy Lord and say,
“The Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; as it seemeth good to the Lord, so is it done.
Blessed be the name of the Lord for ever.” The experience of the actual events did not terrify
him; yet the mere report frightens thee. And how are we to be accounted of, who when we
are commanded1659 boldly to encounter death itself, are thus affrighted by a false rumour!
The man who is bewildered constructs fear which is unreal; and trouble which is not visible;
but he who abides in a settled and tranquil condition of soul, breaks in pieces even that
which is real. Seest thou not pilots; when the sea is raging, and the clouds are rushing together,
and the thunders are bursting forth, and all on board are in confusion, they seat themselves
at the helm without tumult or disturbance; giving earnest heed to their own art, and considering
how they may ward off the effects of the approaching storm. Be these thy example;
and laying hold of the sacred anchor, the hope that is in God, remain unshaken and immoveable.
“Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto
a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand; and the rain descended, and the floods
came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of
it.”1660 Seest thou that it is the character of folly to fall down headlong, and to be overthrown?
Or rather, we were not only reduced to the condition of that foolish man, but our fall was
still more wretched. For the house of that man fell down after the rivers and rains had descended,
and the winds had beaten upon it; but we, when there were no winds striking, nor
floods invading, nor blasts assaulting, before the experience of disaster, were overturned by
a mere rumour, and dropped at once all the philosophy we were meditating.</p>
<p>3. What think ye are now my thoughts? How should I conceal,—yea, bury myself? How
must I blush with shame? If I had not been forcibly urged by our Fathers, I would not have
arisen, I would not have spoken, whilst my mind was darkened with sadness because of
your pusillanimity. But neither now have I been able to recover myself; since anger and
sorrow have laid such seige to my soul. For who would not feel provoked and indignant,
that after so much teaching ye should need the instructions of Gentiles, that ye might be

comforted and persuaded to bear in a manly way the present alarm. Pray ye therefore that
free utterance may be given us in opening our mouth; and that we may be able to shake off
this sadness, and to hold up again a little; for indeed this shame on account of your pusillanimity
hath greatly depressed our spirits.</p>
<p>4. Lately, I addressed to your Charity many things concerning the snares lying on all
sides of us; and concerning fear and sadness, sorrow and pleasure; and also concerning the
sickle that flieth down upon the houses of swearers. Now, out of all these many matters, I
would have you especially to remember what I said respecting the “winged sickle,” and its
settling in the swearer’s house; and pulling down the stones and the wood, and consuming
the whole mass. And withal, take heed to this; that it is the extreme of folly to swear by taking
the Gospels, and to turn the very Law which forbids swearing into an oath; and that it is
better to suffer loss of property than to impose an oath on our neighbours; since this is a
great honour to be done to God. For when thou sayest to God, “For thy sake I have not put
such a one, who hath robbed and injured me, on his oath,” God will pay thee back a great
recompense on account of this honour, both here and hereafter. Say these things to others,
and observe them also yourselves. I know that in this place we become more reverent, and
lay aside every evil habit. But what is to be aimed at is, not that we be lovers of wisdom here
only, but that when we depart, we may take this reverence out with us, where we especially
need it. For those who carry water do not merely have their vessels full when near the
fountain, and empty them when they reach home, but there they put them away with especial
caution, that they may not be overturned, and their labours rendered useless. Let us all imitate
these persons; and when we come home, let us strictly retain what has been spoken;
since if ye here have gotten full, but return home empty, having the vessels of your understandings
destitute of what ye have heard, there will be no advantage from your replenishment
here. Shew me not the wrestler in the place of exercise, but of actual contest; and religion
not at the season of hearing, but at the season of practice.</p>
<p>5. Thou applaudest what is said now. When thou art required to swear, then remember
all these things. If ye quickly accomplish this law, we will advance our teaching to other and
greater things. Lo! this is the second year that I am discoursing to your Charity; and I have
not yet been able to explain a hundred lines1661 of the Scriptures. And the reason is, that ye
need to learn of us what ye might reduce to practice at home, and of yourselves; and thus
the greater part of our exhortation is consumed on ethical discourse. But this ought not to
<note type="footnote">1661 στίχοι. Lines, or sentences. The ancients had two kind of verses, one of which they called στίχοι, and the
other ¿Ðματα. The stichoi were lines that contained a certain number of letters, and were not limited by the
sense as our modern verses. The Codex Bezæ and Alex. are so divided into parts, shorter than verses.</note>

<pb n="657"/>
have been so; the regulation of manners you ought to have learnt at home, and of yourselves;
but the sense of the Scriptures, and the speculations upon them, you might commit to us.
If, however, it were necessary that you should hear such things of us, there was no need of
more than one day: for what there is to be said is of no diversified or difficult character, or
such as requires any elaboration. For when God declares His sentence, subtle arguments
are unseasonable. God hath said, “Thou shalt not swear.” Do not then demand of me the
reasons of this. It is a royal law. He who established it, knows the reason of the law. If it had
not been profitable, He would not have forbidden it. Kings bring in laws, and not all perchance
profitable; for they are men, and cannot be competent to discover what is useful,
like God. Nevertheless, we obey them. Whether we marry, or make wills, or are about to
purchase servants, or houses, or fields, or to do any other act, we do these things not according
to our own mind, but according to the laws which they ordain; and we are not entirely
at liberty to dispose of the things which concern ourselves according to our own minds; but
in many cases we are subject to their will; and should we do any thing that is contrary to
their judgment, it becomes invalid and useless. So then tell me, are we to pay so much respect
to the laws of men, and trample under foot the law of God? What defence, or what pardon
can such conduct be worthy of? He hath said, “Thou shalt not swear.” In order that thou
mayest do and speak all things with safety, do not in practice lay down a law contrary to
His.</p>
<p>6. But enough of these matters. Let us now proceed to lay before you one sentence of
those which have been read to-day, and thus end this discourse. “Paul, a prisoner of Jesus
Christ,” saith he, “and Timothy the brother.”1662 Great is the designation of Paul: no title
of principality and power, but he speaks of bonds and chains! Truly great indeed! Although
many other things made him illustrious; his being caught up into the third heaven, his being
transported to Paradise, his hearing unutterable words; yet he sets down none of these, but
mentions the chain instead of all, for this made him more conspicuous and illustrious than
these. And why so? Because the one were the free gifts of the Lord’s lovingkindness; and the
other the marks of the constancy and patience of the servant. But it is customary with those
who love, to glory more in the things which they suffer for those who are beloved, than in
the benefits they receive from them. A king is not so proud of his diadem, as Paul gloried
in his chains. And very justly. For a diadem affords but an ornament to the crowned head;
but the chain is a much greater ornament as well as a security. The kingly crown often betrays
the head it encircles, and allures innumerable traitors, and invites them to the lust of empire.
And in battles this ornament is so dangerous, that it must be hidden and laid aside. Hence
kings in battle, change the outward dress, and so mingle in the crowd of combatants; so
much betrayal does there result from the crown; but the chain will bring nothing of this
<note type="footnote">1662 Philem. i.</note>

<pb n="658"/>
kind upon those who have it, but altogether the contrary; since if there be a war, and an
engagement with demons, and the hostile powers; the man who is thus encompassed, by
holding forth his chain, repels their assaults. And many of the secular magistrates not only
bear the name of office while they are in authority, but when they have given up their authority.
Such a one is called an ex-consul, such a one an ex-prætor. But he, instead of all
such titles, says, “Paul the prisoner.” And very rightly. For those magisterial offices are no
complete evidences of virtue in respect to the soul; for they are to be purchased by money,
and obtained by the solicitations of friends; but this distinction that is obtained by bonds is
a proof of the soul’s love of wisdom, and the strongest sign of a longing for Christ. And the
former are soon gone, but this distinction has none to succeed to it. Behold at least from
that time to the present day how long a time has passed, and yet the name of this Prisoner
has become increasingly illustrious. As to all the consuls, whoever they were, of former
times, they are passed into silence; and not even their names are known to the generality of
mankind. But the name of this Prisoner, the blessed Paul, is still great here, great in the land
of the barbarians, great also among the Scythians and Indians; and were you to go even to
the very bounds of the habitable world, you would hear of this appellation, and whithersoever
any one could come, he would perceive that the name of Paul was borne in the mouths of
all men. And what marvel is it, if it be so by land and sea, when even in the heavens the
name of Paul is great; with angels and archangels and the powers above, and with the King
of these, even God! “But what were the chains,” says some one, “that brought glory to him
who was thus fettered? Were they not formed of iron?” Of iron, indeed, they were formed;
but they contained the grace of the Spirit, abundantly flourishing in them; since he wore
them for Christ’s sake. Oh, wonder! the servants were bound, the Master was crucified, and
yet the preaching of the Gospel every day increases! And through the means by which it
was supposed that it would be extinguished, by these very means it was kindled; and the
Cross and bonds, which were thought to be an abomination, these are now become the
symbols of salvation; and that iron was to us more precious than all gold, not by its intrinsic
nature, but for this cause and ground!</p>
<p>7. But here I see an enquiry arising out of this point; and if you give me your attention,
I will both state the question exactly, and will add the solution. What then is the subject of
enquiry? This same Paul once having come before Festus, whilst discoursing to him, and
defending himself concerning the charges which the Jews had alleged against him, and
telling how he had seen Jesus, how he had heard that blessed voice; how he had been struck
with blindness and recovered sight, and had fallen down and risen up again; how he had
come a captive into Damascus, bound without chains; after speaking likewise of the Law
and of the Prophets, and shewing that they had foretold all these things, he captured the
judge, and almost persuaded him to come over to himself. For such are the souls of holy
men: when they have fallen into dangers, they do not consider how they may be delivered

<pb n="659"/>
from dangers, but strive every way how they may capture their persecutors. Just so did it
then happen. He came in to defend himself, and he departed taking the judge with him!1663
And to this the judge bore witness, saying, “Almost1664 thou persuadest me to be a Christian.”
1665 And this ought to have happened to-day; and this Prefect, on coming among you,
ought to have admired your magnanimity, your fortitude, your perfect tranquillity; and to
have gone away, taking with him a lesson from your good order, admiring your assembly,
praising your congress, and learning from the actual fact, how great a difference there is
between Gentiles and Christians!</p>
<p>8. But as I was saying:—When Paul had caught him, and he said, “Almost thou persuadest
me to be a Christian,” Paul answered thus, “I would to God that not only thou, but also all
that hear me this day, were both almost and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.”1666
What sayest thou, O Paul? When thou writest to the Ephesians, thou sayest, “I therefore,
the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you, that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are
called.”1667 And when thou speakest to Timothy, “Wherein I suffer trouble as an evil-doer,
even unto bonds.”1668 And again, when to Philemon, thus; “Paul, a prisoner of Jesus
Christ.”1669 And again, when debating with the Jews, thou sayest, “For the hope of Israel I
am bound with this chain.”1670 And writing to the Philippians, thou sayest, “Many of the
brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word
without fear.”1671 Every where thou bearest about the chain, everywhere thou puttest forward
thy bonds, and boastest in the thing. But when thou comest to the tribunal, thou betrayest
thy philosophy, where it were right to have spoken the most boldly, and sayest to the judge,
“I would to God that thou mightest become a Christian ‘without’ these bonds!” Yet surely
if the bonds were good, and so good, that they could be the means of making others to grow
bold in the cause of true religion; (for this very thing thou didst declare before, when thou
saidst, “Many of the brethren, waxing confident by my bonds, did speak the word without

fear”); for what reason dost thou not glory in this thing in the presence of the judge, but
doest even the reverse?</p>
<p>9. Does not what I say appear a question? The solution of it, however, I will bring forward
at once. For Paul acted thus, not from distress or fear, but from an abundance of wisdom
and spiritual understanding. And how this was, I proceed to explain. He was addressing a
Gentile, and an unbeliever, who knew nothing of our matters. Hence he was unwilling to
introduce him by way of disagreeable things, but as he said, “I became to them that are
without law, as without law;”1672 so he acted in the present instance. His meaning is, “If the
Gentile hear of bonds and tribulations, he will straightway be taking flight; since he knows
not the power of bonds. First, let him become a believer; let him taste of the word preached,
and then he will even of himself hasten towards these bonds. I have heard the Lord saying,
“No man putteth a piece of new cloth into an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it
up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse. Neither do men put new wine into
old wine-skins; else the wine-skins burst.”1673 The soul of this man is an old garment: an
old wine-skin. It is not renewed by the faith, nor renovated by the grace of the Spirit. It is
yet weak and earthly. It affects the things of this life. It flutters eagerly after worldly show.
It loves a glory that is present. Should he hear at once, even from the first, that if he becomes
a Christian he will become immediately a prisoner, and will be encompassed with a chain;
feeling ashamed and indignant, he will recoil from the word preached. Therefore, saith he,
“Except these bonds.”1674 Not as deprecating the bonds themselves, God forbid! But condescending
to the other’s infirmity; for he himself loved and welcomed his bonds, even as
a woman fond of ornament doth her jewels of gold. Whence is this apparent? “I rejoice,”
saith he, “in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ
in my flesh.”1675 And again; “Unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe
on Him, but to suffer for His sake.”1676 And again; “And not only so, but we also glory in
tribulations.”1677 Wherefore, if he rejoices and glories in this, and calls it a gift of grace, it
is manifest that when he was addressing the judge, he spoke to him as he did, for the reason
assigned. Moreover, also in a different passage, when he happened to find a necessity for
glorying, he shews the very same by saying, “Most gladly, therefore, will I glory in my infirmities<gap reason="omitted"/>
in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, that the power of Christ
may rest upon me.”1678 And again; “If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which
<note type="footnote">1672 1 Cor. ix. 21.</note>

<pb n="661"/>
concern mine infirmities.”1679 And elsewhere, comparing himself with others, and exhibiting
to us his superiority in the comparison, he thus speaks; “Are they ministers of Christ? (I
speak as a fool), I am more.”1680 And wishing to shew this superiority, he did not say that
he had raised the dead, nor that he had expelled demons, nor that he had cleansed lepers,
nor that he had done any other thing of the sort, but that he had suffered those innumerable
hardships. Hence when he said,” I am more,” he presently cites the multitude of his trials;
“In stripes, above measure, in deaths oft, in prisons more frequent<gap reason="omitted"/>of the Jews five times
received I forty stripes save one, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and
a day I have been in the deep;”1681 and all the rest. Thus Paul everywhere glories in tribulations;
and prides himself upon this circumstance exceedingly. And very justly. For this it is
which especially shews the power of Christ, viz. that the Apostles conquered by such means;
by bonds, by tribulations, by scourgings, and the worst of ills.</p>
<p>10. For these two things Christ had announced, tribulation and remission, labours and
crowns, toils and rewards, things pleasant and sad. Nevertheless, to the present life he assigns
the sorrowful things; but for the life to come, he has stored up those which are pleasant; at
once shewing that He did not mean to deceive men, and wishing by this arrangement to
diminish the burden of human woes. For the imposter first holds out the things which are
pleasant, and afterwards brings forward those which are disagreeable. Thus for example:—Kidnappers,
when they intend to steal and carry off little children, do not promise them blows
and stripes, or any other thing of that kind, but offer them cakes, and sweetmeats, and such
like, by which the age of childhood is usually gratified; in order that, enticed by these things,
they may sell their liberty, and may fall into the utmost peril. Moreover, bird-catchers, and
fishermen, thus entice the prey which they pursue, offering first their usual food, and such
as is agreeable to them, and by this means concealing the snare. So that this is especially the
work of imposters, first to hold out things which are agreeable, but afterwards to introduce
the things which are disagreeable. But the case is altogether the reverse with those who are
really careful and provident for others. Fathers at least act quite in a contrary manner to
kidnappers. When they send their children to school, they set masters over them, threaten
them with stripes, and encompass them with fear on all sides. But when they have thus spent
the first portion of their lives, and their habits are formed, they then put them in possession
of honour, and power, and luxury, and all the wealth that is theirs.</p>
<p>11. And thus God has acted. After the manner of provident fathers, and not after that
of kidnappers, He has first involved us in things that are grievous; handing us over to present
tribulation, as it were to schoolmasters and teachers; in order that being chastened and
<note type="footnote">1679 2 Cor. xi. 30.</note>
<note type="footnote">1680 2 Cor. xi. 23.</note>
<note type="footnote">1681 2 Cor. xi. 23, 25.</note>

<pb n="662"/>
sobered by these things, after shewing forth all patience, and learning all right discipline,
we may afterwards, when formed into due habits, inherit the kingdom of heaven. He first
prepares and fits us for the management of the wealth He is to give, and then puts us into
the actual possession of riches. For if He had not acted thus, the giving of riches would have
been no boon, but a punishment and a vengeance. For even as a son that is senseless and
prodigal, when he has succeeded to a paternal inheritance, is precipitated headlong by this
very thing, having none of the practical wisdom requisite for the economy of wealth; but if
he be intelligent, and gentle, and sober, and moderate, managing his paternal estate as is
befitting, he becomes by this means more illustrious and distinguished: so must it also necessarily
happen in our case. When we have acquired spiritual understanding, when we
have all attained to “perfect manhood,” and the measure of full stature;” then He puts us in
possession of all that He has promised: but now as little children He chastens us, together
with consolation and soothing. And this is not the only advantage of receiving the tribulation
beforehand, but there is also another, not less than this. For the man who first of all lives
luxuriously, and then has to expect punishment after his luxurious living, has not even a
sense of his present luxury, merely by reason of the expectation of impending woes; but he
who is first in a sorrowful state, if he is anticipating the enjoyment of good things afterwards,
overlooks present difficulties, in the hope of the good things which are to come. Not only,
then, on account of our security, but also for our pleasure and consolation hath He ordained
that the things which are grievous should be first; in order that being lightened with the
hope of futurity, we should be rendered insensible to what is present. And this Paul would
shew and make plain, when he said, “Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh
for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. While we look not at the things
which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.”1682 He calls tribulation light, not because
of the intrinsic nature of things that are grievous, but because of the expectation of
good things to come. For even as the merchant is indifferent to the labour that attends
navigation, being buoyed up with the hope of a cargo; and as the boxer bravely sustains the
blows on his head, looking to the crown beyond; so also indeed do we, earnestly gazing towards
heaven, and the good things that are in the heavens, whatever evils come on us, sustain
them all with fortitude, being nerved with the good hope of the things to come.</p>
<p>12. Therefore let us go home, taking with us this saying;1683 for though it be simple and
short, it nevertheless contains much of the doctrine of spiritual wisdom. He who is in a state
of grief and tribulation, hath a sufficient consolation; he who lives in luxury and abundance,
hath that which may greatly sober him. For when as thou sittest at the table thou art reminded
of this saying, thou wilt speedily shrink from drunkenness and gluttony; learning through
<note type="footnote">1682 2 Cor. iv. 17, 18.</note>
<note type="footnote">1683 i.e., Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</note>

<pb n="663"/>
this sentence, how needful it is for us to be striving; and thou wilt say with thyself, “Paul
lived in bonds and in dungeons, but I in drunkenness and at a luxurious table! What pardon
then shall I obtain?” This also is a fit saying for women; since those who are fond of ornament,
and expensive dresses, and bind themselves about with gold on every side, when they remember
this chain, will hate, I feel assured, and abominate that adorning of themselves;
and will hasten to such bonds as these. For those ornaments have often been the cause of
manifold evils, and introduced a thousand quarrels into a family, and have bred envy, and
jealousy, and hatred. But these loosed the sins of the wide world, affrighted demons, and
drove away the devil. With these, while tarrying in prison, he persuaded the jailor; with
these he attracted Agrippa himself; with these he procured many disciples. Therefore he
said, “Wherein I suffer trouble as an evil-doer unto bonds, but the word of God is not
bound.”1684 For just as it is not possible to bind a sunbeam, or to shut it up within the house,
so neither the preaching of the word; and what was much more, the teacher was bound, and
yet the word flew abroad; he inhabited the prison, and yet his doctrine rapidly winged its
way every where throughout the world!</p>
<p>Knowing these things then, let us not be depressed, when adverse affairs meet us, but
then let us be more strong, then more powerful; “for tribulation worketh patience.”1685 Let
us not grieve for the calamities which befall us, but let us in all things give thanks unto God!</p>
<p>13. We have completed the second week of the fast, but this we should not consider; for
going through the fast does not consist in merely going through the time, but in going
through it with amendment of manners. Let us consider this; whether we have become more
diligent; whether we have corrected any of our defects; whether we have washed away our
sins? It is common for every one to ask in Lent, how many weeks each has fasted; and some
may be heard saying that they have fasted two, others three, and others that they have fasted
the whole of the weeks. But what advantage is it, if we have gone through the fast devoid of
good works? If another says, “I have fasted the whole of Lent,” do thou say, “I had an enemy,
but I was reconciled; I had a custom of evil-speaking, but I put a stop to it; I had a custom
of swearing, but I have broken through this evil practice.” It is of no advantage to merchants,
to have gone over a great extent of ocean, but to have sailed with a freight and much merchandise.
The fast will profit us nothing, if we pass through it as a mere matter of course,
without any result. If we practise a mere abstinence from meats, when the forty days are
past, the fast is over too. But if we abstain from sins, this still remains, even when the fast
has gone by, and will be from this time a continual advantage to us; and will here render us
no small recompense, before we attain unto the kingdom of heaven. For as he who is living
in iniquity, even before hell, hath punishment, being stung by his conscience; so the man
<note type="footnote">1684 2 Tim. ii. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">1685 Rom. v. 3.</note>

<pb n="664"/>
who is rich in good works, even before the kingdom, will have the benefit of exceeding joy,
in that he is nourished with blessed hopes.</p>
<p>14. Therefore Christ says, “I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your
joy no man taketh from you.”1686 A brief saying, but one that hath in it much consolation.
What then is this, “your joy no man taketh?” if thou hast money, many are able to take away
the joy that comes of thy wealth; as, for instance, a thief, by digging through the wall; a servant
by carrying off what was entrusted to him; an emperor by confiscation; and the envious
man by contumely. Should you possess power, there are many who are able to deprive you
of the joy of it. For when the conditions of office are at an end, the conditions of pleasure
will also be ended. And in the exercise of office itself too, there are many accidents occurring,
which by bringing difficulty and care, strike at the root of thy satisfaction. If thou hast
bodily strength, the assaults of disease put a stop to joy from that source. If thou hast beauty
and bloom, the approach of old age withers it, and takes away that joy. Or if thou enjoyest
a sumptuous table, when evening comes on the joy of the banquet is at an end; for every
thing belonging to this life is liable to damage, and is unable to afford us a lasting pleasure;
but piety and the virtue of the soul is altogether the reverse of this. If thou hast done an
alms, no one is able to take away this good work. Though an army, or kings, or myriads of
calumniators and conspirators, were to beset thee on all sides, they could not take away the
possession, once deposited in heaven; but the joy thereof continually abideth; for it is said,
“He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor, his righteousness endureth for ever.”1687
And very justly; for in the storehouses of heaven it is laid up, where no thief breaks in, nor
robber seizes, nor moth devours.1688 If thou pourest out continued and fervent prayers, no
man will be able to spoil thee of the fruit of them; for this fruit too is rooted in the heavens;
it is out of the way of all injury, and remains beyond mortal reach. If when evil-treated thou
has done a kind action; if thou hast borne with patience to hear thyself evil spoken of; if
thou hast returned blessings for reproaches; these are good works that abide continually,
and the joy of them no man taketh away; but as often as thou rememberest these, thou art
glad and rejoicest, and reapest large fruits of pleasure. So also, indeed, if we succeed in
avoiding oaths; and persuade our tongue to abstain from this pernicious practice, the good
work will be finished in a short time, but the delight arising from it will be continuous and
unfailing.</p>
<p>15. And now, it is time that you should be teachers and guides of others; that friends
should undertake to instruct and lead on their neighbours; servants their fellow-servants;
and youths those of their own age. What if any one had promised thee a single piece of gold
<note type="footnote">1686 John xvi. 22.</note>
<note type="footnote">1687 Ps. cxii. 9.</note>
<note type="footnote">1688 Matt. vi. 19; Luke xii. 33.</note>

<pb n="665"/>
for every man who was reformed, wouldest thou not then have used every exertion, and
been all day long sitting by them, persuading and exhorting. Yet now God promises thee
not one piece of gold, nor ten, or twenty, or a hundred, or a thousand; no, nor the whole
earth, for thy labours, but He gives thee that which is greater than all the world, the kingdom
of heaven; and not only this, but also another thing besides it. And what kind of thing is
that? “He who taketh forth the precious from the vile,”1689 saith He, “shall be as my
mouth.”1690 What can be equal to this in point of honour or security? What kind of excuse
or pardon can be left to those, who after so great a promise neglect their neighbour’s safety?
Now if you see a blind man falling into a pit, you stretch forth a hand, and think it a disgraceful
thing to overlook one who is about to perish? But daily beholding all thy brethren precipitated
into the wicked custom of oaths, dost thou not dare even to utter a word? Thou
hast spoken once, perhaps, and he hath not heard. Speak therefore twice, and thrice, and as
often as it may be, till thou hast persuaded him. Every day God is addressing us, and we do
not hear; and yet He does not leave off speaking. Do thou, therefore, imitate this tender care
towards thy neighbour. For this reason it is that we are placed with one another; that we
inhabit cities, and that we meet together in churches, in order that we may bear one another’s
burdens, that we may correct one another’s sins. And in the same manner as persons inhabiting
the same shop, carry on a separate traffic, yet put all afterwards into the common fund,
so also let us act. Whatever advantages each man is able to confer upon his neighbour, let
him not grudge, nor shrink from doing it, but let there be some such kind of spiritual
commerce, and reciprocity; in order that having deposited every thing in the common store,
and obtained great riches, and procured a large treasure, we may be all together partakers
of the kingdom of heaven; through the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ,
by Whom and with Whom, to the Father, with the Holy Ghost, be glory, both now and ever,
and world without end. Amen.</p>

the Offices1692) sent by the Emperor Theodosius for the inquisition of the offenders, on
account of the overturning of the Statues.</p>
<p>1. Most opportunely have we all this day sung together, “Blessed be the Lord God of
Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.”1693 For marvellous, and beyond all expectation,
are the things which have happened? A whole city, and so great a population, when just
about to be overwhelmed—to sink under the waves, and to be utterly and instantly destroyed—
He hath entirely rescued from shipwreck in a single moment of time! Let us give
thanks then, not only that God hath calmed the tempest, but that He suffered it to take place;
not only that He rescued us from shipwreck, but that He allowed us to fall into such distress;
and such an extreme peril to hang over us. Thus also Paul bids us “in every thing give
thanks.”1694 But when he says, “In every thing give thanks,” he means not only in our deliverance
from evils, but also at the time when we suffer those evils. “For all things work together
for good to them that love God.”1695 Let us be thankful to Him for this deliverance from
trials; and let us never forget them. Let us devote ourselves to prayer, to continual supplications,
and to much piety.</p>
<p>2. When the sad conflagration of these calamities was first kindled, I said, that it was a
season not for doctrine, but for prayer.1696 The very same thing I now repeat, when the fire
has been extinguished—that it is now especially, and more than before, a time for prayer;
that now is the season especially for tears and compunction, for an anxious soul, for much
diligence, and for much caution. For at that time the very nature of our tribulation restrained
us, however unwillingly, and disposed us to sobriety; and led us to become more religious;
but now when the bridle is removed, and the cloud has passed away, there is fear lest we
should fall back again into sloth, or become relaxed by this respite; and lest one should have
reason to say of us too, “When He slew them, then they sought Him, and returned, and

enquired early after God.”1697 Wherefore also Moses admonished the Jews, saying, “When
thou shalt have eaten, and drunk, and art full, remember the Lord thy God.”1698 The
goodness of your disposition will now be rendered manifest, if you continue in the practice
of the same piety. For at that time, many imputed your earnestness to fear, and the approach
of calamity; but now, it will be purely your own achievement, if you still persevere in
maintaining this earnestness. Since with a boy too, as long as he is guided by some tutor
whom he fears, if he lives with sobriety and meekness, there is nothing to admire, for all
persons ascribe the sobriety of the stripling to his fear of the tutor. But when he remains in
the same seemly behaviour, after the restraint from that quarter is done away with, all persons
give him credit too for the sobriety that was seen in his earlier age. Thus also let us act; let
us continue in the same state of godly fear, in order that for our former diligence too we
may gain much praise from God.</p>
<p>3. We had expected innumerable woes; that our property would be plundered, that the
houses would have been burnt together with their inmates, that the city would have been
plucked up from the midst of the world, that its very fragments would have been utterly
destroyed, and that its soil would have been placed under the plough! But, lo! all these things
existed only in expectation, and did not come into operation. And this is not the only
wonder, that God hath removed so great a danger, but that He hath also greatly blessed us,
and adorned our city; and by this trial and calamity hath made us more approved! But how,
I will state. When those who were sent by the Emperor erected that fearful tribunal for
making inquisition into the events which had taken place, and summoned every one to give
account of the deeds which they had perpetrated, and various anticipations of death pervaded
the minds of all, then the monks who dwelt on the mountain-tops shewed their own true
philosophy. For although they had been shut up so many years in their cells, yet at no one’s
entreaty, by no one’s counsel, when they beheld such a cloud overhanging the city, they left
their caves and huts, and flocked together in every direction, as if they had been so many
angels arriving from heaven. Then might one see the city likened to heaven, while these
saints appeared everywhere; by their mere aspect consoling the mourners, and leading them
to an utter disregard of the calamity. For who on beholding these would not deride death,
would not despise life. And not only was this wonderful, but that when they drew nigh to
the magistrates themselves, they spoke to them with boldness on behalf of the accused, and
were all ready to shed their blood, and to lay down their heads, so that they might snatch
the captured from the terrible events which they expected. They also declared that they
would not depart until the judges should spare the population of the city, or send them
themselves together with the accused to the Emperor. “He,” said they, “who rules over our
<note type="footnote">1697 Ps. lxxviii. 34.</note>
<note type="footnote">1698 Deut. vi. 11, 12.</note>

<pb n="668"/>
portion of the world is a godly man, a believer, one who lives in the practice of piety. We
therefore shall assuredly reconcile him. We will not give you leave, nor permit you to embrue
the sword, or take off a head. But if ye do not desist, we also are quite resolved to die with
them. We confess that the crimes committed are very heinous; but the iniquity of those
deeds does not surpass the humanity of the Emperor.” One of them is also reported to have
uttered another saying, full of wisdom, to this effect:1699 “The Statues which have been
thrown down are again set up, and have resumed their proper appearance; and the mischief
was speedily rectified; but if ye put to death the image of God, how will ye be again able to
revoke the deed! or how to reanimate those who are deprived of life, and to restore their
souls to their bodies?” Many things too they said to them of the Judgment.</p>
<p>4. Who could but be astonished? Who could but admire the moral wisdom of these
men? When the mother of one of the accused, uncovering her head, and exposing her grey
hairs, laid hold of the horse of the judge by the bridle, and running beside him through the
forum, thus entered with him the place of justice, we were all struck with astonishment, we
all admired that exceeding tenderness and magnanimity.1700 Ought we not, then, to have
been much more impressed with wonder at the conduct of these men? For if she had even
died for her son, it would have been nothing strange, since great is the tyranny of nature,
and irresistible is the obligation arising from the maternal pangs! But these men so loved
those whom they had not begotten, whom they had not brought up, yea rather, whom they
had never seen, whom they had not heard of, whom they had never met, whom they knew
only from their calamity, that if they had possessed a thousand lives, they would have chosen
to deliver them all up for their safety. Tell me not that they were not slaughtered, that they
did not pour forth their blood, but that they used as much boldness with their judges as it
was likely that no other men would do, but such as had already renounced their own lives;
and that with this sentiment they ran from the mountains to the tribunal. For, indeed, if
they had not before prepared themselves against every sort of slaughter, they would not
have been able to speak thus freely to the judges, or to have manifested such magnanimity.
For they remained all day long sitting before the doors of the place of justice, being prepared
to snatch from the hands of the executioners those who were about to be led off to punishment!</p>
<p>5. Where now are those who are clad in threadbare cloaks, and display a long beard,
and carry staves in the right hand; the philosophers of the world,1701 who are more abject

<pb n="669"/>
in disposition than the dogs under the table; and do every thing for the sake of the belly?
All these men then forsook the city, they all hasted away, and hid themselves in caves! But
they only, who truly by works manifest the love of wisdom, appeared as fearlessly in the
forum, as if no evil had overtaken the city. And the inhabitants of the city fled away to the
mountains and to the deserts, but the citizens of the desert hastened into the city; demonstrating
by deeds what, on the preceding days, I have not desisted from saying, that the very
furnace will not be able to harm the man who leads a virtuous life. Such a thing is philosophy
of soul, rising superior to all things, and to all prosperous or adverse events; for neither is
it enfeebled by the former, nor beaten down and debased by the latter, but abides on the
same level through the whole course of things, shewing its own native force and power!
Who, indeed, was not convicted of weakness by the difficulty of the present crisis? Those
who had held the first offices in our city, who were in places of power, who were surrounded
with immense wealth, and who were in high favour with the Emperor, leaving their houses
utterly deserted, all consulted their own safety, and all friendship and kindred were found
worthless, and those whom they formerly knew, at this season of calamity, they desired not
to know, and prayed to be unknown of them! But the monks, poor as they were, having
nothing more than a mean garment, who had lived in the coarsest manner, who seemed
formerly to be nobodies, men habituated to mountains and forests; as if they had been so
many lions, with a great and lofty soul, whilst all were fearing and quaking, stood forth and
relieved the danger, and that, not in the course of many days, but in a brief moment of time!
And as distinguished warriors without coming into close conflict with their adversaries, but
merely by making their appearance in the ranks, and shouting, put the foe to rout, so also
these in one day descended, and said their say, and removed the calamity, and returned to
their own tabernacles. So great is the moral wisdom that was brought among men by Christ.</p>
<p>6. And why do I speak of the rich, and of those in authority? When those very persons
who had been invested with power to judge the criminals; who acted with the highest authority,
were entreated by these selfsame monks to grant a sentence of pardon, they said,
they had no power over the result; for that it was unsafe and dangerous, not only to insult
the Emperor, but even to dismiss those who had insulted him, when taken, without punishment.
But these men were too powerful for any one to resist; and besieging them by magnanimity
and perseverance, they induced these officers by their importunity to exercise a
power which they had not received from the Emperor; and even succeeded in persuading
the judges, when men had been manifestly convicted of the guilt, not to declare the sentence
of condemnation, but to defer the final result to the decision of the Emperor; and they
promised certainly to persuade him to grant a pardon to those who had transgressed against
him; and they were about to set out on a journey to him. But the judges, reverencing the
moral wisdom of these men, and being struck with their loftiness of spirit, did not permit
them to undertake this long journey, but promised that if they should only receive their

<pb n="670"/>
words in writing, they would themselves depart and successfully importune1702 the Emperor
to dismiss all anger (which, indeed, we are now expecting that he will). For when sentence
should have been given, they, on being admitted into court, uttered words of the highest
wisdom, and besought the Emperor by letters to shew mercy; and they reminded him of
the Judgment, and said that they would lay down their own heads, if his mercy was not
granted. And the judges took down these words in writing, and departed. This, more than
the brightest crown, will adorn our city. And what has here taken place, the Emperor will
now hear; yea, the great City will hear, and the whole world will hear, that the monks who
dwell at the city of Antioch, are men who have displayed an apostolic boldness; and now
when their letters are read at court, all men will admire their magnanimity; all men will call
our city blessed; and we shall shake off our evil reputation; and it will be known every where,
that what has happened was not the work of the inhabitants of the city, but of strangers and
corrupt-minded men; and that this testimony of the monks will be a sufficient evidence of
the character of the city.</p>
<p>7. Therefore, beloved, let us not be distressed, but let us entertain favourable hopes; for
if their boldness toward men has been able to prevent such a danger, then what will not
their boldness toward God effect? These things also let us tell the Greeks, when they dare
to dispute with us respecting their philosophers! From hence it is manifest that their stories
of former days are false, but that the things of old reported among us are true; that is, the
things concerning John, and Paul, and Peter, and all the rest. For inasmuch as these monks
have succeeded to the piety of those men, they have consequently exhibited their boldness.
Inasmuch as they were brought up in the same laws, they have consequently imitated their
virtues. So that we stand in no need of writings for the purpose of shewing the apostolical
virtues, whilst the very facts cry aloud, and the masters are shewn forth by the scholars. We
have no need of disputation to display the trifling of the Greeks, and the little-mindedness
of their philosophers, whilst their deeds now loudly proclaim, as they did aforetime, that all
with them is a fable, a stage-play, a piece of acting.</p>
<p>8. And the same magnanimity was displayed by the priests too, as well as the monks,
and they shared among them the charge of our safety. One1703 of them, indeed, proceeded
to court, esteeming all things as secondary to the love of you; and being himself ready, if he
could not persuade the Emperor, to lay down his own life. And these, who remained here,
have displayed the same virtues as the monks themselves; and holding fast the judges with
their own hands, they would not let them enter into the court, before they gave a promise
respecting the result of the trial. And when they saw them making signs of refusal, they
<note type="footnote">1702 δυσωπήσειν: same word as is rendered above “induced by importunity.” Literally, “to put out of countenance;”
to make another ashamed not to grant a request.</note>
<note type="footnote">1703 The bishop, spoken of in the opening of Hom. III. and in Hom. XXI.</note>

<pb n="671"/>
again exerted themselves with much boldness; and as soon as they saw that they did consent,
embracing their feet and knees, and kissing their hands, they gave an exceeding proof of
either virtue, of liberty and meekness. For that theirs was not the boldness of presumption,
they plainly signified by their kissing the knees, and embracing the feet of the judges. Again,
in proof that this was not flattery, nor a kind of fawning servility, nor the fruit of a slavish
spirit, their former acts attested their boldness. And these are not the only good results we
have reaped from the trial, but also an abundance of sobriety and meekness; and our city
has become all at once a monastery.1704 Not thus would any one have adorned it, had he
erected golden statues in the forum, as it has now been adorned and distinguished, in producing
those beautiful images of virtue, and displaying its true riches!</p>
<p>9. But it may be that the things which the Emperor hath decreed are painful. No! not
even these are really burdensome, but have brought much advantage with them. For what
is there, I ask, which is oppressive in any of them? that the Emperor hath shut up the Orchestra,
that he hath forbidden the Hippodrome, that he hath closed and stopped up these
fountains of iniquity. May they never again be opened! From thence did the roots of
wickedness shoot forth to the injury of the city!1705 From thence sprung those who blast its
character; men who sell their voices1706 to the dancers, and who for the sake of three obols
prostitute their salvation to them, turning all things upside down! Art thou distressed, O
beloved! for these things? Truly it were fitting that for these thou shouldest be glad, and rejoice,
and express thy thanks to the Emperor, since his castigation hath proved a correction,
his punishment a discipline, his wrath a means of instruction! But that the Baths are shut
up? Neither is this an intolerable hardship, that those who lead a soft, effeminate, and dissolute
life, should be brought back, though unwillingly, to the love of true wisdom.</p>
<p>10. But is it complained of, that the Emperor hath taken away the dignity of the city,
and hath no more permitted it to be called a metropolis?1707 But what was he to do? Could
he praise what had been done, and acknowledge it as a favour? Then who would not have
blamed him, for not shewing even the outward form of indignation? Seest thou not that
fathers do many things of a similar nature towards their children? They turn away from
them, and forbid them the table. This also hath the Emperor done by imposing such punishments
as have nothing in them hurtful, but carry with them much correction. Think
what we expected, and what has taken place, and then we shall especially discern the favour

of God! Dost thou grieve that the dignity of the city is taken away? Learn what the dignity
of a city is; and then thou wilt know clearly, that if the inhabitants do not betray it, no one
else will be able to take away the dignity of a city! Not the fact that it is a metropolis; nor
that it contains large and beautiful buildings;1708 nor that it has many columns, and spacious
porticoes and walks, nor that it is named in proclamations before other cities, but the virtue
and piety of its inhabitants; this is a city’s dignity, and ornament, and defence; since if these
things are not found in it, it is the most insignificant in the world, though it may enjoy unlimited
honour from Emperors! Dost thou wish to learn the dignity of thy city? Dost thou
wish to know its ancestry? I will tell it exactly; not only that thou mayest know, but that
thou mayest also emulate. What then is after all the dignity of this city of ours? “It came to
pass, that the disciples were first called Christians at Antioch.”1709 This dignity, none of the
cities throughout the world possesses, not even the city of Romulus herself! For this it can
look the whole world in the face; on account of that love toward Christ, that boldness and
virtue.1710 Dost thou wish farther to hear of a different dignity and commendation belonging
to this city? A grievous famine was once approaching, and the inhabitants of Antioch determined,
as far as each person had the means, to send relief to the Saints dwelling at Jerusalem.
1711 Behold a second dignity, charity in a time of famine! The season did not make
them niggardly, nor the expectation of the calamity backward in helping; but when all are
apt to be scraping up what is not their own, then they distributed their own, not merely to
those who were near, but also to those who were living afar off! Seest thou here the faith
towards God, and the love towards their neighbour? Wouldest thou learn another dignity
of this city? Certain men came down from Judæa to Antioch, defiling1712 the doctrine
preached, and introducing Jewish observances.1713 The men of Antioch did not bear this
novelty in silence. They did not hold their peace, but having come together, and made an
assembly, they sent Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem, and caused the Apostles to provide
that pure doctrines, cleared from all Jewish imperfection, might be distributed throughout
all parts of the world! This is the dignity of the city! this is its precedence! this makes it a
metropolis, not in the earth, but in heaven; forasmuch as that all other honours are corruptible,
and fleeting, and perish with the present life, and often come to their end before the

close of it, as they have done in the present instance! To me, a city that hath not pious citizens
is meaner than any village, and more ignoble than any cave.</p>
<p>11. And why do I speak of a city? For that thou mayest exactly understand that virtue
alone is the ornament of the inhabitants, I will not speak to thee of a city, but I will endeavour
to demonstrate this by bringing forward what is more venerable than any city—the Temple
of God which was in Jerusalem. For this was the Temple in which were sacrifices and prayers
and services; where was the Holy of Holies, and the Cherubim, the Covenant,1714 and the
golden pot;1715 the great symbols of God’s providence towards that people; where oracles
from heaven were constantly being received, where prophets became inspired, where the
fashioning was not the work of human art, but proceeded from the wisdom of God, where
the walls were on every side resplendent with much gold, and where, in surpassing excellence,
costliness of material and perfection of art met together, and demonstrated that there was
no other temple like this upon earth! Yea rather, not only the perfection of art, but also the
wisdom of God assisted in that building. For Solomon had learned all, not intuitively and
from himself, but from God;1716 and having received the design of it from the heavens, he
then marked it out and erected it. Nevertheless, this Temple, thus beautiful and marvellous
and sacred, when those who used it were corrupted, was so dishonoured, despised, and
profaned, that even before the captivity it was called “a den of robbers, a cave of hyænas;”1717
and afterwards it was delivered over to hands that were barbarous, polluted, and profane!</p>
<p>12. Wouldest thou learn the same truth respecting cities? What could be more illustrious
than the cities of Sodom? For the houses and the buildings were splendid, and so were their
walls; and the country was fat and fertile, and “like the Paradise of God.”1718 But the tent
of Abraham was mean and small, and had no fortification. Yet when a foreign war took
place, the strangers broke down and took the walled cities, and departed, carrying away
their inhabitants captives. Abraham, however, the citizen of the desert, they could not resist
when he attacked them! And so it was likely to be. For he had true piety: a power much
greater than numbers and the defence of walls. If thou art a Christian, no earthly city is
thine. Of our City “the Builder and Maker is God.”1719 Though we may gain possession of
the whole world, we are withal but strangers and sojourners in it all! We are enrolled in
heaven: our citizenship is there! Let us not, after the manner of little children, despise things
that are great, and admire those which are little! Not our city’s greatness, but virtue of soul

is our ornament and defence. If you suppose dignity to belong to a city, think how many
persons must partake in this dignity, who are whoremongers, effeminate, depraved and full
of ten thousand evil things, and at last despise such honour! But that City above is not of
this kind; for it is impossible that he can be a partaker of it, who has not exhibited every
virtue.</p>
<p>13. Let us not therefore be senseless; but then let us grieve when any one deprives us of
our dignity of soul, when we commit sin, when we have offended the common Lord of all;
since as regards the things that have now befallen us, so far are they from injuring the city,
that if we are watchful, they will greatly benefit us. For even already our city seems to be like
a decorous, noble, sober-minded matron. Fear hath made her gentler and more dignified,
and hath delivered her from those miscreants who were concerned in the late audacious
deeds. Let us therefore not give way to womanish lamentations. For I have heard many
about the forum saying, “Alas! for thee, Antioch! What hath befallen thee! How art thou
dishonoured!” Truly when I heard, I smiled at the puerile mind which could give vent to
these words! Such words were not becoming now; but when thou seest men dancing,
drunken, singing, blaspheming, swearing, perjuring themselves, and lying, then apply such
a saying as this: “Alas! for thee, O city, what hath befallen thee!” But if thou seest the forum
containing a few meek, modest, and temperate persons, then pronounce the city, “Blessed!”
For the fewness will never be able to injure it in any respect, if there be virtue withal; as on
the other hand, numbers will never profit it at all, whilst iniquity is there. “If,” saith the
prophet, “the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be
saved;”1720 that is to say, “Multitude will never prevail with Me.” So also Christ spoke. He
called cities wretched; not because of their littleness, nor because they were not of metropolitan
rank.1721 And Jerusalem itself again, He calls wretched for the very same reason,
speaking thus; “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem; thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them
which are sent unto thee!”1722 For what advantage, I ask, does a multitude bring, if their
system of living be vicious? Nay, on the contrary, even injury results from it. What else, indeed,
hath wrought the evils which have lately sprung up? Was it not the sloth, the recklessness,
and the depravity of the inhabitants? Did the dignity of the city, did the magnificence
of its architecture, or the circumstance that it was a metropolis, do it any service? If with
the king who is on earth, nothing could protect it when it had done thus amiss, but all these
privileges are taken away; much more with the Lord of angels will its dignity fail to protect
it? For at that Day, it will nought avail us, that we have dwelt in a metropolis, that has many
spacious porticoes, and other dignities of this kind! And why do I say, at That Day? For as
<note type="footnote">1720 Isa. x. 22; Rom. ix. 27.</note>
<note type="footnote">1721 It is possible that a clause may have been omitted here. If not, the next sentence refers back beyond this.</note>
<note type="footnote">1722 Matt. xxiii. 37.</note>

<pb n="675"/>
regards the present life, what can it benefit thee that this thy city is a metropolis? Pray, has
any one restored a distressed family by means of this? or received any revenue from this
dignity? or dispelled sadness? or got rid of any bodily infirmity? or put away a vice of the
soul? Beloved! let us not trifle, nor regard the opinions of the multitude, but understand
what is indeed the dignity of a city; what it is that makes a city truly a metropolis?</p>
<p>14. I say all this, though I expect that the city will again regain even this outward distinction,
and appear in its own proper place of precedence. For the Emperor is both philanthropic
and godly. But I am desirous that if it should be restored, ye may not think too much of this;
nor be boastful of it; nor place the honour of our city to that account. When you wish to
pronounce an encomium on the city, tell me not of the suburb of Daphne,1723 nor of the
height and multitude of its cypresses, nor of its fountains of waters, nor of the great population
who inhabit the city, nor of the great freedom with which its market-place is frequented
even to midnight, nor of the abundance of its wares! All these are things of the outward
sense, and remain only as long as the present life. But if you are able to mention virtue,
meekness, alms-giving, nocturnal vigils, prayers, sobriety, true wisdom of soul; commend
the city for these things! To those who inhabit the desert, the presence of these things makes
it more illustrious than any city; and again the vilest of all places,1724 should these things
not be found with its citizens. Let us make this estimate not in the case of cities only, but
also of men. And if you see a big man, who has been brought into good condition, tall, and
surpassing others in length of limb, do not admire him, until you have ascertained what the
man’s soul is. Not from the outward comeliness, but from the beauty that. appertains to the
soul, should we pronounce any persons blessed! David was little, and short of stature; nevertheless,
one so short and little, and bare of all arms, brought down at one blow so large
an army, and that tower of flesh; and this without hurling spear, or letting fly arrow, or unsheathing
sword, but doing all with a small pebble! For this reason a certain one exhorts,
saying, “Commend not a man for his beauty, neither abhor a man for his outward appearance.
The bee is little among such as fly, but her fruit is the chief of sweet things.”1725</p>

and be continually thankful to God, as well for present as for past mercies; and call

upon Him in common with all our might, that those who now dwell in prison1726 may be
discharged, and that those who are about to be sent into exile may return back again. They
too are our members. With us they have buffetted the waves, with us they have withstood
the storm! Let us, then, beseech the merciful God, that with us they may enjoy the calm! Let
no one say, “What farther concerns me? I am freed from danger; such an one may perish;
such another may be destroyed!” Let us not provoke God by this indifference; but lament,
as if we ourselves were in the same peril. So let us supplicate God with intense earnestness,
fulfilling that saying of Paul, “Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and
them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.1727 Weeping also with
them that weep; condescending to men of low estate.”1728 This will also be of the greatest
advantage to ourselves; for nothing useth so much to delight God, as that we should be very
ready to mourn for our own members. Him therefore let us supplicate in common, both
for things present, and for things to come; in order that He may deliver us from punishment
hereafter. For the things present, whatever they are, are endurable, and have an end; but the
torments there are immortal, and interminable! And while we are consoled, let us also
ourselves endeavour to fall no more into such sins, knowing that hereafter1729 we shall enjoy
no pardon! Let us, then, all in common prostrate ourselves before God; and both while we
are here, and when we are at home, let us say, “Thou, O Lord, art righteous in all things
which Thou hast done towards us; for Thou hast brought upon us by a just judgment
whatever Thou hast brought.”1730 If “our sins rise up against us, undertake for us, for thy
Name’s sake;”1731 and do not permit us any more to experience such grievous troubles.
“Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for Thine is the kingdom, the Power,
and the Glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XVIII.</head>
<p>The former subject of the Sedition continued; also of fasting; and upon the Apostolic saying,
“Rejoice in the Lord always.”1732</p>
<p>1. I have observed many persons rejoicing, and saying one to another, “We have
conquered; we have prevailed; the half of the fast is spent.” But I exhort such persons not
to rejoice on this account, that the half of the fast is gone, but to consider whether the half
of their sins be gone; and if so, then to exult. For this is a fit subject of gratification. This is
what is to be sought after, and for which all things are done, that we may correct our defects;
and that we may not quit the fast the same persons as we entered upon it, but in a cleansed
state; and that having laid aside all that belongs to evil habits, we may thus keep the sacred
feast, since if the case be otherwise, we shall be so far from obtaining any advantage, that
the completion of the fast will be the greatest injury to us. Let us, therefore, not rejoice that
we have gone through the length of the fast, for this is nothing great; but let us rejoice, if we
have got through it with fresh attainments, so that when this is over, the fruit of it may shine
forth. For the gain of winter is more especially manifested after the season is gone by. Then,
the flourishing corn, and the trees teeming with leaves and fruit, proclaim, by their appearance,
the benefit that has accrued to them from the winter! Let the same thing also take
place with us. For during the winter, we have enjoyed divers and frequent showers, having
been during the fast partakers of a continued course of instruction, and have received spiritual
seeds, and cut away the thorns of luxury.</p>
<p>2. Wherefore let us persevere, retaining with all diligence what we have heard; that when
the fast is over, the fruit of the fast may abound, and that by the good things we gathered
from the fast, we may remember the fast itself.1733 If thus we fashion ourselves, we shall,
when the fast returns, welcome it again with pleasure. For I see many who are so feebleminded,
that at the present season they are anxious about the following Lent; and I have
heard many saying, that after their liberation from the fast, they are insensible to any
pleasure from this remission, on account of their anxiety about the coming year. What can
be more feeble-minded than this? I ask; and what is the cause of this? It is, that when the
fast is arrived, we do not take pains that the concerns of the soul may be well ordered, but
we limit the fast solely to an abstinence from food. Since, were we to reap the full benefit of
it in a reformation of conduct, we should wish the fast to come round every day, receiving
in very deed an experience of its good effects; and we should never cast away the desire of
it, or be dejected and anxious whilst expecting it.</p>
<note type="footnote">1732 Phil. iv. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">1733 See end of Hom. VI.</note>

<pb n="678"/>
<p>3. For there is nothing whatever that will be able to afflict one who is well ordered in
mind, and careful about his own soul; but he will enjoy a pure and continued pleasure. And
that this is true ye have to-day heard from Paul, who exhorts us, saying, “Rejoice in the Lord
always, and again I say, rejoice.”1734 I know indeed that to many this saying seems impossible.
“For how is it possible,” says some one, “that he who is but a man, can continually rejoice?
To rejoice is no hard matter, but to rejoice continually, this seems to me to be impossible.”
For many are the causes of sadness, which surround us on all sides. A man has lost either a
son, or a wife, or a beloved friend, more necessary to him than all kindred; or he has to
sustain the loss of wealth; or he has fallen into sickness; or he has to bear some other change
of fortune; or to grieve for contemptuous treatment which he did not deserve; or famine,
or pestilence, or some intolerable exaction, or circumstances in his family trouble him;—nay,
there is no saying how many circumstances of a public or private nature are accustomed to
occasion us grief. How then, he may say, is it possible to “rejoice always?” Yea, O man! it is
possible; and if it were not so, Paul would not have given the exhortation; nor would a man
endowed with spiritual wisdom have offered such counsel; and for this reason I have constantly
said to you, and will not cease to say, that what ye could no where have learnt from
any other, that wisdom ye may here meditate. For mankind are universally desirous of
pleasure,1735 and of rejoicing; and for this, they do all, say all, and undertake all things.
Therefore it is, that the merchant goes on a voyage, in order that he may amass wealth; and
he amasses wealth, to the end that he may rejoice over what he has treasured up. The soldier
also for this reason exercises his warfare, and the husbandman his husbandry; for this each
man plies his art. Those also who love dominion, love it for this end, that they may obtain
glory; and they desire to obtain glory, that they may rejoice; and any one may perceive that
each of our undertakings is directed to this point, and that every man looking to this makes
haste to go towards it through a variety of means.</p>
<p>4. For as I said, all love gladness, but all are not able to attain it, since they know not the
way which leads to it; but many suppose that the source of it is in being rich. But if this were
its source, no one possessed of wealth would ever be sad. But in fact many of the rich think
life not worth living, and would infinitely prefer death when they experience any hardship;
and of all men these are the most liable to excessive sadness. For you should not look to
<note type="footnote">1734 Phil. iv. 4.</note>
<note type="footnote">1735 See Arist. Eth. 1, ch. 5, and Plat. Phileb., where the general aim of human action is discussed. Speaking
popularly, St. Chrysostom does not enquire by what name it is most correct to call the real object of our desires.
He is satisfied with shewing that the highest pleasure, satisfaction, joy, or whatever it may be called, is found in
God. And this is a better beginning, for practical purposes, than a philosophical definition. But see Hooker, b.
i. c. vii. and Butler, ser. xi. xii. xiii.</note>

<pb n="679"/>
their tables, or their flatterers, and parasites, but to the trouble that comes of such things,
the insults, the calumnies, the dangers, and the distresses, and what is far worse, that they
meet these reverses unpractised, and know not how to take them philosophically, or to bear
with fortitude what befalls them; whence it happens that calamities do not appear to them
such as they are in their own nature, but even things which are really light come to seem
intolerable; whereas, with regard to the poor, the contrary takes place; things that are irremediable
seem easy to be borne, since they are familiar with many such. For it is not so
much the nature of the events as the disposition of the sufferers, that makes the evils which
come upon us seem great or small. And that I may not go a long way off for examples of
both these facts, I will speak to you of what has lately befallen ourselves. Behold then how
all the poor escaped, and the populace are delivered from the danger, and enjoy an entire
freedom! but those who manage the affairs of the city, the men who keep their studs of
horses, and preside over the public games, and such as have borne other public charges,1736
they are now the inmates of the prison, and fear the worst; and they alone pay the penalty
of the deeds that have been perpetrated by all, and are in a state of constant terror; and they
are now the most wretched of men, not because of the greatness of the danger, but on account
of the luxury in which hitherto they have lived! Many, at least when exhorted by us, and
counselled to sustain these adverse affairs with fortitude, said this, “We never practised any
thing of the kind, and do not know how to exercise such philosophy; this is why we need
so much consolation.”</p>
<p>5. Others again suppose, that to enjoy good health is the source of pleasure. But it is not
so. For many of those who enjoy good health have a thousand times wished themselves
dead, not being able to bear the insults inflicted on them. Others again affirm, that to enjoy
glory, and to have attained to power, and to administer the highest offices, and to be flattered
by multitudes, is productive of continual gladness. But neither is this the case. And why do
I speak of other offices of power? For although we were to mount up in thought to royalty
itself, and to him who lives in that station, we should find it encompassed with a diversity
of troubles, and having so many necessary causes the more of sadness, in proportion as it
is surrounded with a greater weight of affairs. And what need is there to speak of wars, and
battles, and the insurrections of barbarians? Oftentimes he has reason to fear those by whom
he is surrounded at home. For many of those monarchs who have escaped from the hands
of their enemies, have not escaped the conspiracies of their own body-guards. And kings
have of necessity as many causes of sadness as there are waves on the ocean. But if monarchy
is unable to render life devoid of grief, then what else can possibly achieve this? Nothing,
indeed, of this life; but this saying of Paul alone, brief and simple as it is, will of itself open
to us this treasure.</p>
<note type="footnote">1736 Proof of wealth.</note>

<pb n="680"/>
<p>6. For many words are not needed, nor a long round of argument, but if we only consider
his expression, we shall find the way that leads to it. He does not simply say, “Rejoice always;”
but he adds the cause of the continual pleasure, saying, “Rejoice in the Lord always.” He
who rejoices “in the Lord,” can not be deprived of the pleasure by any thing that may happen.
For all other things in which we rejoice are mutable and changeable, and subject to variation.
And not only does this grievous circumstance attend them, but moreover while they remain
they do not afford us a pleasure sufficient to repel and veil the sadness that comes upon us
from other quarters. But the fear of God contains both these requisites. It is steadfast and
immoveable, and sheds so much gladness that we can admit no sense of other evils. For the
man who fears God as he ought, and trusts in Him, gathers from the very root of pleasure,
and has possession of the whole fountain of cheerfulness. And as a spark falling upon a wide
ocean quickly disappears, so whatever events happen to the man who fears God, these,
falling as it were upon an immense ocean of joy, are quenched and destroyed! This indeed
is most to be wondered at, that whilst things which minister sadness are present, the man
should remain joyful. For if there was nothing to produce grief, it would be no great matter
to him that he was able continually to rejoice. But that at a time when he is urged to sadness
by the pressure of many things, he is superior to all these, and is blithe in the midst of sorrow,
this is truly a matter for astonishment! And as no one would have wondered that the three
Children were not burnt, if they had remained far off from the furnace of Babylon! (for the
circumstance that astonished all was, that having been so long in such close contact with
the fire, they left it more free from hurt than those who had not been in contact with it); so
also we are able to say of the saints, that if no temptation had fastened itself upon them, we
should not have wondered at their continual rejoicing. But the point worthy of admiration,
and that which surpasses human nature, is this, that being encircled on all sides with innumerable
waves, their condition is easier than that of those who enjoy an entire calm!</p>
<p>7. From what has been said, it is evident that amongst those who are outside the church
it is impossible to find any situation in life, encircled with continual gladness from the things
without. But that the believer cannot possibly be deprived of the enjoyment of a continued
pleasure is what I will now proceed to prove, to the end that ye may not only learn, but also
emulate this painless condition of life. For suppose a man having nothing for which to
condemn himself, but cherishing a good conscience, and yearning after the future state, and
the fulfilment of those good hopes; what, I ask, will be able to throw such a person into
sadness? Does not death seem the most insupportable of all things? Yet the expectation of
this is so far from grieving him, that it makes him the more joyful; for he knows that the
arrival of death is a release from labour, and a speeding toward the crowns and rewards laid
up for those who have contended in the race of piety and virtue. But is it the untimely end
of his children? Nay, he will also bear this nobly, and will take up the words of Job, “The
Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away; as it seemed good unto the Lord, so is it come to pass.

<pb n="681"/>
Blessed be the name of the Lord for ever.”1737 But if death and loss of children cannot grieve,
much less can the loss of money, or dishonour, or reproaches, or false accusations, at any
time affect a soul so great and noble; no, nor anguish of body, since the Apostles were
scourged, yet they were not made sad. This, indeed, was a great thing; but what is much
more, instead of being made sad, they considered their very scourgings, as a ground of additional
pleasure. “And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they
were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ.”1738 Did any person insult
and revile such a one? Well, he was taught by Christ to rejoice in these revilings. “Rejoice,”1739
saith He, “and be exceeding glad, when they shall say all manner of evil against you falsely
for my sake; for great is your reward in heaven.”1740 But suppose a man hath fallen into
disease? Well, he hath heard another admonishing, and saying, “In disease and poverty trust
thou in Him; for as gold is tried in the fire, so are acceptable men in the furnace of humiliation.”
1741 Since, therefore, neither death, nor loss of money, nor bodily disease, nor dishonour,
nor reproach, nor any other thing of that nature, will be able to grieve him, but makes
him even the more joyful, what foundation for sadness will he have at any time?</p>
<p>8. “What then,” says some one, “used not the Saint to be in sadness? Do you not hear
Paul saying, “I have great heaviness, and continual sorrow in my heart?”1742 This, indeed,
is the thing to wonder at, that sorrow brought a gain, and a pleasure that resulted from the
gain; for as the scourge did not procure them anguish, but gladness; so also again the sorrow
procured them those great crowns. And this is the paradox; that not only the sadness of the
world, but also its joy, contains extreme loss; but in the case of spiritual things, it is exactly
the reverse; and not the joy only, but the sadness too contains a rich treasure of good things!
But how, I proceed to explain. In the world, a person often rejoices, on beholding an enemy
in trouble; and by this joy he draws on himself a great punishment. Again, another person
mourns, on seeing a brother fall; and because of this sadness he will procure for himself
much favour with God. Seest thou how godly sorrow is better and more profitable than the
joy of the world? Thus also Paul sorrowed for sinners, and for those who disbelieved in God;
and this sorrow was the means of laying up a great reward for him. But that I may make
what I say more clear, and that ye may know that although what I assert is very strange, it
is nevertheless true, viz. that grief is often capable of refreshing distressed souls, and of
rendering a burdened conscience light: consider how often women, when they have lost

<pb n="682"/>
their most beloved children, break their hearts, and perish, if they are forbidden to mourn,
and to shed tears. But if they do all which those who are sad, are wont to do, they are relieved,
and receive consolation. And what wonder that this should be the case with women, when
you may even see a prophet affected in a similar manner? Therefore he was continually
saying, “Suffer me—I will weep bitterly—labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling
of the daughter of my people.”1743 So that, oftentimes, sadness is the bearer of consolation;
and if it is so with regard to this world. much more with regard to spiritual things. Therefore
he says, “Godly sorrow worketh repentance unto salvation, not to be repented of.”1744 This
indeed seems to be obscure; but what he says is to this effect: “If thou grievest over wealth,
thou art nothing profited. If for sickness, thou hast gained nothing, but hast increased thy
affliction.”</p>
<p>9. And I have heard many, after such experience, blame themselves, and say, What advantage
is it that I have grieved? I have not recovered my money, and I have injured myself.
But if thou hast grieved on account of sin, thou hast blotted it out, and hast reaped the
greatest pleasure. If thou hast grieved for thy brethren who have fallen, thou hast both encouraged
and comforted thyself, and hast also restored them; and even if thou wert not to
profit them, thou hast an abundant recompense. And that thou mayest learn that this
grieving for those who have fallen, though we should not at all benefit them, still brings us
a large reward, hear what Ezekiel says; or rather, what God Himself speaks through him.
For when He had sent certain messengers to overturn the city, and to consume all the
dwellings with sword and fire, along with their inhabitants, He thus charges one of them:
“Set a mark upon the forehead of the men that groan, and are in anguish.” And after charging
the others, and saying, “Begin ye from mine holy ones,” He goes on to add, “But upon
whomsoever the sign is, touch them not.”1745 For what reason, tell me? Because although
they avail nothing, they nevertheless lament the things which are done, and deplore them.
And again, He accuses others, saying, That in their luxury, and gluttony, and enjoyment of
great security, when they beheld the Jews carried away into captivity, they did not grieve,
nor partake of their sadness. And hear what He says, reproaching them: “They suffered
nothing in the affliction of Joseph:”1746 meaning by Joseph the whole people. And again:
“The inhabitants of Ænan went not forth to bewail the house next unto them.”1747 For although
they are justly punished, God willeth that we should condole with them, and not
rejoice or insult. “For if I that punish,” saith He, “do not this rejoicingly; nor take pleasure

<pb n="683"/>
in their punishment; for “I do not at all will the death of the sinner;”1748 it is right that thou
shouldest imitate thy Lord; and shouldest mourn for this very thing, that the sinner hath
provided matter and occasion for a just punishment.” So that if any one entertains a godly
sorrow, he will thence reap a great advantage.</p>
<p>10. Since therefore those who are scourged are more blessed than the scourgers, and
those in tribulation among us than those who are free from it outside the Christian pale;
and those who are sad are more blessed than those in pleasure; what further source of
tribulation shall we have? On this account we should call no man happy, save him only who
lives according to God. These only the Scripture terms blessed. For “blessed,” it is said, “is
the man who hath not walked in the counsel of the ungodly. Blessed is he whom Thou
chastenest, and teachest him out of Thy law. Blessed are the undefiled in the way. Blessed
are all they who trust in Him. Blessed is the people whose God is the Lord. Blessed is he
whom his soul condemneth not. Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord.”1749 And again,
Christ speaks thus: “Blessed are they that mourn; blessed are the humble; blessed are the
meek; blessed are the peacemakers; blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness’
sake.”1750 Seest thou how the divine laws everywhere pronounce blessed none of the rich,
or of the well-born, or of the possessors of glory, but the man who has gotten hold of virtue.
For what is required of us is, that in every thing we do or suffer, the fear of God should be
the foundation; and if you implant this as the root, not merely will ease, and honour, and
glory, and attention, produce fruits that shall be pleasurable to thee; but hostilities also, and
calumnies, and contempt, and disgrace, and torments, and all things without exception.
And just as the roots of trees are bitter in themselves, and yet produce our sweetest fruits,
so, verily, godly sorrow will bring us an abundant pleasure. They know, who have often
prayed with anguish, and shed tears, what gladness they have reaped; how they purged the
conscience; how they rose up with favourable hopes! For as I am always saying, it is not the
nature of the things, but our disposition, which is wont to make us sad or joyful. If then we
can render the latter such as it ought to be, we shall have a pledge for all gladness. And just
as, with the body, it is not so much the nature of the air, or the things it meets from without,
as its own internal condition, that either injures or assists it, so also it is in the case of the
soul; and much more so; for in the one case, there is the necessity of nature; in the other,
the whole is seated in the power of choice. Therefore Paul, when he had endured innumerable
evils—shipwrecks, wars, persecutions, plots, the assaults of robbers, and things too numerous
<note type="footnote">1748 Ezek. xviii. 32.</note>

<pb n="684"/>
to be recounted, dying also daily deaths—was so far from grieving or being discontented,
that he gloried, and rejoiced, and said, “I now rejoice in my sufferings, and fill up that which
is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.”1751 And again: “And not only so, but we
glory in tribulations.”1752 Now, glorying signifies an extension of pleasure.</p>
<p>11. If then thou desirest joy, seek not after riches, nor bodily health, nor glory, nor
power, nor luxury, nor sumptuous tables, nor vestures of silk, nor costly lands, nor houses
splendid and conspicuous, nor any thing else of that kind; but pursue that spiritual wisdom
which is according to God, and take hold of virtue; and then nought of the things which are
present, or which are expected, will be able to sadden thee. Why do I say to sadden? Verily,
the things that make others sad, will prove to thee an accession of pleasure. For scourges,
and death, and losses, and slanders, and the being evil entreated, and all such things, when
they are brought upon us for God’s sake, and spring from this root, will bring into our souls
much pleasure. For no one will be able to make us miserable, if we do not make ourselves
such; nor, on the other hand, blessed, if we do not make ourselves such, following up the
grace of God.</p>
<p>12. And that ye may learn that he only is blessed, who feareth the Lord, I will now
demonstrate this to you, not by what has happened in past times, but by what has befallen
ourselves. Our city was in danger of being utterly effaced; and no man among the rich, or
eminent, or illustrious, dared to appear in public, but all fled, and hurried out of the way.
But they who feared God, the men who passed their time in monasteries, hastened down
with much boldness, and set all free from this terror; and the terrible events that had taken
place, and the threats which had been expected to be put into execution, were so far from
causing them to fear, or from throwing them into anxiety, that although they were placed
far off from the calamity, and had no share in it, they cast themselves willingly into the midst
of the fire, and rescued all; and as for death, which seems universally terrible and awful, they
awaited it with the utmost readiness, and ran to meet it with more pleasure than others do
towards principalities and honours. And why, but because they knew, that this is the greatest
principality and honour? And they shewed in very deed that he only is blessed who lays
hold of the wisdom which is from above, that he undergoes no change and sustains no adversity,
but enjoys a continued tranquillity, and laughs to scorn all things which seem to be
sorrowful. At the present time at least, those who were once in power are oppressed by much
sadness, inhabiting the prison, and loaded with chains, and daily expecting to be put to
death. But these men on the contrary enjoy the purest pleasure; and if it be their lot to suffer
anything terrible, this, and the very things which seem formidable to others, are welcome
to them, for they know well towards what point they are running, and what lot will await
<note type="footnote">1751 Coloss. i. 24.</note>

<pb n="685"/>
them when they depart hence. But whilst they live with so much exactness, and smile at
death, they nevertheless grieve for others, and reap therefrom, in turn, the greatest advantage.
Let us then be in earnest to take care of our souls, and nothing which may come unlooked
for can make us sad. And on behalf of those who are in prison, let us beseech God that He
will deliver them from their present calamity. For it was in God’s power at once to release
us from this dire evil, and not to suffer even the smallest part of it to remain; but in order
that we may not again go back to our former negligence, He hath provided that the torrent
of these evils should subside gently and by little and little, holding us fast to the same pious
resolutions.</p>
<p>13. And that this is true, and that many would have gone back to their former supineness,
if we had been released from the whole difficulty at once, is manifest from this circumstance;
that whilst yet the remnants of the calamity are left, whilst the sentence of the Emperor is
yet doubtful, and those who conducted the affairs of the city are all in prison,1753 many of
our fellow inhabitants, through their inordinate desire of bathing, run to the river, there
making endless merriment, behaving wantonly, leaping, dancing, and dragging women after
them. What pardon can such be worthy of? What kind of excuse can they offer? Or rather,
what kind of punishment and vengeance do they not deserve? The head of the city is in the
public prison; our members are in exile; the sentence concerning them is doubtful; and dost
thou, I ask, dance, sport, and laugh? “Why, we could not endure,” says some one, “to remain
without the bath?” O shameless disposition, sordid and perverted! How many months, I
ask, how many years, have past? Thou hast not been as yet shut out from the bath for twenty
days; and thou art as much distressed and discontented, as if thou hadst continued without
washing for a whole year! Tell me, was this thy state, when thou wert expecting an attack
from the military, when thou wert daily anticipating bring put to death, when thou fleddest
to the deserts, and wast hurrying to the mountain tops? If any one had then proposed to
thee to remain “a year” without the bath, so that thou mightest be rescued from the impending
distress, wouldest thou not readily have accepted the proposal, and submitted to it?
When, therefore, it were becoming that thou shouldest give thanks to God, Who hath freed
thee from all these things without any loss, dost thou again grow wanton and contemptuous;
and when the fear has passed away, turn back afresh to a worse state of negligence? Have
these dire events really touched thee, and yet art thou so desirous of the baths? Why, if the
bath had been permitted, would not the calamity of those who are yet in confinement have
been sufficient to persuade those who are not in the same grievous condition to be forgetful
of every luxury? Life itself is at stake, and dost thou remember the baths, and desire to be
luxurious? Dost thou despise the danger because thou hast now escaped it? Take heed lest
thou entangle thyself in the necessity of a greater punishment, and call back in larger

measure the wrath which is removed, and experience the very thing which Christ declared
concerning the devils. For He says, that “when the unclean spirit is gone out, and afterwards
findeth the house void and swept, he taketh seven other spirits more wicked than himself,
and entereth into the soul, and the last state of that man is worse than the first.”1754 Therefore
let us also fear, lest now we are liberated from our former evils, we afterwards by our listlessness
draw upon us those which are greater! I know that ye yourselves1755 are free from this
folly; but ye should restrain, punish, and sober those who walk disorderly, that ye may always
rejoice even as Paul commanded, that both for our own good works, and for our forethought
for others, we may enjoy both here and in the life to come an abundant recompense; through
the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, by Whom, and with Whom, to the
Father, with the Holy Ghost, be glory, honour, and adoration, now and ever, and world
without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XIX.</head>
<p>On the Sunday called “Episozomenes,”1756 to those who had come to Antioch from the country—
also on the subject of avoiding oaths.</p>
<p>1. Ye have revelled during the last few days in the Holy Martyrs! Ye have taken your fill
of the spiritual feast! Ye have all exulted with honest exultation! Ye have beheld their ribs
laid bare, and their loins lacerated; the blood flowing forth all around; ten thousand forms
of torture! Ye have seen human nature exhibiting that which is above nature, and crowns
woven with blood! Ye have danced a goodly dance throughout the whole city; this, your
noble captain1757 leading you on; but sickness compelled me to remain at home, although
against my will. But if I did not take a part in the festival, I partook of the pleasure of it. If I
could not have the enjoyment of your public assembly, yet did I share in your gladness. For
such is the power of love, that it makes those who are not actually in the enjoyment to rejoice
equally with those who are; persuading them to think the good things of their neighbour
common to themselves. Therefore even whilst I sat at home, I was rejoicing with you; and
now whilst I am not yet entirely freed from my sickness, I have risen up, and run to meet
you, that I may see your much desired faces, and take a part in the present festival.</p>
<p>2. For I think the present day to be a very great festival indeed on account of our brethren,
who by their presence beautify our city, and adorn the Church; a people foreign to us in
language,1758 but in harmony with us concerning the faith, a people passing their time in
tranquillity, and leading an honest and sober life. For among these men there are no spectacles
of iniquity—no horse racings, nor harlots, nor any of that riot which pertains to a city, but
every kind of licentiousness is banished, and great sobriety flourishes every where. And the
reason is, that their life is a laborious one; and they have, in the culture of the soil, a school
of virtue and sobriety, and follow that art which God introduced before all others into our
life. For before the sin of Adam, when he enjoyed much freedom, a certain tillage of the
ground was enjoined upon him; not indeed a laborious or a troublesome one, but one which
afforded him much good discipline, for he was appointed, it is said, “to till the garden, and
to keep it.” Each of these men you may see at one time employed in yoking the labouring
oxen, and guiding the plough, and cutting the deep furrow; and at another ascending the

sacred pulpit,1759 and cultivating the souls of those under their authority; at one time cutting
away the thorns from the soil with a bill-hook, at another purging out the sins of the soul
by the Word. For they are not ashamed of work like the inhabitants of our city, but they are
ashamed of idleness, knowing that this has taught every kind of wickedness; and that to
those who love it, it has proved a teacher of iniquity from the beginning.</p>
<p>3. These are our philosophers, and theirs the best philosophy, exhibiting their virtue
not by their outward appearance, but by their mind. The pagan philosophers are in character
no wise better than those who are engaged on the stage, and in the sports of actors; and they
have nothing to shew beyond the threadbare cloak, the beard, and the long robe! But these,
quite on the contrary, bidding farewell to staff and beard, and the other accoutrements, have
their souls adorned with the doctrines of the true philosophy, and not only with the doctrines,
but also with the real practice. And were you to question any one of these, who live a rustic
life at the spade and plough, as to the dogmas respecting which the pagan philosophers have
discoursed an infinite deal, and have expended a multitude of words, without being able to
say any thing sound; one of these would give you an accurate reply from his store of wisdom.
And not only is this to be wondered at, but that they confirm the credibility of these doctrines
by their actions. For of the fact that we have an immortal soul, and that we shall hereafter
render an account of what we have done here, and stand before a fearful Tribunal, their
minds are at once thoroughly persuaded, and they have also regulated their whole course
of life by such hopes as these; and have become superior to all worldly show, instructed as
they have been by the sacred Scriptures, that “all is vanity, yea, vanity of vanities,”1760 and
they do not greedily long for any of those things which seem to be so splendid.</p>
<p>4. These too know how to philosophize concerning God, even as God hath determined;
and if, taking one of them, you were now to bring forward some pagan philosopher;—or
rather, now you could not find one!1761—But if you were to take one of these, and then
open the books of their ancient philosophers, and go through them, and institute an enquiry
by way of parallel as to what these now answer, and the others in their day philosophically
advanced; you would see how much wisdom belonged to the former, and how much folly
to the latter. For whilst some of those would aver, that the things existing were destitute of
a providence, and that the creation had not its origin from God; that virtue was not sufficient
for itself, but stood in need of wealth, and nobility, and external splendour, and other things
still more ridiculous; and whilst these, on the other hand, would discourse wisely respecting

Providence, respecting the future Tribunals of judgment, respecting the creative power of
God, bringing forth all things out of nothing, as well as respecting all other points, although
at the same time they were entirely destitute of worldly schooling; who could but learn from
hence the power of Christ, which hath proved these unlearned and simple persons to be as
much wiser than those, who make so much boast of their wisdom, as men of discretion are
seen to be in comparison of little children? For what harm can result to them from their
simplicity in regard to learning, when their thoughts are full of much wisdom? And what
advantage have those philosophers from this learning, when the understanding is devoid
of right thoughts? It were just as if one should have a sword that had its hilt of silver, whilst
the blade was weaker than the vilest lead. For truly these philosophers have their tongue
decked out with words and names, but their understanding is full of mere weakness and
good for nothing. Not so with these philosophers, but quite the reverse. Their understanding
is full of spiritual wisdom1762 and their mode of life is a transcript of their doctrines. Amongst
these there are no luxurious women; there are no ornaments of dress, nor colours, nor
paints; but all such corruption of manners is discountenanced. Hence the population under
their charge are the more readily trained to sobriety, and the law which Paul gave, when he
directed that food and covering should be had, and nothing more be sought after, they most
rigidly observe.1763 Amongst them, there are no perfumed unguents to fascinate the
senses;1764 but the earth bringing forth herbs, prepares for them a varied fragrance of flowers,
above all the skill of perfumers. For this reason, their bodies as well as souls enjoy a sound
state of health, inasmuch as they have banished all luxury of diet, and driven off all the evil
floods of drunkenness; and they eat just as much as suffices for subsistence. Let us then not
despise them because of their outward appearance, but let us admire their mind. For of what
advantage is the external habit, when the soul is more wretchedly clad than any beggar! The
man ought to be praised and admired, not for dress, nay more, not for his bodily form, but
for his soul. Lay bare the soul of these men, and you will see its beauty and the wealth it
possesses, in their words, in their doctrines, and in the whole system of their manners!</p>
<p>5. Let the Gentiles then be ashamed, let them hide their heads, and slink away on account
of their philosophers, and their wisdom, wretched as it is beyond all folly! For the philosophers
that have been amongst them in their lifetime have hardly been able to teach their doctrines
to a very few, who can easily be numbered; and when any trifling peril overtook them,
they lost even these. But the disciples of Christ, the fishermen, the publicans, and the tentmakers,
in a few years brought over the whole world to the truth; and when from that time,
ten thousand perils have been constantly arising, the preaching of the Gospel was so far

from being put down, that it still flourishes and increases; and they taught simple people,
tillers of the ground, and occupied with cattle, to be lovers of wisdom. Such are the persons,
who beside all the rest having deeply rooted in them that love which is the source of all good
things,1765 have hastened to us, undertaking so long a journey, that they might come and
embrace their fellow-members.</p>
<p>6. Come then, and in return for these favours, (I speak of their love and kind feeling),
let us give them a provision, and so send them home; and let us again raise the question
concerning oaths; that from the minds of all we may pluck up by the roots this evil custom.
But first, I desire to put you a little in mind to-day of the things we spoke of lately.1766
When the Jews, having been released from Persia, and set free from that tyranny, were
returned back to their own county, “I saw,” saith one, “a flying sickle, twenty cubits in length,
and ten cubits broad.”1767 They heard also the Prophet giving them this instruction, “This
is the curse, that goeth forth over the face of the whole land, and entereth into the house of
him that sweareth falsely; and it shall rest in the midst thereof, and throw down the timber
and all the stones.” When we had read this passage, we also enquired then why it was, that
it should destroy not the swearer only, but also his house, and we stated this to be the reason;
that God will have the punishments of the most grievous sins to remain continually visible;
that all may afterwards learn prudence. Inasmuch then as it was necessary that the perjurer
when dead should be buried, and committed to the bosom of the earth; in order that his
wickedness might not be buried along with him, his house was made a heap, so that all who
passed by, beholding it, and learning the reason of the overthrow, might avoid imitating
the sin.</p>
<p>7. This also happened at Sodom. For when they burned in their lust one towards another,
then too the very earth itself was burned up, being kindled by the fire from above. For He
designed, that the vengeance of this sin should permanently remain.</p>
<p>And observe the mercy of God! Those who had sinned, He caused not to continue
burning to the present day, but when they had been for once in flames, He buried them;
and burning up the face of the ground, He placed it visibly before all who after should desire
to look at these things; and now the sight of the land, through all the generations since, hath
given an admonition beyond all powers of speech, crying out as it were, and saying, “Dare
not to do the deeds of Sodom, lest ye suffer the lot of Sodom!” For precept commonly makes
not so deep an impression upon the mind as a fearful spectacle does, which bears upon it

the vestiges of calamity though all time. And persons that have visited these places bear
witness, who often, when they hear the Scripture discoursing of these things, are not much
terrified; but when they have gone and stood upon the site, and see the whole surface of it
disfigured, and have witnessed the effects of the fire, with soil no where visible, but every
thing dust and ashes, they come away astonished with the sight, and taking with them a
strong lesson of chastity. For truly, the very nature of the punishment was a pattern of the
nature of the sin! Even as they devised a barren intercourse, not having for its end the procreation
of children, so did God bring on them such a punishment, as made the womb of
the land ever barren, and destitute of all fruits! For this reason also He threatened to destroy
the dwellings of the swearers, in order that by their punishments, they may make others to
be more self-controlled.</p>
<p>8. But I am ready to shew to-day, not the destruction of one, two, or three houses in
consequence of oaths, but that of a whole city and of a people beloved of God; of a nation
that had always enjoyed much of the divine care; and of a race that had escaped many
dangers.1768 For Jerusalem herself, the city of God, which had the holy ark, and all that divine
service;—where there were once prophets, and the grace of the Spirit, and the ark; and the
tables of the covenant, and the golden pot;—where angels were frequent visitors;—this city,
I say, when a multitude of wars took place, and many foreign nations made attacks upon it,
as if girt by a wall of adamant, ever laughed them all to scorn, and whilst the land was utterly
destroyed, sustained no injury! And not only is this to be wondered at, but that frequently
in driving out its enemies, it inflicted upon them a heavy blow, and enjoyed so much of the
providential care of God, that God Himself said, “I found Israel as a bunch of grapes in the
desert; and I beheld your fathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree.”1769 And again, of the
city itself: “As olive berries on the extremity of the highest bough, and they shall say, Do
them no harm.”1770 Nevertheless, the city beloved of God; that had escaped so many perils;
that had been favoured with pardon, amidst the multitude of its sins; that alone had been
able to avoid captivity, whilst all the rest were carried away, not once or twice, but very often;
was ruined solely by an oath. But how, I proceed to state.</p>
<p>9. One of their kings was Zedekiah. This Zedekiah took an oath to Nebuchadnezzar,
king of the barbarians, that he would remain in alliance with him. Afterwards he revolted,
and went over to the king of Egypt, disdaining the obligation of his oath, and suffered the
things of which ye shall hear presently. But first, it is necessary to mention the parable of
the prophet, in which he enigmatically represented all these matters: “The word of the Lord,”
<note type="footnote">1768 St. Chrysostom here carries on the argument against the use of oaths, which he had broken off in Homily

saith he, “came to me, saying, Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable, and say,
Thus saith the Lord God: A great eagle, with great wings, and long extended, full of claws.”1771
Here he calls the king of the Babylonians an eagle, and speaks of him as being “great, and
long-winged;” and he calls him long-extended and “full of claws,” on account of the multitude
of his army, and the greatness of his power, and the swiftness of his invasion. For just as the
wings and claws of the eagle are his armour, so are horses and soldiers to kings. This eagle,
he goes on to say, “hath the leading1772 to enter into Lebanon.” What is meant by the
“leading?” Counsel—design. And Judæa is called Lebanon, because of its situation near that
mountain. Afterwards, intending to speak of the oaths and treaties, “He took,” saith he, “of
the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful field, that it might take root by great waters.
He placed it to be looked upon; and it grew, and became a weak vine, and of small stature,
and it stretched out its branches towards him, and its roots were under him.”1773 Here he
calls the city of Jerusalem1774 a vine; but in saying that it stretched out its branches towards
the eagle, and that its roots were under him, he refers to the treaties and alliances made with
him; and that it cast itself upon him. Next, purposing to declare the iniquity of this, he saith,
“And there was another great eagle,” (speaking of the Egyptian king), “with great wings,
and having many claws;1775 and the vine did bend itself toward him, and its tendril toward
him, and shot out its branches, that it might be watered. Therefore, I said, Thus saith the
Lord God: Shall it prosper?”1776 That is to say, “after having broken the oath, and the
treaties, shall it be able to remain, or to be safe, or to avoid falling?” Presently, for the purpose
of shewing that this is not to happen, but that it is certainly to be destroyed on account of
the oath, he discourses concerning its punishment, and alleges the cause. “For its tender
roots and its fruits shall become corrupt, and all which springs therefrom shall be
withered.”1777 And for the purpose of shewing that it will not be destroyed by human
strength, but because it hath made God its enemy by means of these oaths, he subjoins, “Not
by a mighty arm, nor by much people, to pluck it up by its roots.” Such indeed is the parable,
but the prophet again explains it, when he says, “Behold, the king of Babylon cometh against
Jerusalem.”1778 And then, after saying some other things between, he mentions the oaths

and the treaties. “For” saith he, “he shall make a covenant with him;”1779 and presently,
speaking of the departure from it, he goes on to say, “And he will depart from him, by
sending messengers into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people.” And
then he proceeds to shew that it is on account of the oath that all this destruction is to take
place. “Surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, he who hath despised
My curse, and hath transgressed My covenant, in the midst of Babylon he shall die; and not
by great power nor by multitude, because he despised the oath in transgressing this My
covenant; I will surely recompense upon his own head this My oath which he hath dishonoured,
and My covenant which he hath broken; and I will spread My net upon him.”1780
Seest thou, that not once, or twice, but repeatedly, it is said that because of the oath he was
to suffer all these things. For God is inexorable when oaths are treated contemptuously. Nor
merely from the punishment which was brought upon the city by the oath, but also from
the delay, and the postponement, may it be seen how much God is concerned for the inviolability
of oaths. “For it came to pass,” we are told, “in the ninth year of the reign of
Zedekiah, on the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came,
and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built a wall against it round
about, and the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king Zedekiah, and the ninth day
of the month,1781 and there was no bread for the people to eat, and the city was broken
up.”1782 He might indeed, at once from the first day, have delivered them up, and have
given them into the hands of their enemies; but He permitted that they should first be wasted
for the space of three years, and experience a most distressing siege; to the end that during
this interval, being humbled by the terror of the forces without, or the famine that oppressed
the city within, they might compel the king, however unwillingly, to submit to the barbarian;
and some alleviation might be obtained for the sin committed. And to prove that this is
true, and no conjecture of my own, hear what He saith to him by the prophet: “If thou shalt
go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be
burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house. But if thou wilt not go forth to the
king of Babylon’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans; and
they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand. And the king said,
I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hands
and they mock me. But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the
word of the Lord, which I speak unto thee; so shall it be better for thee, and thy soul shall
live. But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the Lord hath shewed me. All the

women that are left in the king of Judah’s house, shall be brought forth to the king of
Babylon’s princes; and those shall say, The men who are at peace with thee have deceived
thee, and have prevailed over thee; they shall prevail when thy feet slip; they are turned away
from thee, and they shall bring out all thy wives, and thy children to the Chaldeans, and
thou shalt not escape out of their hand, for thou shalt be taken by the hand of the king of
Babylon, and this city shall be burned with fire.”1783</p>
<p>10. But when He did not prevail with him by this address, but he remained in his sin
and transgression, after three years, God delivered up the city, displaying at once His own
clemency and the ingratitude of that king. And entering in with the utmost ease, they “burnt
the house of the Lord, and the king’s house, and the houses of Jerusalem, and every great
house, the captain of the guard1784 burnt, and overthrew the wall of Jerusalem;”1785 and
everywhere there was the fire of the barbarian, the oath being the conductor of the conflagration,
and carrying about the flame in all directions. “And the captain of the guard carried
away the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the fugitives that fell away to the
king of Babylon.1786 And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the Lord the Chaldeans
brake up, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the Lord, did the Chaldees
break in pieces. And the pots, and the flesh-hooks, and the bowls, and the censers, and all
the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away. And the firepans, and all
the golden and silver bowls they took away. Moreover, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the
guard, took away the two pillars, and the bases, and the sea which Solomon had made in
the house of the Lord. And they took away Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second
priest, and the three keepers of the door; and out of the city one eunuch that was set over
the men of war; and five men that were in the king’s presence; and Shaphan the chief captain,
and the principal scribe, and threescore men. And he took these, and brought them to the
king of Babylon, and the king smote them, and slew them.”1787</p>
<p>11. Be mindful therefore, I pray, now of the “flying sickle” that “resteth in the swearer’s
house;” and “destroyeth the walls and the timber and the stones.” Be mindful, I pray, how
this oath entered into the city, and overturned houses, and temple, and walls, and splendid
buildings, and made the city an heap; and that neither the Holy of Holies, nor the sacred
vessels, nor any thing else could ward off that punishment and vengeance, for that the oath
had been transgressed! The city, indeed, was thus miserably destroyed. But the king endured
what was still more wretched and deplorable.1788 And as the flying sickle overthrew the

Chaldeans pursued after the king and overtook him, and they took the king, and brought
him to the king of Babylon, and the king of Babylon gave judgment1789 upon Zedekiah, and
slew his sons before his face, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters,
and carried him to Babylon.” What is meant by the expression, “he spake judgment with
him?” He demanded of him an account of his conduct, he pleaded against him; and first he
slew his two sons, that he might be a spectator of the calamity of his house, and might behold1790
that deplorable tragedy; and then he put out his own eyes. For what reason, I ask
again, did this occur? In order that he might go as a teacher to the barbarians, and too the
Jews who dwelt among them; and that they who had eyes might discern by him who was
bereft of sight, how great an evil is an oath! Nor only these; but all who dwelt by the way,
beholding the man fettered and blinded, might learn by his calamity the greatness of his
sin. Therefore one of the prophets declares, “He shall not see Babylon.”1791 And another,
“He shall be carried away to Babylon.”1792 And the prophecy seems, indeed, to be contradictory.
But it is not so; for both of these are true. For he saw not Babylon, though he was
carried away to Babylon. How then did he not see Babylon? Because it was in Judæa he had
his eyes put out; for where the oath had been set at nought, there also was it vindicated, and
he himself subjected to punishment. And how was he carried away to Babylon? In a state
of captivity. For since the punishment was twofold, deprivation of sight and captivity, the
prophets took them severally. The one saith, “He shall not see Babylon,” speaking of the
loss of his eyes; the other saith, “He shall be carried away to Babylon,” signifying his captivity.</p>
<p>12. Knowing these things, then, brethren, and gathering up what has been now advanced,
as well as what has been said before; let us at last desist from this evil custom, yea, I pray
and beseech you all! For if in the old dispensation, when the Jews had not the strictest
moral wisdom required of them, but much condescension was extended to them, such wrath
was the effect of one oath; such capture and captivity; what punishment is it likely that those
who swear should now be subjected to, after an express law forbidding the practice, and so
large an addition of precepts. Is it, indeed, all that is required, that we come to the assembly,
and hear what is spoken? Why truly it is a reason for greater condemnation, and for more
inevitable punishment, that we are continually hearing, and yet do not what is bidden! What
excuse shall we have, or what pardon, if assembling here from earliest youth to latest old
age, and enjoying the advantage of so much instruction, we remain just like them, and do

not take pains to correct a single defect. Let no one henceforth allege custom. For this is the
very thing at which I am indignant and provoked, that we are not able to get the better of
custom. And, pray, if we do not get the better of custom, how can we get the better of concupiscence,
which hath its root even in the principles of our nature; for it is natural to feel
desire; but to desire wickedly, comes after of choice. But this practice of swearing takes not
even its first principle from nature,1793 but from mere negligence.</p>
<p>13. And that thou mayest learn that not from the difficulty of the thing, but through
our inattention, this sin has advanced to such a pitch, let us call to mind how many things
far more difficult than these, men accomplish; and that too without expecting any recompense
therefrom. Let us think what services the Devil imposes; how laborious, how troublesome
they are; and yet, the difficulty has not become an obstacle to these services. For what can
be more difficult, I ask, than when any young person delivering himself up to those, who
undertake to make his limbs supple and pliant, uses his most strenuous exertion to bend
his whole body into the exact shape of a wheel, and to turn over upon the pavement; his
powers being tasked at the same time through the eyes, and through the movement of the
hands, as well as other convolutions for the purpose of being transformed into the likeness
of woman-kind.1794 Yet neither the difficulty of these feats, nor the degradation arising
from them, are thought of. And again, those who are dragged upon the dancing-stage, and
use the members of the body as though they were wings, who that beholds them can help
being struck with wonder? So too they who toss knives aloft in the air one after another,
and catch them all by the handle, whom might they not put to shame of those who refuse
to undergo any labour for the sake of virtue? And what can any one say of those men, who
balancing a pole on the forehead, keep it just as steady as a tree rooted in the ground? And
this is not the only marvellous part of the affair but that they set little children to wrestle
with one another on the top of the tree; and neither the hands, nor any other part of the
body assisting, the forehead alone sustains the pole unshaken, and with more steadiness
than any kind of fastening. Again: another walks on the slenderest rope, with the same
fearlessness as men do when they run over level plains. Nevertheless these things, which
even in thought seem impracticable, have become possible by art. What like this have we,
<note type="footnote">1793 This is the reading in some mss. adopted by Savile, but the Benedictine readsἐκ τῆς τροαιρ›σεως “from
moral choice,” or “purpose,” i.e., aiming at something supposed to be good.</note>

backwards, bent into the form of a wheel,” and “reading and writing while whirled on a potter’s wheel,”U+0026c. (on
which Socrates takes occasion to say how much women might learn). Wilkinson observes, that this bears some
resemblance to a feat indicated in Egyptian paintings, not less than 1300 years before the age of Socrates. See
Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians, vol. ii. p. 415. Of the degradation attached to such feats, see

I ask, to allege concerning oaths? What kind of difficulty? what toil? what art? what danger?
There is only needed on our part a little earnestness, and the whole of our task will be quickly
performed.</p>
<p>14. And do not tell me, “I have accomplished the greater part of it;” but if thou hast not
accomplished the whole, consider that thou hast not as yet done any thing; for this little, if
neglected, is destruction to all the rest. Often indeed when men have built a house, and put
on the roof, they have destroyed the whole fabric, by not making any concern of a single
tile that has been shaken off from it. And one may see the same thing occur with respect to
garments; for there too if a small hole is made, and not repaired, a large rent is the consequence.
And this also is frequently the case in regard to floods; for these, if they find but
a small entrance, let in the whole torrent. Thou also, then, even if thou hast fortified thyself
all around, and but a small part be left still unfortified, yet block up this also against the
devil, that thou mayest be made strong on all sides! Thou hast seen the sickle! Thou hast
seen the head of John! Thou hast heard the history pertaining to Saul! Thou hast heard the
manner of the Jewish captivity! And beside all these, thou hast heard the sentence of Christ
declaring, that not only to commit perjury, but to swear in any way, is a diabolical thing,
and the whole a device of the evil one.1795 Thou hast heard that every where perjuries follow
oaths. Putting all these things then together, write them upon thy understanding. Dost thou
not see how women and little children suspend Gospels1796 from their necks as a powerful
amulet, and carry them about in all places wherever they go. Thus do thou write the commands
of the Gospel and its laws upon thy mind. Here there is no need of gold or property,
or of buying a book; but of the will only, and the affections of the soul awakened, and the
Gospel will be thy surer guardian, carrying it as thou wilt then do, not outside, but treasured
<note type="footnote">1795 So cometh of evil may be understood. St. Chrysostom scarcely allows an oath in any case, unless perhaps
as quoted on Eph. i. 14. His words are sometimes marked as caute legenda. Other Fathers, and the usual practice,
allowed them on just occasions. See Bingham, xvi. c. vii. sec. 4. Where, however, St. Athanasius uses a qualified
form of putting an oath. See also his Comment on Ps. lxiii. 11, he speaks almost as strongly as St. Chrysostom,
as does also St. Basil, still using himself an affirmation before God, and discussing questions of obligation by
oath.</note>

says, b. xvi. c. v. sec. 6, that he, and St. Basil, and St. Epiphanius, complain of it, but the passages he quotes do
not do so. St. Chrys. tolerates this, seemingly, but expressly denies its efficacy as a mere charm. On the use of
charms he is severe, though used by Christians, and containing nothing of decidedly heathenish import. He
considers making the sign of the cross as opposed to these, and an act of faith. See on Ep. to Col. Hom. VIII.

up within; yea, in the soul’s secret chambers. When thou risest up then from thy bed, and
when thou goest out of thine house, repeat this law: “I say unto you, Swear not at all.”1797
And the saying will be to thee a discipline; for there is no need of much labour, but only of
a moderate degree of attention. And that this is true, may thus be proved. Call thy son, and
frighten him, and threaten to lay a few stripes upon him, if he does not duly observe this
law; and thou wilt see, how he will forthwith abstain from this custom. Is it not therefore
truly absurd, that little children, out of the fear we inspire, should perform this commandment,
and that we should not fear God as our sons fear us?</p>
<p>15. What then I said before this, I now again repeat. Let us lay down a law for ourselves
in this matter; not to meddle either with public or private affairs until we have fulfilled this
law; and then surely under the pressure of this obligation we shall easily conquer, and we
shall at once adorn ourselves, and decorate our city. For consider what a thing it would be
to have it said every where throughout the world, “A practice becoming Christians is established
at Antioch, and you will hear no one giving utterance to an oath, even though the
greatest necessity is laid upon him!” This is what the neighbouring cities will certainly hear;
nay, not the neighbouring cities only, but even to the ends of the earth will the report be
conveyed. For it is indeed probable that both the merchants who mix with you, and others
who arrive from this place, will report all these matters. When, therefore, many persons in
the way of encomium mention the harbours of other cities, or the markets, or the abundance
of wares, enable those who come from hence to say, that there is that at Antioch, which is
to be seen in no other city; for that the men who dwell there would sooner have their tongues
cut out, than suffer an oath to proceed from their mouths! This will be your ornament and
defence, and not only so, but it will bring an abundant reward. For others also will certainly
emulate, and imitate you. But if, when a person has gained but one or two,1798 he shall receive
so great a reward from God; what recompense shall ye not receive when ye are the instructors
of the whole world. It is your duty then to bestir yourselves, to be watchful, and to be sober;
knowing that not only from our own personal good works, but from those we have also
wrought in others, shall we receive the best recompense, and enjoy much favour with God,
which may He grant us all continually to enjoy, and hereafter to obtain the kingdom of
heaven, in Christ Jesus our Lord; to Whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, be glory
and power both now and ever, and world without end. Amen.</p>

<head>Homily XX.1799</head>
<p>That the fast of Lent is not sufficient to make us competent to partake of the Communion, but
that holiness is the first thing required. How it is possible not to entertain resentment, and
that God takes much account of this law; and that the entertaining of resentment punishes
those who are guilty of it even before they reach the place of torment.—Also concerning
abstinence from oaths, and those who have not succeeded in abstaining from swearing.</p>
<p>1. At length the season is verging towards the end of the Fast, and therefore we ought
the more earnestly to devote ourselves to holiness. For as in the case of those who run a
race, all their circuits will be of no avail if they miss the prize; so neither will any advantage
result from these manifold labours and toils with regard to the fast, if we are not able to
enjoy the sacred Table with a good conscience. For this end are fasting and Lent appointed,
and so many days of solemn assemblies, auditories, prayers, and teachings, in order that by
this earnestness1800 being cleansed in every possible way from the sins which we had contracted
during the whole year, we may with spiritual boldness religiously partake of that
unbloody Sacrifice; so that should this not be the result, we shall have sustained so much
labour entirely in vain, and without any profit. Let every one, therefore, consider with
himself what defect he hath corrected, what good work he hath attained to; what sin he hath
cast off, what stain he hath purged away; in what respect he has become better. And should
he discover that in this good traffic he has made any gain by the fast, and be conscious in
himself of much care taken of his wounds, let him draw near! But if he hath remained negligent,
having nothing to shew but mere fasting, and hath done nothing which is right besides,
let him remain outside;1801 and then let him enter, when he hath purged out all these offences.
Let no one rest on the fast merely; whilst continuing unreformed in evil practices. For it is
probable, that he who omits fasting may obtain pardon, having infirmity of body to plead;
but it is impossible that he can have an excuse who hath not amended his faults. Thou hast
not fasted, it may be, on account of bodily weakness. Tell me for what reason thou art not
reconciled to thine enemies? Hast thou, indeed, here to allege bodily infirmity? Again; if
thou retainest envy and hatred, what apology hast thou then I ask? For no one in offences

of this kind is able to take refuge in the plea of bodily infirmity. And this was a work of
Christ’s1802 love toward man, viz. that the chief of the precepts, and those which maintain
our life, should not be impaired in any degree through the weakness of the body.</p>
<p>2. But since we need to practise all the divine laws alike, and more especially that which
bids us consider no man as an enemy, nor retain resentment long, but forthwith to be reconciled;
suffer us to-day to discourse to you concerning this commandment. For as it is not
to be imagined that the fornicator and the blasphemer can partake of the sacred Table, so
it is impossible that he who hath an enemy, and bears malice, can enjoy the holy Communion.
And this with good reason. For a man when he has committed fornication, or adultery, at
the same time that he hath accomplished his lust, hath also completed the sin; and should
he be willing by watchful living to recover from that fall, he may afterwards, by manifesting
great penitence, obtain some relief. But he who is resentful worketh the same iniquity every
day, and never brings it to an end. In the former case the deed is over, and the sin completed;
but here the sin is perpetrated every day. What excuse can we then have, I ask, for delivering
ourselves willingly to such an evil monster? How canst thou ask thy Lord to be mild and
merciful to thee, when thou hast been so hard and unforgiving to thy fellow-servant?</p>
<p>3. But thy fellow-servant hath treated thee with contempt perhaps? Yes! and thou hast
treated God with contempt oftentimes. And what comparison is there between a fellowservant
and the Lord? As to the former, when he was perchance in some way injured, he
insulted thee, and thou wert exasperated. But thou insultest the Lord, when thou art neither
treated with injustice nor ill-will by Him, but receiving blessing of Him day by day. Consider,
then, that if God chose to search out rigourously what is done against Him, we should not
live a single day. For the prophet saith, “If Thou wilt be extreme to mark iniquity, O Lord,
O Lord, who shall stand?”1803 And, to pass by all those other things, of which the conscience
of every sinner is aware, and of which he no has no human witness, but God only; were we
to be called to account for those which are open and admitted, what allowance could we
expect for such sins? What if He were to scrutinize our listlessness and negligence in our
prayers; and how, whilst standing before God and supplicating Him, we do not exhibit even
so much fear and reverence for Him as servants do toward their masters, as soldiers do toward
their officers, as friends do toward friends?1804 When thou discoursest with a friend, thou
givest heed to what thou art doing, but when waiting on God on account of thy sins, and
asking pardon for so many offences, and thinking that thou shalt obtain forgiveness, thou
art often listless; and whilst thy knees are lying on the ground, thou sufferest thy mind to
wander every where, in the market, or in the house, babbling the while with thy mouth

vainly and to no purpose! And this we experience, not once or twice, but frequently! Did
God then choose to scrutinize this alone, do you think that we could obtain pardon, or be
able to find any excuse? Truly, I think not!</p>
<p>4. But what if the evil-speakings which we unkindly utter every day one against another,
were brought forward against us; as well as the rash judgments with which we condemn our
neighbour; and that for no reason, but because we are fond of blaming, and given to find
fault; what, I say, should we be able to allege in defence? Again, should He scrutinize those
roving glances of ours, and those evil desires which we carry in the mind, so frequently admitting
disgraceful and impure thoughts from the unlicensed wandering of the eyes, what
punishment must we not sustain? And should He demand a reason for our revilings, (for
He saith, “Whosoever shall say to his brother, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire,”)
how could we, forsooth, open our mouths, or move our lips at all, or say any thing great or
small in reply? Moreover, as to the vainglorious feelings we allow in our prayers, our fastings,
our almsgiving, were we to scrutinize, them,—I do not say, were God, but were we ourselves,
who are the sinners, to do this,—should we be able to lift up our eyes toward heaven? Then,
as to the deceits which we devise one against another—praising a brother now, whilst he is
present, and discoursing as with a friend; and when he is absent, reviling him; can we endure
the punishments of all these? Then what of the oaths? or what of the lying? what of the
perjuries? what of the unjust anger, and of the envy with which we too often regard men
when honoured, not enemies only, but also friends? Furthermore, what of the fact, that we
are pleased when others suffer evil, and account the misfortunes of others a consolation for
our own distress?</p>
<p>5. But suppose the penalty were exacted for our listlessness in our solemn assemblies
what would our condition be? For this ye cannot but know, that often whilst God Himself
is addressing us all by His prophet, we are holding frequent and long conversations with
those near us, about matters which in no way concern us. Passing by, then, all the rest,
should He choose to exact of us the penalty due for this sin only, what hope of salvation will
there be? For do not suppose that this offence is a small one, but if thou wouldest be aware
of its magnitude, examine how this very thing is regarded among men, and then thou wilt
perceive the enormity of the sin. Just venture, when some magistrate is talking to thee, or
rather some friend who is of somewhat superior dignity, to turn from him, and enter into
conversation with thy servant; and thou wilt then perceive, what thou venturest on in dealing
thus with God! For if he be any one of the more distinguished classes, he will even demand
reparation of thee for such an insult. Yet God, whilst He is treated with as great, and still
greater contempt than this, every day; and that not by one, or two, or three persons, but by
almost all of us; is still forbearing and longsuffering, not in regard to this alone, but to other
things which are far more grievous. For these things are what must be admitted, and what
are obvious to all, and by almost all men they are daringly practised. But there are yet others,

<pb n="702"/>
which the conscience of those who commit them is privy to. Surely, if we were to think of
all this; if we were to reason with ourselves, supposing even that we were the cruelest and
harshest of men, yet upon taking a survey of the multitude of our sins, we should for very
fear and agony be unable to remember the injury done by others towards ourselves. Bear
in mind the river of fire; the envenomed worm; the fearful Judgment, where all things shall
be naked and open! Reflect, that what are now hidden things, are then to be brought to light!
But shouldest thou pardon thy neighbour all these sins which till then await their disclosure
are done away with here; and when thou shalt depart this life, thou wilt not drag after thee
any of that chain of transgressions; so that thou receivest greater things than thou givest.
For many such transgressions, indeed, we have often committed, which no other person
knoweth; and when we think, that on That Day these our sins shall lie exposed to the eyes
of all, upon the public theatre of the universe, we are in pain beyond any punishment, being
choked and strangled by our conscience. Yet this shame, great as it is; these sins, these
punishments, great as they are; there is a possibility of purging away through forgiveness
exercised toward our neighbour.</p>
<p>6. For indeed there is nothing equal to this virtue.1805 Wouldest thou learn the power
of this virtue? “Though Moses and Samuel stood before Me,” saith God, “my soul would
not regard them.”1806 Nevertheless, those whom Moses and Samuel were not able to snatch
away from God’s wrath, this precept when observed was able to snatch away. Hence it is,
that He continually exhorts those to whom He had spoken these things, saying, “Let none
of you revengefully imagine1807 evil against his brother in your heart,” and “let none of you
think of his neighbour’s malice.”1808 It is not said merely, forego wrath; but retain it not in
thy mind; think not of it; part with all thy resentment; do away the sore. For thou supposest
that thou art paying him back the injury; but thou art first tormenting thyself, and setting
up thy rage as an executioner within thee in every part, and tearing up thine own bowels.
For what can be more wretched than a man perpetually angry? And just as maniacs, who
never enjoy tranquility, so also he who is resentful, and retains an enemy, will never have
the enjoyment of any peace; incessantly raging, as he does, and daily increasing the tempest
of his thoughts calling to mind his words and acts, and detesting the very name of him who
has aggrieved him. Do you but mention his enemy, he becomes furious at once, and sustains
much inward anguish; and should he chance to get only a bare sight of him, he fears and
trembles, as if encountering the worst evils. Yea, if he perceives any of his relations, if but

his garment, or his dwelling, or street, he is tormented by the sight of them. For as in the
case of those who are beloved, their faces, their garments, their sandals, their houses, or
streets, excite us, the instant we behold them; so also should we observe a servant, or friend,
or house, or street, or any thing else belonging to those we hate and hold our enemies, we
are stung by all these things; and the strokes we endure from the sight of each one of them
are frequent and continual.</p>
<p>7. What is the need then of sustaining such a siege, such torment and such punishment?
For if hell did not threaten the resentful; yet for the very torment resulting from the thing
itself we ought to forgive the offences of those who have aggrieved us. But when deathless
punishments remain behind, what can be more senseless than the man, who both here and
there brings punishment upon himself, while he thinks to be revenged upon his enemy! For
suppose that we see him still prosperous, then we are ready to die of chagrin; but if in an
adverse condition, we are in fear, lest some propitious turn of events should take place. But
for both of these there is stored up for us an inevitable punishment. For, “Rejoice not,” he
saith, “when thine enemy stumbleth.”1809 And tell me not of the greatness of the injuries
received; for it is not this which maketh thy wrath to be retained; but this, that thou art unmindful
of thine own offences; that thou hast not before thine eyes either hell or the fear of
God! To convince thee that this is true, I will endeavour to make it manifest from the events
which have happened in this city. For when the persons impeached of those flagrant crimes
were dragged to the tribunal of justice;—when the fire was kindled within, and the executioners
stood around, and were lacerating their ribs,1810 if any one standing beside them
had proclaimed, “If ye have any enemies, dismiss your resentment, and we shall be able to
set you free from this punishment;”—would they not have kissed their very feet?1811 And
why do I say their feet? If one had bidden them take them for their masters, they would not
then have refused. But if punishment that is human, and hath its bounds, would have triumphed
over all anger, much more would the punishment to come, if it had continual
possession of our thoughts, expel from the soul not only resentment, but every evil imagination?
For what is easier, I ask, than to get rid of resentment against the injurer? Is there
any long journey to be undertaken? Is there any expenditure of money? Is the aid of others
to be invoked? It suffices only to resolve, and the good deed at once reaches the goal. What
punishment, then, must we not deserve, if on account of worldly affairs we stoop to slavish
occupations; and shew a servility unworthy of ourselves; and expend money; and enter into

conversation with porters, that we may flatter1812 impious men; and do and say all manner
of things, so that we may perfectly attain the end we have in view; and yet cannot endure,
for the sake of God’s laws, to entreat a brother who hath injured us, but consider it a disgrace
to be the first to make advances. Art thou ashamed, tell me, when thou art going to be the
first to make gain? Rather, on the contrary, you ought to be ashamed of persisting in this
passion; and waiting until the person who has committed the injury comes to you to be reconciled;
for this is a disgrace, and a reproach, and the greatest loss.</p>
<p>8. For he who comes the first it is, who reaps all the fruit; and when at the entreaty of
another thou layest aside thine anger, the good work is to be accounted his; for thou hast
discharged the law as doing a favour to him, not as obeying God. But if, when no one entreats,
when not even the man who has done the injury approaches, or solicits thee, thou thyself
dismissing from thy thoughts all shame, and all delay, runnest forward freely to the injurer,
and dost quell anger entirely, the good deed becomes wholly thine own, and thou shalt receive
all the reward. If I say, “Practise fasting,” thy plea, perchance, is bodily weakness. If I say,
“Give to the poor,” it is poverty, and bringing up children. If I say, “Make time for the assembles
of the Church,” it is worldly cares. If I say, “Give heed to what is spoken, and consider
the power of what is taught,” it is want of learning. If I say, “Correct another,” you say,
“When counsel is given him, he takes no heed, for I have often spoken, and been scorned.”
Frigid, as such pretences are, yet you have some pretences to allege. But suppose I say,
“Dismiss thine anger,” which of these wilt thou then allege? For neither infirmity of body,
nor poverty, nor lack of culture, nor want of leisure, nor any other thing of that kind hast
thou to advance; but this sin is above all other the most inexcusable. How wilt thou be able
to stretch thine hands toward heaven, or how to move thy tongue, or to ask pardon? For
although God be desirous to pardon thy sins, thou thyself dost not suffer Him, while thou
retainest that of thy fellow-servant! But suppose that he is cruel, fierce, and savage, and
greedy of revenge and retaliation? Why for this reason thou oughtest especially to grant
forgiveness.1813 Hast thou been wronged much, and robbed, and slandered, and injured in
matters of the first importance; and dost thou wish to see thine enemy punished? Yet even
for this, it will be of use to thee to pardon him. For suppose that thou thyself takest vengeance,
and prosecutest it, either by words, by deeds, or imprecation against the adversary; then
God will not afterwards prosecute it too, inasmuch as thou hast taken thy revenge; and not
only will He not prosecute the matter for thee, but will also demand a penalty of thee as a
despiser of Himself. For if this same thing takes place amongst mankind, viz. that if we beat
the servant of another, the master is indignant, and calls the act an insult (for although we

be treated injuriously, whether by slaves, or by freemen, it is fitting that we should await the
legal decisions of magistrates or masters); if then even amongst men, to avenge ourselves
would not be safe, how much more so when God is the avenger!</p>
<p>9. Hath thy neighbour wronged and grieved thee, and involved thee in a thousand ills?
Be it so, yet do not prosecute vengeance on thine own part, lest thou do desire to thy Lord!
Yield the matter to God, and He will dispose of it much better than thou canst desire. To
thee He has given charge simply to pray for the injurer; but how to deal with him, He hath
ordered thee to leave to Himself. Never canst thou so avenge thyself, as He is prepared to
avenge thee, if thou givest place to Him alone, and dost not utter imprecations on him who
has aggrieved thee; but sufferest God to be sole arbiter of the sentence. For although we may
pardon those who have aggrieved us; although we may be reconciled; although we may pray
for them; yet God does not pardon, unless they themselves are converted, and become better.
And He withholds pardon, with a view to their own advantage. For He praises thee, and
approves thee for thy spiritual wisdom; but visits him, in order that he may not grow worse
by thy wisdom. So that the common saying on this subject is not to the point. For many
there are, who when I reproach them because after being exhorted to be reconciled to their
enemies, they will not be persuaded to it, think fit to proffer this apology, which is nothing
less than a cloak for their iniquity. “I am unwilling,” says one, “to be reconciled, lest I should
make the man worse, more ill-tempered, and more disposed to treat me contemptuously
hereafter.” Besides this, they also make this plea: “Many people,” say they, “think it is
weakness in me to come first to a reconciliation, and to entreat my enemy.” All these things
are foolish; for the Eye that slumbers not has seen thy good intention; wherefore, it behoveth
thee to make no account of the opinion of thy fellow-servants, when thou hast gained the
opinion of the Judge, Who is about to try thy cause.</p>
<p>10. But if thy concern be, lest thine enemy should become worse by thy clemency learn
this,—that it is not thus he is made worse; but far rather if thou art unreconciled. For although
he were the vilest of men; although he might neither confess nor publish it openly; yet he
will silently approve thy Christian wisdom, and in his own conscience will respect thy gentleness.
Should he, however, persist in the same iniquity, whilst thou art endeavouring to
soften and conciliate, he will have to abide the heaviest punishment from God. And that ye
may know, that although we should pray for our enemies, and for those who have injured
us, God does not pardon, if they are likely to become worse by our forbearance, I will mention
to you an ancient piece of history. Miriam once spake against Moses. What then did God
do? He sent a leprosy upon her, and made her unclean; notwithstanding that in other respects
she had been meek and modest. Afterwards, when Moses himself, the party injured, besought

<pb n="706"/>
that the wrath might be removed, God consented not: but what did He say? “If her father
had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed? Let her remain,” saith He, “without the
camp seven days.”1814 But what He means is to this effect. “If,” saith He, “she had a father,
and he had put her away from his presence, would she not have undergone the rebuke? I
approve thee indeed for thy fraternal piety, and thy meekness and clemency; but I know
when is the due time to remit her punishment.” Do thou then shew all humanity towards
thy brother; and do not pardon his offences in the desire of a greater punishment for him,
but of thy tenderness and good will; yet understand this very plainly, that the more he shall
slight thee, whilst thou art labouring to conciliate, so much the greater punishment will he
draw down upon himself.</p>
<p>11. What sayest thou? tell me, Is he the worse for thy attentions? This is blame to him,
but thy praise. Thy praise, that, whilst seeing him thus behave himself, thou didst not desist
from doing God’s will in conciliating him. But to him it is blame, because he has not been
made better by thy clemency. But1815 “it is far more desirable that others should be blamed
because of us, than we because of them.” Make me not this frigid reply, of saying, “I am
afraid of its being thought that I made an overture to him out of fear; and that he will
therefore despise me the more.” Such a reply indicates a childish and foolish mind, agitated
about human approbation. Let him suppose, that it was out of fear you made the first advance
to him; your reward will be so much the greater; since, being aware of this beforehand, you
still consented to endure all for the fear of God. For he who is in chase of human approbation,
and seeks reconciliation for that end, curtails the recompense of reward; but he who is quite
sure of the fact, that many will vilify and ridicule him, and even then does not desist, from
the attempt at reconciliation, will have a twofold, yea, a threefold crown. And this is indeed
the man who does it for the sake of God. Nor tell me, that the man has wronged thee in this,
or in that particular; for if he hath displayed, in his conduct towards thee, every kind of
iniquity that is in man, yet even so God hath enjoined thee to forgive him all!</p>
<p>12. Lo! I forewarn, and testify, and proclaim this with a voice that all may hear! “Let no
one who hath an enemy draw near the sacred Table, or receive the Lord’s Body! Let no one
who draws near have an enemy! Hast thou an enemy? Draw not near! Wilt thou draw near?
Be reconciled, and then draw near, and touch the Holy Thing!” Nor, indeed, is this my declaration.
Rather it is that of the Lord Himself, Who was crucified for us. That He might
reconcile thee to the Father, He refused not to be sacrificed, and to shed His blood! And art
thou unwilling to utter a word, or to make the first advance, that thou mayest be reconciled
to thy fellow-servant? Hear what the Lord saith, concerning those who are in this disposition;

“If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against
thee”—He does not say, “wait for him to come to thee,” nor “speak with another as mediator,”
nor “entreat some other,” but “do thou thyself make the advance towards him.” For the exhortation
is, “Go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother.”1816 O transcendent wonder!
Does He Himself account it no dishonour, that the gift should be left unoffered, and dost
thou think it a mark of disgrace to go first and be reconciled? And how can such a case, I
ask, be deemed worthy of pardon? Were you to see a member of yours cut off, would you
not use every exertion so that it might be reunited to the body? This do with regard to thy
brethren; when thou seest them cut off from thy friendship, make all haste to recover them!
Do not wait for them to make the first advance, but press onward, that thou mayest be
foremost to receive the prize.</p>
<p>13. We are commanded to have only one enemy, the devil. With him be thou never reconciled!
But with a brother, never be at enmity in thy heart. And if there should be any
narrowness of soul, let it be only an ephemeral thing, and never last beyond a day’s space.
For, “let not the sun,” he saith, “go down upon your wrath.”1817 For if, before evening, you
are reconciled, you will obtain some pardon from God. But if you remain longer at enmity,
that enmity is no longer the result of your being suddenly carried away by anger and resentment,
but of wickedness, and of a foul spirit, and one which makes a practice of malice! And
this is not the only terrible thing, that you deprive yourself of pardon, but that the right
course becomes still more difficult. For when one day is past, the shame becomes greater;
and when the second has arrived, it is still further increased; and if it reach a third, and a
fourth day, it will add a fifth. Thus the five become ten; the ten, twenty; the twenty an hun-
dred; and thenceforth the wound will become incurable; for as time goes on, the breach
becomes wider. But do thou, O man, give way to none of these irrational passions; nor be
ashamed, nor blush, nor say within yourself, “A short time ago we called each other such
names, and said a vast number of things fit or not fit to be spoken; and shall I now hurry at
once to a reconciliation? Who then will not blame my excessive easiness?” I answer, no one
who has sense will blame thy easiness; but when thou remainest implacable, then, all persons
will deride thee. Then thou wilt give to the devil the advantage of this wide breach. For the
enmity becomes then more difficult to be got rid of, not by mere lapse of time, but from the
circumstances too that take place in the meanwhile. For as “charity covereth a multitude of
sins,”1818 so enmity gives a being to sins that do not exist, and all persons henceforth, are
deemed worthy of credit who turn accusers; who rejoice in the ills of others, and blaze abroad
what is disgraceful in their conduct.</p>

<p>14. Knowing all these things then, make the first advance to a brother; lay hold of him
before he has entirely shrunk away from thee; and should it be necessary, to run through
all the city on the same day; should it be necessary to go beyond the walls, or to take a long
journey; still leaving all other things that may be in hand, attend only to this one work of
reconciling thy brother. For if the work be laborious, reflect that it is for God’s sake thou
undergoest all this, and thou shalt receive sufficient consolation. Stir up thy soul also when
it is shrinking, and backward, and bashful, and ashamed, by perpetually harping on this
theme and saying, Why art thou delaying? Why art thou shrinking and holding back? our
concern is not for money, nor for any other of these fleeting things, but for our salvation.
God bids us do all these things, and all things should be secondary to His commands. This
matter is a sort of spiritual merchandise. Let us not neglect it, let us not be slothful. Let our
enemy too understand that we have taken much pains, in order to do what is well-pleasing
unto God. And though he may again insult, or strike us, or do any other such thing of a still
more grievous kind, let us sustain all things courageously, since we are not so much benefitting
him thereby, as ourselves. Of all good works, this shall most especially befriend us on
That Day. We have sinned and offended in many and great matters, and have provoked our
Lord. Through His lovingkindness He hath given us this way of reconciliation. Let us, then,
not betray this good treasure. For had He not power to charge us simply to make reconciliation,
and not have any reward assigned to it? for whom hath He to gainsay or rectify His
appointment? Nevertheless, through His great lovingkindness, He hath promised us a large
and unspeakable reward, and one which we must be especially desirous to obtain, the pardon
of our sins; thus also making this our obedience more easy of performance.</p>
<p>15. What allowance then can be made for us, if even when we might receive so great a
reward we still do not obey the Lawgiver, but persist in our contempt; for that this is a contempt
is plain from hence. If the Emperor had laid down a law, that all those who were enemies
should be reconciled to one another, or have their heads cut off, should we not every
one make haste to a reconciliation with his neighbour? Yes! truly, I think so! What excuse
then have we, in not ascribing the same honour to the Lord, that we should do to those who
are our fellow-servants? For this reason we are commanded to say, “Forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors.”1819 What can be more mild, what more merciful, than this precept!
He hath made thee a judge of the pardon of thine own offences! If thou forgivest few
things, He forgives thee few! If thou forgivest many things, He forgives thee many! If thou
pardonest from the heart, and sincerely, God in like manner also pardons thee! If besides
pardoning him thou accountest him a friend, God will also thus deal with thee; so that the
more he has sinned, so much the more is it necessary that we should hasten to a reconcili-

ation; since it becomes a cause of greater offences being forgiven us.1820 Art thou willing to
learn1821 that there is no pardon for us, if we are mindful of injuries, and that there is no
one who can deliver us? I will make what I assert plain by an example. Suppose that a
neighbour has done you a certain injury, that he has seized your goods; has confiscated or
embezzled them; and not to confine myself to such a case, let me add to it more things and
worse beside, and whatever you will; he has longed to destroy you; he has exposed you to a
thousand perils; he has manifested every sort of malice towards you; and left nothing undone
that human wickedness can do? For not to go over every thing separately, suppose that he
has injured you to such an extent as no one ever injured any before;—why, even in this case,
if you are resentful, you will not be worthy of pardon. And I will explain how it is so.</p>
<p>16. If one of your servants owed you an hundred pieces of gold; and some one again
was indebted to him in a few pieces of silver; and if the servants’ debtor were to come, and
entreat and supplicate you that he might obtain indulgence, and you were to call in your
own servant, and charge him, saying, “Forgive this man the debt, and from the sum thou
owest me I will deduct this debt;” should that servant afterwards be wicked and shameless
enough to seize on his debtor, could any one then rescue him out of your hands? Would
you not most assuredly inflict a thousand stripes upon him, as having been insulted to the
last extremity? And very justly too. This also God will do: for He will say to thee on That
Day, “O wicked and villainous servant, yea, was it of thine own thou forgavest him? Out of
what thou wert indebted to Me, thou wert ordered to account to him. For “Remit,” He saith,
“and I will remit unto thee! although, to speak truly,1822 if I had not added this condition,
it would have been even then thy duty to have remitted at the instance of thy Lord. But in
this case, I did not command thee as a master, but I asked it as a favour from a friend; and
I asked it out of My own property; and I promised to give greater things in return; and yet
with all this, thou wert not made a better man.” Moreover men, when they act in this manner,
put down as much to their own servants’ accounts, as the measure of the debt is. Thus, for
example, suppose the servant owes his master a hundred pieces of gold; and the debtor of
the servant owes ten pieces, should the latter remit his debt, the master does not remit him
his hundred pieces, but these ten only; and all the rest he still demands. But it is not so with
God; if you remit a1823 few things to your fellow-servant, He remits all your debt.</p>

<p>17. Whence does this appear? From the very Prayer1824 itself. “For if,” saith He, “ye
forgive men their debts, your heavenly Father will forgive your debts.”1825 And as much as
the difference is between “a hundred pence” and “ten thousand talents,”1826 so great is it
between the debts on the one side, and those on the other!</p>
<p>What punishment then must he not deserve, who when he would receive ten thousand
talents, in the room of a hundred pence,1827 yet will not even so remit this small sum, but
offers up the Prayer against himself. For when thou sayest, “Forgive us, as we forgive,” and
afterwards dost not forgive, thou art supplicating of God nothing else than that He would
entirely deprive thee of all excuse or indulgence. “But I do not presume to say,” replies some
one, “Forgive me as I forgive” but only, “Forgive me.” But what matters this? For if thou say
it not thyself, yet God so doeth; as thou forgivest, He forgives. And this He hath made quite
evident from what follows; for there it is said, “If ye forgive not men, neither doth your
heavenly Father forgive you.” Think not, therefore, that it is a pious caution, not to repeat
the whole sentence; nor offer up the Prayer by halves, but as He bade thee so pray thou, in
order that the very obligation of that expression, putting thee daily in fear, may compel thee
to the exercise of forgiveness towards thy neighbours.</p>
<p>18. Do not tell me, “I have besought him many times, I have intreated, I have supplicated,
but I have not effected a reconciliation.” Never desist till you have reconciled him. For He
said not, “Leave thy gift, and go thy way.” Entreat thy brother. But, “Go thy way. Be reconciled.”
1828 So that, although you may have made many entreaties, yet you must not desist
until you have persuaded. God entreats us every day, and we do not hear; and yet He does
not cease entreating. And dost thou then disdain to entreat thy fellow-servant. How is it
then possible for thee ever to be saved? Suppose that thou hast often pleaded and been repulsed;
for this, however, thou wilt obtain a larger reward. For in proportion as he is contentious,
and thou perseverest in entreating, so much the more is thy recompense increased.
In proportion as the good work is accomplished with greater difficulty, and the reconciliation
is one of much labour, so much the greater will be the judgment on him, and so much the
brighter will be the crowns of victory for thy forbearance. Let us not merely applaud all this,
but exemplify it too in our deeds; and never recede from the work, until we are restored to
our former state of friendship. For it is not enough merely to avoid grieving an enemy, or
doing him an injury, or being in our minds unkindly disposed towards him; but it is necessary

that we should prepare him to be kindly affected towards ourselves. For I hear many saying,
“I have no hostility; I am not annoyed; neither have I any thing to do with him.”1829 But
this is not what God commands, that thou shouldest have nothing to do with him; but that
thou shouldest have much to do with him. For this reason he is thy “brother.”1830 For this
reason He said not, “Forgive thy brother what thou hast against him. But what then? “Go
thy way. First be reconciled to him;” and should he have “any thing against thee,” yet desist
not, before thou hast reunited the member in friendly concord.” But thou, who in order
that thou mayest obtain a useful servant, tellest out the gold, and discoursest with many
merchants, and often undertakest long journeys, tell me, art thou not up and doing to the
utmost, in order that thou mayest convert an enemy into a friend? And how then wilt thou
be able to call upon God, whilst thou art thus neglecting His laws? Assuredly, the possession
of a servant will be of no great profit to us; but the making an enemy a friend, will render
God propitious and favourable toward us; and will easily set us free from our sins; and gain
us praise with men, as well as great security in our life; for nothing can be more unsafe than
he who has even only a single enemy. For our earthly reputation is injured, whilst such a
man is saying a thousand evil things of us to every body. Our minds are also in a state of
fermentation, and our conscience disturbed; and we are exposed to a continual tempest of
anxious thoughts.</p>
<p>19. Now since we are conscious of the truth of all this, let us set ourselves free from
chastisement and vengeance; and let us shew our reverence for the present feast, by doing
all that has been said; and those same favours which we think to obtain from the Emperor
on account of the feast, let us ourselves enable others to enjoy. For I hear, indeed, many
saying, that the Emperor, out of his reverence for the Holy Passover, will be reconciled to
the city and will pardon all its offences. How absurd then is it, that when we have to depend
for our safety upon others, we bring forward the feast, and its claims; but that when we are
commanded to be reconciled one with another, we treat this same feast with disdain, and
think nothing of it. No one, truly, so pollutes this holy feast, as he does, who, whilst he is
keeping it, cherishes malignity. Or rather, I might say, that such a person cannot possibly
keep it, though he should remain without food ten days successively. For where there is
enmity and strife, there can be neither fast nor festival. Thou wouldest not dare to touch
the holy Sacrifice with unwashed hands,1831 however pressing the necessity might be. Ap-

that where strictly kept, they are grounds for such an appeal as this; and why not, in better men, for

of holy things, and here they are treated quite as subservient to duties of a higher order. The word here rendered

proach not then with an unwashed soul! For this is far worse than the other and brings a
heavier punishment. For1832 nothing so fills the mind with impurity, as anger remaining
constantly within it. The spirit of meekness settles not where wrath or passion exists; and
when a man is destitute of the Holy Spirit, what hope of salvation shall he have, and how
shall he walk aright? Do not then, O beloved, whilst thou art desirous to be revenged of
thine enemy, cast thyself down headlong; nor cause thyself to be left alone without the
guardianship of God! For, in truth, if the duty were a difficult one, yet the greatness of the
punishment, which results from this action of disobedience, were sufficient to arouse the
most slothful and supine, and to persuade them to undergo every degree of labour. But now
our argument has shewn that the duty is most easy, if we are willing.</p>
<p>20. Let us not then be negligent of what is our life, but let us be in earnest; and do every
thing, in order that we may be without an enemy, and so present ourselves at the sacred
Table. For nothing,—nothing, I repeat, of what God commands will be difficult, if we give
heed: and this is evident from the case of those who are already reformed. How many used
to be cheated by the habit of using oaths, and to fancy this practice extremely difficult of
reformation. Nevertheless, through the grace of God, when ye put forth but a little effort,
ye for the most part washed yourselves clean of this vice. For this reason I beseech you to
lay aside also what remains, and to become teachers of others. And to those who have not
yet achieved it, but allege to us the length of time during which they were before swearers,
and say that it is impossible for them to pluck up in a short time that which has been rooted
for many years; I would make this answer, that where any precept among those commanded
by God requires to be put in due practice, there is no need of length of time, nor of a multi-
tude of days, nor an interval of years; but of fear only, and reverence of soul; and then we
shall be sure to accomplish it, and that in a short time. But lest you should suppose that I
speak these things at random, take a man whom you think much addicted to swearing; one
that swears more times than he speaks;1833 hand this man over to me for only ten days, and
if I do not rid him of all his habit in these few days, pass the severest sentence on me.</p>
<p>21. And that these words are not a vain boast, shall be made manifest to you from things
that have already happened. What could be more stupid than the Ninevites? What more
devoid of understanding? Yet, nevertheless, these barbarian, foolish people, who had never
yet heard any one teaching them wisdom, who had never received such precepts from others,
when they heard the prophet saying, “Yet three days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown,”1834

laid aside, within three days, the whole of their evil customs. The fornicator became chaste;
the bold man meek; the grasping and extortionate moderate and kind; the slothful industrious.
They did not, indeed, reform one, or two, or three, or four vices by way of remedy, but
the whole of their iniquity. But whence does this appear, says some one? From the words
of the prophet; for the same who had been their accuser, and who had said, that “the cry of
their wickedness hath ascended up even to heaven:”1835 himself again bears testimony of
an opposite kind, by saying, “God saw that every one departed from their own evil ways.”1836
He does not say, from fornication, or adultery, or theft, but from their “own evil ways.” And
how did they depart? As God knew, not as man judged of the matter. After this are we not
ashamed, must we not blush, if it turns out that in three days only the barbarians laid aside
all their wickedness, but that we, who have been urged and taught during so many days,1837
have not got the better of one bad habit? These men had, moreover, gone to the extreme of
wickedness before; for when you hear it said, “The cry of their wickedness is come up before
me;” you can understand nothing else than the excess of their wickedness. Nevertheless,
within three days they were capable of being transformed to a state of complete1838 virtue.
For where the fear of God is, there is no need of days, or of an interval of time; as likewise,
on the contrary, days are of no service where there is a want of this fear. For just as in the
case of rusted1839 implements, he that rubs them only with water, though he spend a long
time on them, will not rid them of all that foulness; but he that puts them in a furnace, will
make them presently brighter than even those newly fabricated: so too a soul, stained with
the rust of sin, if it cleanse itself slightly, and in a negligent way, and be every day repenting,
will gain no further advantage. But if it cast itself into the furnace, as it were, of the fear of
God, it will in a very short time purge all away.</p>
<p>22. Let us not then be procrastinating till to-morrow. For we “know not what the next
day may bring forth;”1840 nor let us say, “we shall conquer this habit by little and little;”
since this little and little will never come to an end. Wherefore, dismissing that excuse, we
should say, “If we do not reform the practice of swearing to-day, we will not leave off till we
do,1841 though ten thousand things were to press us; though it were necessary to die, or to

be punished, or to lose all we have; we will not give the devil the advantage of slackness, nor
the pretext of delay.” Should God perceive thy soul inflamed, and thy diligence quickened,
then He also Himself will lend His assistance to thy reformation! Yea, I pray and beseech
you, let us be in earnest, lest we also hear it said of us, “The men of Nineveh shall rise up,
and shall condemn this generation;”1842 for these, when they had once heard, reformed
themselves; but we are not converted after frequent hearing. These were proficients in every
part of virtue, but we in no part. They when they heard that their city would be overthrown
were affrighted; but we, though we have heard of Hell, are not affrighted: these, men who
did not partake of the instructions of the prophets; we, enjoying the advantage of perpetual
teaching, and of much grace.</p>
<p>23. These things I now speak to you, not as if reproving you for your own sins, but for
the sake of others; for I know full well that by you (as I have already observed), this law
concerning swearing has been accomplished. But this does not suffice for our safety, unless
by teaching we amend others, since he who produced the one talent, restoring as he did the
whole portion committed to him, was punished, because he had not enriched that with
which he was entrusted. Wherefore, let us not regard this point, that we ourselves have been
set free from this sin; but until we have delivered others from it, let us not desist; and let
every one offer to God ten friends whom he has corrected; whether thou hast servants, or
apprentices:1843 or if you have neither servants, nor apprentices, you have friends; these do
thou reform. Further, do not make me this reply; “We have banished oaths for the most
part, and we are rarely caught in that snare;” but let even this rarity of offending be got rid
of. If you had lost one piece of gold, would you not go about to all persons, searching and
making enquiry, in order to find it? This do also with regard to oaths. If you perceive that
you have been cheated out of one oath, weep, lament, as though your whole substance were
lost. Again I say what I did before. Shut up thyself at home; make it a subject of practice and
exercise along with thy wife, thy children, and domestics. Say to thyself in the first instance,
“I must not put a finger to private or public matters until I have rectified this soul of mine.”
If you will thus school your own sons, they too will instruct their children in turn, and thus
this discipline, reaching even to the consummation and appearing of Christ, will bring all
that great reward to those who go to the root of the matter. If your son has learnt to say,
“Believe me;”1844 he will not be able to go up to the theatre, or to enter a tavern, or to spend
his time at dice; for that word, lying upon his mouth instead of a bridle, will make him
however unwilling feel shame and blush. But if at any time he should appear in these places,
it will quickly compel him to retreat.1845 Suppose some persons laugh. Do thou on the

other hand weep for their transgression! Many also once laughed at Noah whilst he was
preparing the ark; but when the flood came, he laughed at them; or rather, the just man
never laughed at them at all, but wept and bewailed! When therefore thou seest persons
laughing, reflect that those teeth, that grin now, will one day have to sustain that most
dreadful wailing and gnashing, and that they will remember this same laugh on That Day
whilst they are grinding and gnashing! Then thou too shalt remember this laugh! How did
the rich man laugh at Lazarus! But afterwards, when he beheld him in Abraham’s bosom,
he had nothing left to do but to bewail himself!</p>
<p>24. Being mindful then of all these things, be urgent with all, for the speedy fulfilment
of this precept. And tell me not, that you will do this by little and little; nor put it off till the
morrow, for this to-morrow never finds an end. Forty days1846 have already passed away.
Should the Holy Easter pass away, I will thenceforward pardon no one, nor employ further
admonition, but a commanding authority, and severity not to be despised. For this apology
drawn from custom is of no force. Why may not the thief as well plead custom, and get free
from punishment? Why may not the murderer and adulterer? Therefore I protest, and give
warning to all, that if, when I have met you in private, and put the matter to the proof (and
I will certainly put it to the proof), I detect any who have not corrected this vice, I will inflict
punishment upon them, by ordering them to be excluded from the Holy Mysteries;1847 not
that they may remain always shut out, but that having reformed themselves, they may thus
enter in, and with a pure conscience enjoy the Holy Table; for this is to be a partaker of the
Communion! God grant that through the prayers of those who preside over us,1848 as well
as of all the saints, having corrected these and all other deficiencies, we may obtain the
kingdom of heaven through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with
Whom to the Father, together with the Holy Spirit, be glory, honour, and adoration, now
and ever, world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>On the return of Flavian the Bishop, and the reconciliation of the Emperor with the city, and
with1849 those who had offended in overthrowing the Statues.</p>
<p>1. To-day, I shall begin with that very same saying with which I have ever been used to
open my address to you during the season of danger, and shall say together with you, “Blessed
be God,” Who hath granted us this day to celebrate this holy Feast with much joy and
gladness; and hath restored the head to the body, the shepherd to the sheep, the master to
the disciples, the general to the soldiers, the High Priest to the Priests! Blessed be God, “Who
doeth exceeding abundantly above what we ask or think!”1850 For to us it would have seemed
sufficient, had we been but delivered from the hitherto impending evil; and for this we made
all our supplication. But the God who loveth man, and ever in His giving surpasseth our
prayers by an excess of bounty, hath brought back our Father too, sooner than we could at
all have expected. Who would, indeed, have thought that in so few days, he would have
gone, and have had audience with the Emperor, and set us free from the calamity, and again
come back to us so quickly, as to be able to anticipate the Holy Passover, and to celebrate it
with ourselves? Behold, however, this event, which was so contrary to expectation, hath
been realized! We have received back our Father; and we enjoy so much the greater pleasure,
inasmuch as we have received him back now beyond our hopes. For all these things, let us
give thanks to the merciful God, and be amazed at the power, the lovingkindness, the wisdom,
and the tender care which has been manifested on behalf of the city. For the devil had attempted
its entire subversion through the daring crimes committed; but God, by means of
this same calamity, hath adorned the city, the Priest, and the Emperor; and hath made them
all more illustrious.</p>
<p>2. The city hath won renown, because when such a danger had overtaken her, passing
by at once all those who were in power, those who were surrounded with much wealth,
those who possessed great influence with the Emperor, it fled for refuge to the Church, and
to the Priest of God, and with much faith, rested itself entirely upon the hope which is from
above! Many indeed, after the departure of the common Father, were ready to terrify those
who lay in prison, by saying, “The Emperor does not lay aside1851 his wrath, but is still more
provoked, and is thinking of the utter ruin of the city.” But whilst they were whispering all
this, and much more, they who were then in bonds were not the least intimidated, but upon
our saying, “These things are false, and they are a device of the devil, who desires to fill you

an invective “against” the offenders. It does contain a very strong one obliquely.</note>

with consternation;” they replied to us, “We need no consolation to be addressed to us; for
we know where we have taken refuge from the first; and upon what hope we have rested
ourselves. We have fixed our safety upon the sacred anchor! We have not entrusted this to
man, but to the Almighty God; therefore we are most assuredly confident, that the result
will be favourable; for it is impossible, truly impossible, that this hope can ever be confounded!”
To how many crowns, how many encomiums, is this equivalent for our city? How
much of God’s favour will it draw down upon us too in our other affairs! For it is not, indeed
it is not a thing belonging to a soul of mean order to be watchful against the attack of
temptations, and to look to God; and scorning all that is human, to yearn after that Divine
aid.</p>
<p>3. The city then hath thus won renown; and the Priest again not less than the city, for
he exposed his life for all; and while there were many things to hinder him, as the winter,
his age, the feast, and not less than these, his sister, then at her last breath, he raised himself
above all these obstacles, and did not say to himself, “What a thing is this? Our only remaining
sister, she who hath drawn the yoke of Christ along with me, and who hath been my domestic
companion so long, is now at her last breath; and shall we desert her, and go hence, and not
behold her expiring, and uttering her paring words? But she indeed was praying daily, that
we might close her eyes,1852 and shut and compose her mouth, and attend to all other things
pertaining to the burial; but now in this case, as one deserted, and deprived of a protector,
she will obtain none of these offices from her brother; of him whom she especially desired
to obtain them; but when she gives up the ghost, she will not see him whom she loved more
to have with her than all others? And will not this be heavier to her than dying many times
over? Yes, although I were far away, would it not be right to come with speed, and do, and
suffer any thing, for the purpose of shewing her this kindness? And now when I am near,
shall I leave her, and taking my departure abandon her? And how then will she sustain the
remainder of her days?”</p>
<p>4. Yet, so far was he from saying any of these things, that he did not even think of them;
but esteeming the fear of God above all the ties of kindred, he recognized the fact, that as
tempests display the pilot, and dangers the general, so also a time of trial makes the Priest
to become manifest. “All men,” saith he, “are eagerly looking on us; the Jews as well as the
Greeks; let us not confound the expectations which these have of us; let us not overlook so
great a shipwreck; but having committed to God all things that pertain to ourselves, let us
venture our life itself too!” Consider, moreover, the magnanimity of the Priest, and the
lovingkindness of God! All those things which he disregarded, all those he enjoyed; in order
that he might both receive the reward of his readiness, and that he might obtain a greater

<pb n="718"/>
pleasure by enjoying them contrary to expectation! He preferred to celebrate the festival in
a foreign place, and far from his own people, for the sake of the city’s safety. But God restored
him to us before the Paschal feast, so as to take a common part with us in the conduct of
the festival; in order that he might have the reward of his choice, and enjoy the greater
gladness! He feared not the season of the year; and there was summer during the whole
period he was travelling. He took not his age into account; and he dispatched this long
journey with just as much ease as if he had been young and sprightly! He thought not of his
sister’s decease nor was enervated by it, and when he returned he found her still alive, and
all things which were disregarded by him, were all obtained!</p>
<p>5. Thus, the priest hath indeed won renown both with God and man! This transaction
hath also adorned the Emperor with a splendour beyond the diadem! First, in that it was
then made apparent that he would grant that to the priests which he would not to any other;
secondly, that he granted the favour without delay, and quelled his resentment. But that
you may more clearly understand the magnanimity of the Emperor, and the wisdom of the
priest, and more than both these, the lovingkindness of God; allow me to relate to you a few
particulars of the conference which took place. But what I am now about to relate I learnt
from one of those who were within the palace; for the Father has told us neither much nor
little on the affair; but ever imitating the magnanimity of Paul, he hides his own good deeds;
and to those who on all sides were asking him questions as to what he said to the Emperor;
and how he prevailed upon him; and how he turned away his wrath entirely, he replied,
“We contributed nothing to the matter, but the Emperor himself (God having softened his
heart), even before we had spoken, dismissed his anger, and quelled his resentment; and
discoursing of the events that had taken place as if some other person had been insulted, he
thus went over all the events that had happened without anger.” But those things which he
concealed from humility, God hath brought to light.</p>
<p>6. And what were these? I will proceed to relate them to you by going a little farther
back in the story. When he went forth from the city, leaving all in such great despondency,
he endured what was far more grievous than we ourselves suffered, who were in the midst
of these calamities. For, in the first place, meeting in the midst of his journey with those
who had been sent by the Emperor to make inquisition upon the events which had happened;
and learning from them, on what terms they were sent; and reflecting upon the dreadful
events that were in store for the city, the tumults, the confusion, the flight, the terror, the
agony, the perils, he wept a flood of tears, and his bowels were rent with compassion; for
with fathers, it is usual to grieve much more, when they are not able to be present with their
suffering children; which was just what this most tender-hearted man now endured; not
only lamenting the calamities which were in reserve for us, but that he was far away from
us, whist we were enduring them. But this was, however, for our safety. For as soon as he
had learned these things from them; more warmly did the fountain of his tears then gush

<pb n="719"/>
forth, and he betook himself to God with more fervent supplication; and spent his nights
without sleep, beseeching Him that He would succour the city, while enduring these things,
and make the mind of the Emperor more placable. And as soon as he came to that great
city, and had entered the royal palace, he stood before the Emperor at a distance,—speechless,—
weeping,—with downcast eyes,—covering his face as if he himself had been the doer
of all the mischief; and this he did, wishing first to incline him to mercy by his posture, and
aspect, and tears; and then to begin an apology on our behalf; since there is but one hope
of pardon for those who have offended, which is to be silent, and to utter nothing in defence
of what has been done. For he was desirous that one feeling should be got rid of, and that
another should take its place; that anger should be expelled, and sadness introduced,1853 in
order that he might thus prepare the way for the words of his apology; which indeed actually
took place. And just as Moses going up to the mount, when the people had offended, stood
speechless himself, until God called him, saying, “Let me alone, and I will blot out this
people;”1854 so also did he now act: The Emperor therefore, when he saw him shedding
tears, and bending toward the ground, himself drew near; and what he really felt on seeing
the tears of the priest, he made evident by the words he addressed to him; for they were not
those of a person provoked or inflamed, but of one in sorrow; not of one enraged, but rather
dejected, and under constraint of extreme pain.</p>
<p>7. And that this is true, ye will understand when ye hear what were his words. For he
did not say, “What does this mean? Hast thou come heading an embassy on behalf of impious
and abominable men, such as ought not even to live; on behalf of rebels,1855 of revolutionists,
who deserve the utmost punishment?” But dismissing all words of that sort, he composed
a defence of himself full of respectfulness and dignity; and he enumerated the benefits, which
during the whole time of his reign he had conferred upon the city; and at each of these he
said, “Was it thus I should have been treated in return for these things? What injuries had
I done, that they should take such revenge? What complaint had they, great or small, that
they must not insult me only, but the deceased also?1856 Was it not sufficient to wreak their
resentment against the living? Yet they thought they were doing nothing grand, unless they
insulted those now in their graves. Granting that I had injured them, as they suppose; surely
it would have been becoming to spare the dead, who had done them no wrong; for they
could not have the same complaint against them. Did I not ever esteem this city above every

thing, and account it as dearer than my native place? And was it not a matter of my continual
prayers to visit this city; and did I not make this my oath1857 to all men?”</p>
<p>8. Upon this, the priest sobbing bitterly, and shedding warmer tears, no longer kept silence:
for he saw that the defence of the Emperor was raising our crime to a still higher
amount; but heaving from the bottom of his heart1858 a deep and bitter sigh, he said, “We
must confess, O Emperor, this love which you have shewn towards our country! We cannot
deny it! On this account, especially, we mourn, that a city thus beloved has been bewitched
by demons; and that we should have appeared ungrateful towards her benefactor, and have
provoked her ardent lover. And although you were to overthrow; although you were to
burn; although you were to put to death; or whatever else you might do, you would never
yet have taken on us the revenge we deserve. We ourselves have, by anticipation, inflicted
on ourselves what is worse than a thousand deaths! For what can be more bitter, than when
we are found to have unjustly provoked our benefactor, and one who loved us so much,
and the whole world knows it, and condemns us for the most monstrous ingratitude! If
Barbarians had made an incursion on our city,1859 and razed its walls, and burnt its houses,
and had taken and carried us away captive, the evil had been less. And why so? but because,
whilst you live, and continue such a generous kindness towards us, there might be a hope
that we might again be brought back to our former condition, and regain a more illustrious
liberty. But now, having been deprived of your favour, and having quenched your love,
which was a greater security to us than any wall, whom have we left to fly to? Where else
shall we have to look, when we have provoked so benign a lord, so indulgent a father? So
that while they seem to have committed offences of the most intolerable kind, they have on
the other hand suffered the most terrible evils; not daring to look any man in the face; nor
being able to look upon the sun with free eyes; shame everywhere weighing down their
eyelids, and compelling them to hide their heads! Deprived of their confidence, they are
now in a more miserable condition than any captives, and undergo the utmost dishonour;
and whilst thinking of the magnitude of their evils, and the height of insolence to which
they have rushed, they can scarce draw breath; inasmuch as they have drawn on their own
heads severer reproaches from all the inhabitants of the world, than even from him who is
seen to have been insulted.</p>
<p>9. But yet, O Emperor, if you are willing, there is a remedy for the wound, and a medicine
for these evils, mighty as they are! Often, indeed, has it occurred amongst private individuals,
that great and insufferable offences have become a foundation for great affection. Thus also
did it happen in the case of our human race. For when God made man, and placed him in

<pb n="721"/>
Paradise, and held him in much honour; the devil could not bear this his great prosperity,
and envied him, and cast him out from that dignity which had been granted. But God was
so far from forsaking him, that He even opened Heaven to us instead of Paradise; and in so
doing, both shewed His own lovingkindness, and punished the devil the more severely. So
do thou too now! The demons have lately used all their efforts, that they may effectually
rend from your favour that city which was dearest of all to you. Knowing this then, demand
what penalty you will, but let us not become outcasts from your former love! Nay, though
it is a strange thing, I must say, display towards us now still greater kindness than ever; and
again write this city’s name among the foremost in your love;—if you are indeed desirous
of being revenged upon the demons who were the instigators of these crimes! For if you
pull down, and overturn, and raze the city, you will be doing those very things which they
have long been desiring. But if you dismiss your anger, and again avow that you love it even
as you did before, you have given them a deadly blow. You have taken the most perfect revenge
upon them by shewing, not only that nothing whatever has come for them of their
evil designs; but that all hath proved the very opposite of what they wished. And you would
be just in acting thus, and in shewing mercy to a city, which the demons envied on account
of your affection; for if you had not so exceedingly loved her, they would not have envied
her to such a degree! So that even if what I have asserted is extraordinary, it is nevertheless,
true, that what the city hath suffered, hath been owing to thee, and thy love! What burning,
what devastation, so bitter as those words, which you uttered in your own defence?</p>
<p>10. You say now, that you have been insulted, and sustained wrongs such as no Emperor
ever yet did. But if you will, O most gracious, most wise, and most religious Sovereign, this
contempt will procure you a crown, more honourable and splendid than the diadem you
wear! For this diadem is a display of your princely virtue, but it is also a token of the munificence
of him who gave it; but the crown woven from this your humanity will be entirely
your own good work, and that of your own love of wisdom; and all men will admire you
less for the sake of these precious stones,1860 than they will applaud you for your superiority
over this wrath. Were your Statues thrown down? You have it in your power again to set
up others yet more splendid. For if you remit the offences of those who have done you injury,
and take no revenge upon them, they will erect a statue to you, not one in the forum of brass,
nor of gold, nor inlaid with gems; but one arrayed in that robe which is more precious than
any material, that of humanity and tender mercy! Every man will thus set you up in his own
soul; and you will have as many statues, as there are men who now inhabit, or shall hereafter
<note type="footnote">1860 It is here evidently supposed that the Emperor appeared with the crown actually upon his head. The
magnificence of the Emperor’s appearance is dwelt upon at length by Chrysostom in other Homilies, though
with different feelings from what Gibbon would insinuate. See c. xxxii. where he quotes the Homily on Perfect
Charity (6). Also on Eph. iv. 1, Hom. IX.</note>

<pb n="722"/>
inhabit, the whole world! For not only we, but all those who come after us, and their successors,
will hear of these things, and will admire and love you, just as if they themselves
had experienced this kindness!</p>
<p>11. And to shew that I do not speak this in a way of flattery, but that it will certainly be
so, I will relate to you an ancient piece of history, that you may understand that no armies,
nor warlike weapons, nor money, nor multitude of subjects, nor any other such things are
wont to make sovereigns so illustrious, as wisdom of soul and gentleness. It is related of the
blessed Constantine, that on one occasion, when a statue of himself had been pelted with
stones, and many were instigating him to proceed against the perpetrators of the outrage;
saying, that they had disfigured his whole face by battering it with stones, he stroked his
face with his hand, and smiling gently, said, “I am quite unable to perceive any wound inflicted
upon my face. The head appears sound, and the face also quite sound.” Thus these
persons, overwhelmed with shame, desisted from their unrighteous counsel.</p>
<p>This saying, even to the present day, all repeat; and length of time hath neither weakened
nor extinguished the memory of such exalted wisdom. How much more illustrious is such
an action, than any number of warlike trophies! Many and great titles did he build, and
many barbarous tribes did he conquer; not one of which we now remember; but this saying
is repeated over and over again, to the present day; and those who follow us, as well as those
who come after them, will all hear of it. Nor indeed is this the only admirable thing; that
they will hear of it; but that when men speak of it, they do so with approbation and applause;
and those who hear of it, receive it with the like; and there is no one who, when he has heard
it, is able to remain silent, but each at once cries out, and applauds the man who uttered it,
and prays that innumerable blessings may be his lot even now deceased. But if amongst
men, this saying has gained him so much honour, how many crowns will he obtain with
the merciful God!</p>
<p>12. And why need I speak of Constantine, and other men’s examples, when it were fitting
that I should exhort you by considerations nearer home, and drawn from your own praiseworthy
actions. You remember how but lately, when this feast was near at hand, you sent
an epistle to every part of the world giving orders that the inmates of the prisons should be
set free, and their crimes be pardoned. And as if this were not sufficient to give proof of
your generosity, you said in your letters, “O that it were possible for me to recal and to restore
those who are dead, and to bring them back to their former state of life!” Remember now
these words. Behold the season of recalling and restoring the deceased, and bringing them
back to former life! For these are indeed already dead, even before the sentence hath been
pronounced; and the city hath now taken up its tabernacle at the very gates of Hades!
Therefore raise it up again, which you can do without money, without expense, without loss
of time or labour! It is sufficient merely for you to open your lips, and you will restore to
life the city which at present lieth in darkness. Grant now, that henceforth it may bear an

appellation derived from your philanthropy; for it will not be so much indebted to the
kindness of him who first founded it, as it will be to your sentence. And this is exceedingly
reasonable; for he but gave it its beginning, and departed; but you, when it had grown up
and become great; and when it was fallen, after all that great prosperity; will have been its
restorer. There would have been nothing so wonderful in your having delivered it from
danger, when enemies had captured, and barbarians overrun it, as in your now sparing it.
That, many of the Emperors have frequently done; but should you alone accomplish this,
you will be first in doing it, and that beyond all expectation. And the former of these good
deeds, the protection of your subjects, is not at all wonderful or extraordinary; but is one of
those events which are of continual occurrence; but the latter, the dismissal of wrath after
the endurance of such provocations, is something which surpasses human nature.</p>
<p>13. Reflect, that the matter now for your consideration is not respecting this city only,
but is one that concerns your own glory; or rather, one that affects the cause of Christianity
in general. Even now the Gentiles, and Jews, and the whole empire as well as the barbarians,
(for these last have also heard of these events,) are eagerly looking to you, and waiting to
see what sentence you will pronounce with regard to these transactions. And should you
decree a humane and merciful one; all will applaud the decision, and glorify God, and say
one to another, “Heavens! how great is the power of Christianity, that it restrains and bridles
a man who has no equal upon earth; a sovereign, powerful enough to destroy and devastate
all things; and teaches him to practice such philosophy as one in a private station had not
been likely to display! Great indeed must be the God of the Christians, who makes angels
out of men, and renders them superior to all the constraining force of our nature!”</p>
<p>14. Nor ought you, assuredly, to entertain that idle fear; nor to bear with those who say
that other cites will become worse, and grow more contemptuous of authority, if this city
goes unpunished. For if you were unable to take vengeance; and they, after doing these
things, had forcibly defied you; and the power on each side was equally matched; then
reasonably enough might such suspicions be entertained. But if, terrified and half dead with
fear, they run to cast themselves at your feet, through me; and expect daily nothing else but
the pit of slaughter, and are engaged in common supplications; looking up to heaven and
calling upon God to come to their aid, and to favour this our embassy; and have each given
charge about his private affairs, as if they were at their last gasp; how can such a fear be
otherwise than superfluous? If they had been ordered to be put to death, they would not
have suffered as much as they do now, living as they have done so many days in fear and
trembling; and when the evening approaches, not expecting to behold the morning; nor
when the day arrives, hoping to reach the evening! Many too have fallen in with wild beasts,
while pursuing their way through desert places, and removing to untrodden spots; and not
men only, but also little children and women; free born, and of good condition; hiding
themselves many days and nights in caves, and ravines, and holes of the desert! A new mode

<pb n="724"/>
of captivity hath indeed befallen the city. Whilst the buildings and walls are standing, they
suffer heavier calamities than when cities have been set on fire! Whilst no barbarian foe is
present, whilst no enemy appears, they are more wretchedly situated than if actually taken;
and the rustling only of a leaf scares them all every day! And these are matters which are
universally known; so that if all men had seen the city razed to the ground, they would not
have been taught such a lesson of sobriety, as by hearing of the calamities which have now
befallen it. Suppose not, therefore, that other cities will be made worse in future! Not even
if you had overturned other cities, would you have so effectually corrected them, as now,
by this suspense concerning their fate, having chastised1861 them more severely than by any
punishment!</p>
<p>15. Do not, then, carry this calamity any farther; but allow them henceforth to take
breath again. For to punish the guilty, and to exact the penalty for these deeds, were easy
and open to any one; but to spare those who have insulted you, and to pardon those who
have committed offences undeserving of pardon, is an act of which only some one or two
are capable; and especially so, where the person treated with indignity is the Emperor. It is
an easy matter to place the city under the subjection of fear; but to dispose all to be loving
subjects; and to persuade them to hold themselves well affected towards your government;
and to offer not only their common, but individual prayers for your empire; is a work of
difficulty. A monarch might expend his treasures, or put innumerable troops in motion, or
do what else he pleased, but still he would not be able to draw the affections of so many men
towards himself as may now very easily be done. For they who have been kindly dealt with,
and those who hear of it too, will be well affected towards you, even as the recipients of the
benefit. How much money, how many labours would you not have expended to win over
to yourself the whole world in a short space of time; and to be able to persuade all those
men who are now in existence, as well as all future generations, to invoke upon your head
the same blessings which they pray for on behalf of their own children! And if you will receive
such a reward from men, how much greater will you have from God! And this, not merely
from the events which are now taking place, but from those good deeds which shall be performed
by others in time to come. For if ever it should be that an event similar to what has
now occurred should take place, (which God forbid!) and any of those who have been treated
with indignity, should then be consulting about prosecuting measures against the rioters;
your gentleness and moral wisdom will serve them instead of all other teaching and admonition;
and they will blush and be ashamed, having such an example of wisdom, to appear
inferior. So that in this way you will be an instructor to all posterity; and you will obtain the
palm amongst them, even although they should attain to the highest point of moral wisdom!
For it is not the same thing for a person to set the first example of such meekness himself
<note type="footnote">1861 αὐτοὺς, “the Antiochenes.” Some read αὐτὰς, “the cities,” which does not make so good sense.</note>

<pb n="725"/>
and by looking at others, to imitate the good actions they have performed. On this account,
whatever philanthropy, or meekness, those who come after you may display, you will enjoy
the reward along with them; for he who provides the root, must be considered the source
of the fruits. For this reason, no one can possibly now share with you the reward that will
follow your generosity, since the good deed hath been entirely your own. But you will share
the reward of all those who shall come after, if any such persons should make their appearance;
and it will be in your power to have an equal share in the merit of the good work along
with them, and to carry off a portion as great as teachers have with scholars. And supposing
that no such person should come into being, the tribute of commendation and applause
will be accumulating to you throughout every age.</p>
<p>16. For consider, what it is for all posterity to hear it reported, that when so great a city
had become obnoxious to punishment and vengeance, that when all were terrified, when
its generals, its magistrates and judges, were all in horror and alarm, and did not dare to
utter a word on behalf of the wretched people; a single old man, invested with the priesthood
of God, came and moved the heart of the Monarch by his mere aspect and intercourse; and
that the favour which he bestowed upon no other of his subjects, he granted to this one old
man, being actuated by a reverence for God’s laws! For in this very thing, O Emperor, that
I have been sent hither on this embassy, the city hath done you no small honour; for they
have thus pronounced the best and the most honourable judgment on you, which is, that
you respect the priests of God, however insignificant they may be, more than any office
placed under your authority!</p>
<p>17. But at the present time I have come not from these only, but rather from One who
is the common Lord of angels and men, to address these words to your most merciful and
most gentle soul, “if ye forgive men their debts, your heavenly Father will forgive you your
trespasses.”1862 Remember then that Day when we shall all give an account of our actions!
Consider that if you have sinned in any respect, you will be able to wipe away all offences
by this sentence1863 and by this determination, and that without difficulty and without toil.
Some when they go on an embassy, bring gold, and silver, and other gifts of that kind. But
I am come into your royal presence with the sacred laws; and instead of all other gifts, I
present these; and I exhort you to imitate your Lord, who whilst He is daily insulted by us,
unceasingly ministers His blessings to all! And do not confound our hopes, nor defeat our
promises.1864 For I wish you withal to understand, that if it be your resolution to be recon-

<pb n="726"/>
ciled, and to restore your former kindness to the city, and to remit this just displeasure, I
shall go back with great confidence. But if you determine to cast off the city, I shall not only
never return to it, nor see its soil again, but I shall in future utterly disown it, and enrol
myself a member of some other city; for God forbid that I should ever belong to that country,
which you, the most mild and merciful of all men, refuse to admit to peace and reconciliation!</p>
<p>18. Having said this, and much more to the same effect, he so overcame the Emperor,
that the same thing occurred which once happened to Joseph. For just as he, when he beheld
his brethren, longed to shed tears, but restrained his feeling, in order that he might not spoil
the part which he was playing;1865 even so did the Emperor mentally weep, but did not let
it be seen, for the sake of those who were present. He was not, however, able to conceal the
feeling at the close of the conference; but betrayed himself, though against his will. For after
this speech was finished, no further words were necessary, but he gave utterance to one only
sentiment, which did him much more honour than the diadem. And what was that? “How,
said he, “can it be any thing wonderful or great, that we should remit our anger against those
who have treated us with indignity; we, who ourselves are but men; when the Lord of the
universe, having come as He did on earth, and having been made a servant for us, and crucified
by those who had experienced His kindness, besought the Father on behalf of His
crucifiers, saying, “Forgive them, for they know not what they do?”1866 What marvel, then,
if we also should forgive our fellow-servants! And that these words were not a pretence was
proved by all that followed. And not the least, that particular circumstance which I am now
about to mention; for this our priest, when he would have remained there, and celebrated
the feast together with himself, he urged, though contrary to what he would have wished,—to
use all speed, and diligence, to present himself to his fellow-citizens. “I know,” said he, “that
their souls are still agitated; and that there are many relics of the calamity left. Go, give them
consolation! If they see the helmsman, they will no longer remember the storm that has
passed away; but all recollection of these sorrowful events will be effaced!” And when the
Priest was urgent, entreating him to send his own son, he, wishing to give the most satisfactory
proof of his having entirely blotted out from his soul every wrathful feeling, answered;
“Pray that these hindrances may be taken out of the way; that these wars may be put an end
to;1867 and then I will certainly come myself.”</p>
<p>19. What could be gentler than such a soul? Let the Gentiles henceforward be ashamed;
or rather, instead of being ashamed, let them be instructed; and leaving their native error,
let them come back1868 to the strength of Christianity, having learned what our philosophy

<pb n="727"/>
is, from the example of the Emperor and of the Priest! For our most pious Emperor stayed
not at this point; but when the Bishop had left the city, and come over the sea, he dispatched
thither also certain persons, being most solicitous and painstaking to prevent any waste of
time lest the city should be thus deprived of half its pleasure, whilst the bishop was celebrating
the feast beyond its walls. Where is the gracious father that would have so busied himself
on behalf of those who had insulted him? But I must mention another circumstance that
redounds to the praise of the just man.1869 For when he had accomplished this, he did not
make it his endeavour, as any one else might have done, who was fond of glory, to deliver
those letters himself, which were to set us free from the state of dejection in which we were;
but since he was journeying at too slow a rate for this, he thought proper to send forward
another person in his stead; one among those who were skilled in horsemanship, to be the
bearer of the good news to the city;1870 lest its sadness should be prolonged by the tardiness
of his arrival. For the only thing he earnestly coveted was this; not that he might come
himself, bringing these favourable tidings, so full of all that is delightful, but that our country
might as soon as possible breathe freely again.</p>
<p>20. What therefore ye then did, in decking the forum with garlands; lighting lamps,
spreading couches1871 of green leaves before the shops, and keeping high festival, as if the
city had just come into being, this do ye, although in another manner, throughout all
time;—being crowned, not with flowers, but with virtue;—kindling in your souls the light
which comes from good works; rejoicing with a spiritual gladness. And let us never fail to
give God thanks continually for all these things, not only that he hath freed us from these
calamities, but that he also permitted them to happen; and let us acknowledge his abundant
goodness! for by both these has He adorned our city.1872 Now all these things according to
the prophetic saying, “Declare ye to your children; and let your children tell their children;
and their children again another generation.”1873 So that all who shall be hereafter, even to
the consummation, learning this act of God’s lovingkindness towards the city, may call us

temporary couches, made of, or strewed with, green leaves, for a public feast. (Libanius mentions this feasting,
and praises the sympathy and good nature of Hellebichus on the occasion. His mention of a fish may be connected

blessed, in having enjoyed such a favour;—may marvel at our Sovereign, who raised up the
city when it was so grievously falling;—and may themselves be profited, being stimulated
to piety by means of all which has happened! For the history of what has lately happened
to us, will have power to profit not only ourselves, if we constantly remember it, but also
those who shall come after us. All these things then being considered, let us always give
thanks to God who loveth man; not merely for our deliverance from these fearful evils, but
for their being permitted to overtake us,—learning this from the divine Scriptures, as well
as from the late events that have befallen us; that He ever disposes all things for our advantage,
with that lovingkindness which is His attribute, which God grant, that we may continually
enjoy, and so may obtain the kingdom of heaven, in Christ Jesus our Lord; to whom be glory
and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

<head>Conferences of John Cassian by John Cassian</head>
<p>Conferences of John Cassian offer the modern Christian a glimpse into the lives of second
and third century Christian monastics. It documents the thoughts of Christians who took
Jesus' instructions to take up our own cross, leave our family, and renounce our possessions
literally. The Conferences of John Cassian is an early archetype of the monastic way of life
where the theology of denying self is implemented in daily living. Cassian's work was highly
respected by his contemporaries, as well as those who went on to have enormous influence
on the monastic movement. St. Benedict referenced Cassian's work while writing The Rule
of St. Benedict, which went on to be the rule of life for countless Benedictine monks.</p>

<head>NPNF1-03. On the Holy Trinity; Doctrinal Treatises; Moral Treatises
by Philip Schaff</head>
<p>With over twenty volumes, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a momentous achievement.
Originally gathered by Philip Schaff, the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is a collection of
writings by classical and medieval Christian theologians. The purpose of such a collection
is to make their writings readily available. The entire work is divided into two series. The
first series focuses on two classical Christian theologians--St. Augustine and St. John
Chrysostom. St. Augustine is one of the most influential and important Christian thinkers
of all time. In addition to reprinting his most popular two works--the Confessions and the
City of God--these volumes also contain other noteworthy and important works of St. Augustine,
such as On the Holy Trinity, Christian Doctrine, and others. St. John Chrysostom
was an eloquent speaker and well-loved Christian clergyman. St. John took a more literal
interpretation of Scripture, and much of his work focused on practical aspects of Christianity,
particularly what is now called social justice. He advocated for the poor, and challenged
abuses of authority. This particular volume contains Augustine's On the Holy Trinity and
treatises on morality and doctrine. The Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers is comprehensive
in scope, and provide keen translations of instructive and illuminating texts from some of
the greatest theologians of the Christian church. These spiritually enlightening texts have
aided Christians for over a thousand years, and remain instructive and fruitful even today!
